   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;In the end, however, Lavoisier would
   become a chemist. He would specialize in chemical analysis:
   separating elements from mixtures and measuring out the elements
   of compounds were activities well suited to his analytical mind.
   It was in Rouelle's chemistry courses that he was going to acquire
   the techniques necessary for his studies of mineralogy and
   hydrology.&nbsp;<BR>

   <BR>
   
   Around 1750, chemistry was seeking to gain its independence from
   the four disciplines which had engendered it: industry, the
   natural sciences, alchemy and medicine.<BR>
   
   Industry - building construction, metallurgy, the fabrication of
   glass and textiles, processing of leather, production of gunpowder
   and saltpeter, food preservation - was making governments aware of
   the possibilities for applied chemistry. Concurrently, the natural
   sciences were undergoing rapid development and alchemy was
   contributing to methods of distillation and sublimation for
   preparing drugs. Distillation soon shed its mystery, becoming a
   simple method of analysis. But it was especially medicine which,
   since the sixteenth century, had been promoting the development of
   chemistry through pharmacy. Men such as the Swiss Leonhard
   Thurneysser (1530-1595), the Italian Angelo Sala (1576-1637), the
   Germans Johann Glauber (1604-1670), Otto Tachenius (1630-1700),
   Johann Kunckel (1630-703) and Johann Becher (1635-1682) created
   medical chemistry. in 1597, Andreas Libavius published in
   Frankfort Alchymia recognita, emendata et aucta, cum dogmatibus et
   experimentis nonnullis, cum commentario medico-physico-chymicothe
   first collection of chemical texts. The title clearly indicates
   its links with medicine and pharmacy. In 1609, Johannes Hartmann
   gave the first courses in chemistry at the University of
   Marburg.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In France, Bernard Palissy (1520-1590), who can be considered the
   first professor of chemistry, had denounced the teachings of
   certain professors, whom he considered charlatans. He advocated
   returning to the observations of nature. It was at Sedan,
   Montpellier and Paris that the links between chemistry and
   pharmacy were forged. In 1610, Jean B&eacute;guin (1605- ? )
   published in Paris the Tyrocinium chymicum e naturae fonte et
   manuali experiencia depromptum, the prototype of pharmaceutical
   texts which would have more than fifty editions. In 1635, Jean
   Riolan (1580-1657), eminent member of the Faculty of Medicine in
   Paris, created the Jardin du Roy. Initially destined uniquely for
   growing medicinal plants, it soon became an important center for
   the teaching of chemistry. The first "demonstrator," Guillaume
   Davisson (1593-1669) was hired in 1648. He was succeeded by
   Nicolas Lef&egrave;vre (1615-1669) and then by Christopher Glaser
   (1628-1672). In 1666, Colbert created the Academy of Sciences
   which among its twenty-one members included two chemists: Claude
   Bourdelin (1621-1699), a pharmacist, and Samuel Cottereau du Clos
   ( ? - 1715), physician to the King. In 1691, Wilhelm Homberg
   (1652-1715) joined them and gave the first modern definition of
   mineral salts: "Acids combine with fixed salts to compose bivalent
   salts according to the nature of the acids that have been used.
   For example, spirits of nitre added to tartar salt produces true
   common salt, spirits of vitriol combined with tartar salt produces
   true vitriol. Both are bivalent salts, that is partially fixed,
   partially volatile, because the two salts that compose them are
   and remain fixed and volatile, respectively." (W. Homberg, quoted
   by F. L. Holmes in "Cum grano salis," </FONT><I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">Cahiers de Science et Vie</FONT></I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">, no. 14, Paris, 1993, p. 81.) The successors,
   Mo&iuml;se Charas (1619-1698), G.F. Boulduc (1675-1742) and
   Nicolas L&eacute;mery (1645-1715), abandoned the old technique of
   analyzing salts by heating them dry and developed the more
   rigorous method of analysis in solution. Thus they could define
   precisely a growing number of acids and bases. In 1737, Henri
   Louis Duhamel du Monceau (1700-1782) isolated two types of fixed
   alkalis: one drawn from plant ashes (potassium hydroxide or
   potash), the other derived from sea water (soda). In Prussia,
   Frederick I reorganized the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1744.
   Johann Pott (1692-1777) published there his celebrated
   Lith&eacute;og&eacute;ognosie ou examen chymique des pierres et
   des terres en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral. Andreas Marggraf (1709-1780)
   produced phosphorus from the phosphates found in urine, discovered
   magnesia and manganese, studies phosphoric acid and platinum and
   extracted zinc from its minerals. "Around 1750 then, " writes F.L.
   Holmes, "chemists began to dare to venture beyond the limits of
   what was known, discovering new acids and new bases, combining
   them to form new salts or, conversely, extracting known salts from
   acids and bases not yet identified." ("Lavoisier," Cahiers de
   Science et Vie, no. 14, Paris 1993, p. 82.) In France, Louis
   L&eacute;mery (1677-1743), Etienne Fran&ccedil;ois Geoffroy
   (1672-1731) and Pierre Joseph Macquer (1718-1784) were
   congratulating themselves on this rapid progress. And yet
   chemistry was still far from being an independent discipline.
   Bartolomeo Beccaria (1716-1781), holder of the first chair in
   chemistry at Bologna n 1737, also taught medicine and pharmacy.
   Georg Ernst Stahl (1660-1734) was a professor of medicine at
   Halle, as was his student, Frederick Hoffman (1660-1743). Joseph
   Black (1728-1799) wrote his famous paper, Experiments on Magnesis
   Allba, with the goal of providing a treatment for kidney stones.
   Louis de La Planche, Antoine Baum&eacute; (1728-1804) and Gabriel
   Francis Venel (1723-1775) taught as much medicine and pharmacy as
   chemistry. Along with his course in chemistry, Rouelle gave
   lectures in pharmacy in which he specified, "There should be a
   distinction between the pharmaceutical production process and
   chemistry. Without the latter, the former makes only chance
   combinations and mixtures which, far from reaching the desired
   end, are often very harmful. It is chemistry that lays the
   foundations for all good pharmacy. It is from the exact knowledge
   of analysis that principles are deduced." (G.F. Rouelle,
   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Cours de Pharmacie, manuscript
   </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">in 1 vol. in 4&#176;, p. 4.) But
   the old concepts continued to reign.<BR>

   FACE="Geneva"><BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Rouelle, Lavoisier's professor, was still defining the constituent
   elements of matter as Aristotle had: "We call principles or
   elements simple, homogeneous, indivisible, immutable and
   insensible bodies, more or less mobile according to their
   different configurations, stature and mass, and which are
   differentiated by their volume and particular figure. It is
   impossible to detect them in isolation, separated from other
   elements, unless they come together in a very large numerical
   quantity. Their particular figure is also unknown and it would be
   quite ridiculous to pretend to determine it, as several physicists
   have done. What can be ascertained is that they exist in very
   small numbers and yet their different combinations suffice to form
   all the bodies found in Nature. We acknowledge four principles or
   elements: phlogiston or fire, earth, water and air." (G.F.
   Rouelle,</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Cours de
   Chymie</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, pp. 27-28.)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Meanwhile, Macquer wrote in 1756, in El&eacute;ments de chymie
   th&eacute;orique:: " The object and principal goal of chemistry is
   to separate the different substances composing a body, examine
   each one individually, determine their properties and analogies,
   decompose them still another time if that is possible; compare and
   combine them with other substances, reunite them and put them back
   together so as to cause the reappearance of the first mixture with
   all its properties; or by differently combined mixtures, produce
   anew composed bodies for which not even Nature has given us a
   model . But this analysis and decomposition of bodies is limited:
   we can pursue it only up to a certain point, beyond which all our
   efforts are useless. Regardless of how we proceed, we are always
   stopped by substances that are stable, that we cannot decompose
   and which serve as barriers to our progress. It is these
   substances that we must, I believe, call principles or elements.
   At least, they are truly so for us. Such substances are
   principally earth and water, air and fire. For although there is
   reason to believe that these substances are not the essential
   parts of matter, are not its simplest elements - since experience
   has taught us that it is impossible to recognize by our senses the
   principles of which they are themselves composed -, I believe that
   it is more reasonable to stop there, and to consider them as
   simple, homogeneous bodies and the principles of other bodies."
   (P. Macquer, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Elements de chymie
   th&eacute;orique</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, Paris,
   Jean-Thomas H&eacute;rissant, 1756, pp. 1-2.)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Lavoisier was soon to expose the archaic character of these ideas:
   "A very remarkable thing," he wrote, "is that while teaching the
   doctrine of the four elements, no chemist has been led by the
   force of evidence to acknowledge a larger number. (...) All that
   can be said on the number and nature of elements is limited, I
   believe, to purely metaphysical discussions: the problems which
   one proposes to resolve are unspecified and susceptible to an
   infinity of solutions. But it is most likely that none in
   particular agrees with Nature." (Lavoisier, </FONT><I><FONT

   &nbsp; <A NAME="Phlogiston"></A></FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The
   Theory of Phlogiston</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"><BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   This theory, formulated by Georg Ernst Stahl, had been accepted by
   all chemists. Its object was to explain the combustion of bodies
   and the calcination of metals. The effect of these phenomena,
   according to Stahl, was to release phlogiston, the inflammable and
   subtle principle contained in these materials. The loss of
   phlogiston transformed metals into calx, or metallic oxides with
   very different physical properties (brilliance, ductility and
   malleability). But it is in the form of oxides that metallurgists
   receive metallic minerals from mines. To obtain the original
   metals, they believed they had to restore the missing phlogiston
   to the oxides, and thus conducted an operation that was the
   opposite of calcination, that is, a reduction in the presence of
   charcoal. Stahl's theory had the advantage of explaining not only
   the phenomena of combustion, calcination, the reduction of metals,
   and the solution of metals by acids but even that of the
   respiration of human beings. But its major flaw was to be purely
   qualitative and not quantitative. If calcination consisted of
   releasing the phlogiston contained in a metal, one should be able
   to observe a decrease in the weight of the product obtained. But
   the products of the calcination of metals are heavier than the
   original metals. Stahl recognized the contradiction, but made no
   attempt to explain it. Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau (1737-1816)
   suggested that the phlogiston released from the calcined metal was
   replaced by air, heavier than it, and that, therefore, phlogiston
   was endowed with a negative weight. Lavoisier, who believed in the
   mathematical virtue of the scale, accepted neither the theory nor
   the hypothesis: his faith in the law of the conservation of matter
   forbade him to do so.<BR>

   <BR>
   
   In 1771, it was still believed possible to transmute one element
   into another. Johann Gottschalk Wallerius (1709-1785) was one of
   the proponents of the theory of the transmutation of metals. In
   his lectures, Rouelle still reserved a place for ideas coming from
   traditional alchemy: " Ordinary chemists doubt the truth of the
   principles of this science, but they cannot be judges in a matter
   entirely unknown to them. (...) Although I do not wish to cast
   doubt on the testimony of great men who affirm that they have seen
   transmutations, I would like to see for myself before shedding my
   remaining reservations. However, I would not advise anyone to
   attempt such expensive undertakings given the uncertainty of the
   outcome, unless he has a reliable guide to lead him in an
   operation which is preserved only by tradition." (G.F. Rouelle,
   quoted by M. Daumas, </FONT><I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">Lavoisier</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, Paris,
   Gallimard, 1941, pp. 27-28.)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   A Swiss scientist, Bengt Ferner, attributed the steady lowering of
   the levels of the oceans to a transformation of water into earth.
   This hypothesis was accepted by a number of chemists who, after a
   prolonged boiling and evaporation of water, found an earthy
   residue at the bottom of the recipient. According to Stahl
   himself, "Water, through a great number of repeated distillations
   can be carried to such a degree of refinement that it can
   penetrate glass ." (G.E. Stahl, quoted by Lavoisier, "Does the
   Purest Water Contain Soil and Can This Water be Changed into
   Soil?" , Introduction aux </FONT><I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">Observations sur la physique</FONT></I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">, Paris, Le Jay et Barrois, 1777, vol. 1, p. 79.)
   But Boerhaave in his El&eacute;ments de chymie, Duhamel du Monceau
   in his Physique des arbres and Le Roy in a paper read at the
   Academy contested the possibility that water could change into
   earth.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In one of his first works, Lavoisier attacked this myth of the
   transmutation of water into earth. He boiled water for a hundred
   days in a "pelican", a glass recipient whose shape resembles the
   bird's form, and demonstrated that the residue obtained was not
   due to a transmutation of water, but rather to the dissolving of
   the pelican's inner surface in the water. He carried out this
   demonstration by applying for the first time what would become the
   basis of his scientific method: the weighing of the elements of
   reaction thanks to the use of precise scales.<BR>

   In the article, Chymie, in the Encyclop&eacute;die, Venel
   prophecied: "It is clear that the revolution which would place
   chemistry in the rank it merits - which would at least place it
   alongside experimental physics - can be carried out only by a
   clever, enthusiastic, and bold chemist who, finding himself in a
   favorable position and skillfully profiting from a few fortunate
   circumstances, can attract the attention of scientists, first by a
   noisy ostentation and a determined, assertive tone, and then by
   reason, if his first method has stirred up prejudice." The
   ambitious Lavoisier was determined to be that chemist.

   Fran&ccedil;ois Venel, a doctor from Montpellier and Inspector
   General of Mineral Waters, was along with his friend Pierre Bayen,
   a pharmacist and chemist, responsible for analyzing all the
   mineral waters in France. "He is better known for what he has
   promised to the sciences than for what he as actually done for

   <BR>
   
   In 1768, the death of Th&eacute;odore Baron liberated a place for
   a chemist at the Royal Academy of Sciences. Lavoisier had been on
   the list of candidates for two years. Supported by his father's
   friends, Maraldi and Duhamel du Monceau as well as by Bernard de
   Jussieu, Macquer and Joseph J&eacute;rome Le Fran&ccedil;ois de
   Lalande (1732-1807), he was elected. On Wednesday June 1, 1768 he
   sat for the first time at the Academy. He would remain there for
   twenty-five years, taking on increasing responsibilities. His
   first papers were reports on analysis: studies of gypsum, the
   diamond, meteorites, charcoal, lead and mineral waters. He
   perfected a new model of the hydrometer which he used to measure
   the density of mineral waters. His work was always on a high
   level, but contained nothing revolutionary.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   One has the impression that he had not yet found a research
   subject worthy of his talents. But, on the other hand, he had
   already defined his working method, based on three principles: 1-
   Every chemical reaction is an equation; this equality is of a
   quantitative nature and is verified by weighing the bodies before
   the reaction and the new compositions at its conclusion. 2- The
   validity of a chemical analysis must be confirmed by a synthesis
   reconstituting exactly the original body from the elements defined
   by the analysis. 3- The principle of the conservation of matter is
   a mathematical law of general value and not just a simple
   philosophical concept, and it is applicable to all the sciences.
   In chemistry, it is verified by the systematic use of the
   scale.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Although the paternity of the law of the conservation of matter is
   generally attributed to Lavoisier, it was known well long before
   him. It goes back to the ancients Greeks. Anaxagoras expressed it
   this way in 450 B.C.: " Nothing is born or perishes, but already
   existing things combine, then separate anew." (Quoted by R.
   Taton,</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Histoire
   g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des sciences</FONT></I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">, Paris, P.U.F., 1957, vol. 1, p. 217.)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In 1630, in his Essais sur la recherche de la cause pour laquelle
   l'&eacute;tain et le plomb augmentent de poids quand on les
   calcine (Essays on the Search for the Reason that the Weights of
   Tin and Lead Increase When They are Calcined), Jean Rey
   (1583-1645), doctor from the P&eacute;rigord and correspondent of
   P&egrave;re Mersenne, wrote, "The heaviness is so closely linked
   to the basic matter of the elements that, when changing from one
   to the other, they always keep the same weight." (Jean Rey, Essais
   sur la recherche de la cause pour laquelle l'&eacute;tain et le
   plomb augmentent de poids quand on les calcine , new edition based
   on the original and supplemented by manuscripts from the

   <BR>
   
   In 1678, the Abb&eacute; Edme Mariotte (1620-1684) wrote in his
   Essai de logique: "It is a maxim or natural rule that nature makes
   nothing from nothing and that matter is never lost." In 1704,
   Isaac Newton (1642-1727), borrowing the atomists' argument on the
   eternal similarity of the material world, wrote in Optics that it
   seemed most likely that in the beginning matter had been formed
   into solid, massive hard, impenetrable and mobile particles of
   such size and shape and in such numbers and proportions as to make
   them most suited to the ends for which they were intended. For
   this very reason Newton believed primitive particles to be solid
   and incomparably harder than any of the "porous" bodies which they
   composed. He considered them to be so hard that they could never
   worn down or broken up, since nothing could, in the ordinary
   course of nature, divide into several parts what had originally
   been made whole "by the will of God himself." As long as the
   particles remain whole, he continued, they could make up over the
   centuries bodies of the same nature and texture. But if they were
   broken down, the nature of the things that had depended on these
   particles such as they had been, would inevitably change . The
   nature of water and earth composed of altered particles and
   fragments of these particles could not be of the same as that of
   water and earth which had been composed in the beginning with the
   whole particles. Consequently, he argued, so that nature can
   endure, the alteration of bodies must consist only of separations,
   new combinations and movements of these solid bodies, but in
   places where these particles are joined together and touch only
   slightly. (Newton, quoted by H. Metzger, in Newton,Stahl,
   Boerhaave et la doctrine chimique ,Paris, F&eacute;lix Alcan,
   1930, p. 30.) And in 1764, Dr. Chardenon asserted more simply: "It
   is a generally accepted principle that the absolute weight of a
   body can be increased only by adding new matter. The law of
   opposites thus indicates that they can become lighter only by the
   removal of these same parts." (Chardenon, "M&eacute;moire sur
   l'augmentation de poids des m&eacute;taux calcin&eacute;s,"
   in</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Memoires de l'Acad&eacute;mie de

   Although Lavoisier is not the author of the law, nor did he ever
   seek to demonstrate its exactitude, it was for him a true paradigm
   which entirely defined his scientific method: everything can be
   measured, hence calculated and, just as in a balance sheet, the
   total of the outflow must always equal that of the inflow. It was
   with this goal in mind that he commissioned the costly scales
   fabricated by the best craftsmen of the day, M&eacute;gni&eacute;
   and Fortin. His expression of the law in the Trait&eacute;
   &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire de chemie is interesting because it
   includes three notions that were essential for him: the
   experimental method, the method of equation, and that of analysis
   and synthesis. He wrote in the chapter on the fermentation of
   wine: "Nothing is created, neither in the operations of the art,
   nor in those of nature, and one can assume in principle that in
   every operation there is an equal quantity of matter before and
   after the operation, the qualtity and the quantity of the
   principles are the same, and that there are only modifications.
   The entire art of carrying out experiments in chemistry is based
   on this principle. For all of them one is obliged to assume a true
   equality of equation between the principles of the bodies being
   examined and those that are drawn from them through analysis. Thus
   since the must of grapes produces carbonic acid gas and alcohol, I
   can say that grape must = carbonic acid + alcohol. (...) The
   effects of the fermentation of wine are thus reduced to separating
   into two portions the sugar which is an oxide; to oxygenating one
   at the expense of the other to form carbonic acid; and to
   deoxygenating the other in favor of the first to form a
   combustible substance which is alcohol. And all this occurs in
   such a way that if it were possible to recombine these two
   substances, alcohol and carbonic acid, one would reform sugar."

   Chemistry of Gases</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"><BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In 1772, a new field of investigation, the chemistry of gases, was
   opened up to Lavoisier. Succeeding Robert Boyle (1627-1691), John
   Mayow (1645-1679) and Stephen Hales (1677-1761), the British
   chemists Joseph Black (1728-1799), Joseph Priestley (1733-1804)
   and Henry Cavendish (1731-1810) founded pneumatic chemistry during
   the 1760s. The French did not see the importance of the chemical
   role of gases and still considered atmospheric air as an inert
   gas, "a simple receptacle of exhalations."<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In September , Jean Charles Philibert Trudaine de Montigny
   (1733-1777) a high official in t he Ministry of Finances and a
   colleague of Lavoisier at the Academy of Sciences, asked him to
   verify information provided by his spy in London, Jo&acirc;o
   Jacinto de Magalhaens, according to which it was possible to treat
   scurvy by administering to patients a preparation of fixed air
   (CO2 or carbon dioxide) in the form of water impregnated with the
   gas. This, at least, is what the chemist Joseph Priestley had
   reported at the Royal Society.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Fixed air, this newly discovered gas which the British said was
   "fixed" in certain organic compounds, posed an enigma for
   Lavoisier. Was it atmospheric air itself which became fixed,
   Turgot (1727-1781) wrote to Condorcet (1743-1794), or was it only
   a part of atmospheric air? And could this fixation of air be the
   cause of the increase in weight observed when, by simple heating,
   a metal was transformed into its oxide? This operation, called
   calcination by analogy with the method used to transform chalk
   into lime, made it possible to transform numerous metals into
   oxides. But these oxides - it had beeen known for a long time -
   weighed more than the metals that produced them.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Thus the M&eacute;moires de l'Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences had
   taken note in 1667, the year the Academy was created, of the
   Exp&eacute;riences de l'augmentation du poids de certaines
   mati&egrave;res par la calcination ((Experiments Concerning the
   Increase in Weight of Certain Materials Through Calcination). "It
   would be quite natural to believe," the author of the report
   wrote, "that a body cannot become heavier unless it joins itself
   to some perceptible matter. But M. du Clos has shown the Academy
   that a pound of r&eacute;gule of antimony, so finely ground that
   it was reduced to impalpable dust, having been exposed to the
   focus of a burning glass, and reduced to ashes after one hour,
   became heavier by one-tenth, although during all the time it had
   burned, it was giving off a quite thick white smoke. While this
   material was on fire, its surface became covered with a great many
   small whitish filaments. The fire from the charcoal had the same
   effect as that from the sun. When the experiment was repeated, it
   was found that the finer the antimony powder, the more quickly it
   heated and the greater its increase in weight. It was also found
   that sulphurated minerals, such as tin and lead, acquired this
   increase in weight when they were calcined. (...) M. du Clos
   conjectured that the air that is incessantly drawn to places where
   there is fire, deposits on these burning materials full of sulphur
   from the earth more volatile sulphurated particles which join with
   them, become fixed there and form the filaments of which we have
   spoken and which apparently account completely for the increase in
   weight."<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   The only way of finding out was to repeat the experiments done by
   the other authors. Lavoisier chose phosphorus, that astonishing
   body which calcines easily while producing phosphoric acid. Having
   placed in an open flask a half gram of phosphorus, he weighed both
   and placed the flash under a bell jar. With the aid of the burning
   glass he had used to calcine diamonds, he ignited the phosphorus,
   which burned in the flask producing phosphoric acid. At the end of
   the process, the air in the bell jar had diminished by 0.3 liters
   whereas the weight of the flask had increased by 0.3 grams. It was
   clear that the air in the bell jar had been fixed by the
   phosphorus and that this fixation explained the increase in
   weight.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   The same was true with sulfur, which burned under the bell jar,
   transforming itself into sulfuric acid. The weight of the whole -
   bell jar and sulfur - was the same both before and after the
   experiment; that of the bell jar had not changed, only the weight
   of the sulfur had increased. Therefore this increase had
   necessarily been made at the expense of the air contained under
   the bell jar. The calcination of lead and tin gave the same
   results.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Here then was a revolutionary discovery, which was hardly
   compatible with the official theory formulated by Stahl. If the
   simple heating of a metal caused it to lose its phlogiston, it
   should at the same time decrease its weight. But just the contrary
   occurred: its weight increased. Stahl's assertion thus had to be
   false: combustion did not consist of a release of phlogiston but
   in an acquisistion of air and was accompanied by an increase in
   weight.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In November, Lavoisier was ready to establish the chemical role of
   air and to question openly the existence of phlogiston. The
   research program he defined on this theme at the beginning of 1773
   was to be followed scrupulously for the next twenty years. It
   would be punctuated by true discoveries, borrowings from English
   authors and especially brilliant conceptual syntheses which
   provided the bases for modern chemistry.<BR>

   <BR>
   
   Was it - as Turgot argued - the atmospheric air as a whole which
   was acquired during the calcination of metals and came to be
   called fixed air, or only a part of that air? And would that part
   not be precisely the gas that is released by the calcination of
   metallic oxides? In March 1775, Lavoisier carried out his famous
   experiment of twelve days and twelve night on red oxide of mercury
   which is also known as mercurius calcinatus. This oxide obtained
   by prolonged heating of mercury at 350 degrees has the remarkable
   property of spontaneously reducing itself when it is heated to
   more than 400 degrees. Determined to weigh not only the solids and
   liquids, but also the gaseous products of the reaction, Lavoisier
   collected these gases thanks to the pneumatic trough invented by
   Hales and perfected by Cavendish and Priestley.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   The liberated fixed gas that Lavoisier studied had very remarkable
   qualities: it activated combustions and sustained animal
   respiration: it was oxygen. Priestley called it dephlogisticated
   air, but Lavoisier, already a physiologist, preferred called it
   air vital. The theory of acids ensued quite naturally from these
   first discoveries: since by burning sulphur in the fire of oxygen,
   sulphuric acid is obtained and by burning phosphorus, phosphoric
   acid is obtained, the denomination "oxygen" (that which engenders
   acids) `was surely suitable for this new gas. "The definition of
   the composition of air ensues from this program of research:
   atmospheric air is not an element, that is, a simple body, but a
   mixture of several gases. Approximately a quarter of atmospheric
   air is composed by dephologisticated or eminently breathable air
   (oxygen) and three-quarters, of noxious and harmful air
   (nitrogen)." (Lavoisier, </FONT><I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">Oeuvres</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, vol. II, p.
   143.)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In the quarrels over precedence concerning the discovery of
   oxygen, it is thus possible to define Lavoisier's original
   contribution: if the Swede Scheele was the first to isolate it ,
   it was Priestley who defined its properties and Lavoisier who
   identified it as an element. Whether he had wished it or not,
   Lavoisier had been led to the methodical study of Aristotle's four
   elements: could they really be considered as elements, elementary
   constituents of matter? It was no longer true for earth, air and
   fire. What about water?<BR>

   <BR>
   
   In 1783, seeking to identify the product obtained from the
   combustion of hydrogen in the presence of oxygen, Lavoisier
   obtained water - but only after Cavendish and Priestley. Thus
   water as well was not a simple element: it was composed of
   hydrogen and oxygen. But Lavoisier still had to demonstrate this
   in an irrefutable way. Thus in February 1785, he achieved in a
   single experiment the analysis and then, synthesis, of water. His
   demonstration before a large audience lasted three days. With the
   help of J.-B. Meunier de La Place (1754-1793), he passed water
   vapor over incandescent iron, which decomposed it into hydrogen
   and oxygen. The two gases were collected in a separate gasometer
   constructed by M&eacute;gni&eacute; and were then mixed in a glass
   balloon and ignited by an electric spark. Water was
   reconstitued.<BR>

   - The Notion of Element. Lavoisier challenged Aristotle's
   conception of the four elements - earth, water, air and fire - and
   redefined the notion of element. He showed that atmospheric air is
   a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen and that water is a compound
   body, formed from oxygen and hydrogen. He brought to light the
   role of oxygen in combustions, calcinations, oxidations and the
   formation of acids. In asserting with Laplace that the amount of
   heat discharged during a reaction is equal to the amount of heat
   absorbed during the opposite reaction, he formulated the first
   principles of thermochemistry.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   - The Rejection of Phlogiston. By attacking the "sublime theory"
   of Stahl in 1785, Lavoisier in his R&eacute;flexions sur le
   phlogistique, crowned the scientific revolution that was underway.
   But his rights of ownership of this revolution had their limits.
   For the discovery of oxygen, Scheele, the Swede, and Priestley,
   the Englishman, had preceded him. The determination of the
   composition of water was implicit in the results obtained by
   Cavendish, that of heat specific to those of Crawford and Black.
   Moreover, the way he envisaged different degrees of oxygenation is
   scarcely compatible with the modern concept of oxydo-reduction and
   the exchange of electrons which accompanies it: the gain in
   electrons during the reductions goes more in the direction of the
   acquisition of phlogiston, imagined by Stahl.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   -The New Method of Nomenclature. In giving chemistry its first
   general laws, he made it a science; by imposing on it the use of
   the scale and the exact weighing of bodies before and after every
   reaction, he invented an experimental method. But his most
   important contribution was no doubt the modern language he gave it
   by codifying, along with Guyton de Morveau, the new method of
   chemical nomenclature. He did more than simply give it a new
   language: "He formalized this language by taking advantage of the
   quasi-algebraic character and universality of the great linguistic
   functions, according to an open combinatoire, conforming to the
   capacity possessed by chemistry for the rational creation of
   constantly new material spaces." (J.P. Malrieu, </FONT><I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">L'Actualit&eacute; chimique,</FONT></I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva"> 1987, XI.)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In this case, Lavoisier was relying on the Abb&eacute; Condillac
   (1715-1780), whom he quotes in the introduction to the
   Trait&eacute; &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire de chimie: "Languages are
   true analytical methods; algebra, the means of expression which is
   the simplest, most exact and best adapted to its object, is both a
   language and an analytical method. In short, the art of reasoning
   can be reduced to a well constructed language."<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Some people reproached Lavoisier for having replaced Stahl's
   phlogiston theory by its opposite - absorption of oxygen instead
   of the discharge of phlogiston during combustion - and for this
   reason called the new chemistry "anti-phlogiston." Others
   criticized his choice of the new dominations or inisisted that the
   theory of acids was too rigid, since some, such as hydrochloric
   acid, do not contain oxygen. Lavoisier is also sometimes
   reproached for having engaged chemistry and physics in an impasse
   by replacing phlogiston by the hypothetical caloric or
   mati&egrave;re de la chaleur , an imponderable material substance.
   According to Lavoisier, this matter, combined with the oxygen
   principle to form oxygen gas. Between heat-substance and
   heat-movement, the two conceptions coexisting in his times, he
   made the wrong choice. (Maurice Pasdeloup, "Lavoisier g&eacute;ant
   de la science, nain et victime de la politique," in
   Fr&eacute;quence Chimie, November 1994, p. 26.)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   As for chemical affinities, he justified himself by the evasive
   reply that he had not studied them. "M. Geoffroy, M. Gellert, M.
   Bergman, M. Scheele, M. de Morveau, M. Kirwan and many others have
   already collected a multitude of particular facts which are only
   waiting for the places to be assigned to them. But the principal
   data are still lacking, or at least those we possess do not yet
   have enough precision or certainty to become the fundamental base
   on which such an important part of chemistry must stand."
   (Lavoisier, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Trait&eacute;
   &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire de chimie</FONT></I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">, vol. I, p. xiv.)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   It is a good idea to let him speak for himself, since he made the
   point of specifying in 1792, at a time when a certain pride on his
   part was no longer out of place, what he felt to be his personal
   contribution: "One will not deny me, I trust, all the theory of
   oxidation and combustion; the analysis and decomposition of air by
   metals and combustible bodies; the theory of acidification; more
   precise knowledge on the nature of a great number of acids,
   notably vegetable ones; the first ideas on the compositon of
   vegetable and animal substances, and the theory of respiration to
   which Seguin also contributed." (</FONT><I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">M&eacute;moires de Chimie,</FONT></I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva"> vol II, p. 87.)<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In making this dry enumeration with the succinctness of a
   self-assured man, he well knew that he had had to do much more
   than simply reject phlogiston in order to attract the attention of
   the scientific community. His hard work, his experimental method,
   his fortune and costly instruments, his influence at the Academy
   of Sciences, his membership in "enlightened circles," his wife's
   talent for public relations, the Monday dinners at the Arsenal and
   the political role of Paris and France in Europe did the rest.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Lavoisier opened the way for organic chemistry by inventing the
   method of analyzing organic bodies by combustion. It was, however,
   this opening, associated with his concerns for public health,
   which was going to lead him towards medicine, physiology and
   biology.<BR>

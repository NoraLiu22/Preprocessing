Unlike all other living <a href="/arthropoda/chelicerata/cheliceramorpha.html">chelicerates</a>, horseshoe crabs have compound eyes. 
However, the eyes appear smooth because the many subunits of 
the eyes, or <b>ommatidia</b>, are covered by a single thick cornea. There 
are also two simple eyes, or <b>ocelli</b>, in the center of the head.
<P>
Like all chelicerates, Xiphosurans have a body divided into two main 
subdivisions, the <b>prosoma</b> ("head") and 
<b>opisthosoma</b>. Six pairs of legs are present 
on the prosoma (seven in a few fossil species). These legs bear claws 
except for the last pair. The appendages on the opisthosoma are modified 
into a series of overlapping plates that are used as gills for
respiration. Behind the opisthosoma is a <b>telson</b>, which is elongated into
a long spine, and which gives the group its name (<i>xiphos</i> is Greek for
"sword," and <i>uros</i> is Greek for "tail").

and the telson. Notice that each of the two body sections is expanded outward, 
providing a protective armor which shields the legs and gills.

Xiphosurans have existed since the <a href="/silurian/silurian.html">Silurian</a> with relatively little morphological 
change. The main trends in the evolution of the xiphosurans have been an 
overall increase in size, a loss of segmentation on the opisthosoma, 
and a restriction to marine habitats. Whereas all living xiphosurans 
are marine, it seems that some late <a href="/paleozoic/paleozoic.html">Paleozoic</a> and <a href="/mesozoic/mesozoic.html">Mesozoic</a> 
forms inhabited brackish or even fresh water.  Below at right, is a picture 
of <i>Palaeolimulus</i>, a Paleozoic xiphosuran from <a href="/carboniferous/mazon.html">Mazon Creek</a>, Illinois, USA.

The Xiphosura are not a diverse group in the oceans of today. 
One species, <i>Limulus polyphemus</i> (shown above), lives along the Atlantic 
and Gulf coasts of the United States. Three other species in the genera
<a href="tachypleus.gif"><i>Tachypleus</i></a> and <i>Carcinoscorpio</i> 
are found in southern and eastern
Asian waters, from Japan to Indonesia and India. Living horseshoe
crabs feed on <a href="/mollusca/mollusca.html">molluscs</a>, worms, and other tasty and nutritious marine
invertebrates. Normally living at depths of about 100 feet, they
move into shallow water to spawn and lay eggs in beach sand. At
mating season they may be abundant on beaches. In the past,
horseshoe crabs have been harvested in large numbers for fertilizer
and for biomedical research. No living species of horseshoe crab is
endangered yet, but harvesting and habitat destruction have reduced
their numbers at some locations and caused some concern for these
animals' future.

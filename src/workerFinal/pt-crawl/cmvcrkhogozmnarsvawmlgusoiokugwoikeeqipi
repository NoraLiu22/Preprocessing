/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 176]]</font> However much 
          views may vary about man's position in the universe, there can be no 
          difference of opinion as to the place occupied by Dr. Alfred Russel 
          Wallace in the minds and hearts of those who know anything of his work, 
          or have the privilege of personal acquaintance with him. His figure 
          assumes heroic proportions as we contemplate his lifelong devotion to 
          the study of Nature, his epoch-making scientific discoveries, the variety 
          of his interests, his fearless avowal of opinions, however unpopular, 
          and his ardent humanitarianism. Some idea of the many departments of 
          human activity in which he has left his mark may be inferred from the 
          fact that in the index to the new edition of the Encyclop&aelig;dia 
          Britannica there are, under Dr. Wallace's name, no fewer than forty 
          distinct references. Probably he will chiefly be remembered by posterity 
          as the discoverer--simultaneously with Darwin--of the origin of species 
          through the struggle for existence, resulting in the survival of the 
          fittest. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Wallace is essentially a pioneer. The beaten 
          track has no attraction for him; his adventurous spirit and quenchless 
          enthusiasm sometimes carry him into regions that are under the ban of 
          the orthodox scientist. For science, no less than religion, has its 
          orthodoxy, its creed, even its shibboleths, and, without resorting to 
          bell, book, and candle, in a very real way excommunicates the heretic. 
          That Dr. Wallace has not shrunk from incurring the odium scienti&aelig; 
          is one of the reasons of his popularity with the general public. His 
          excursions into the controversial arenas of phrenology, spiritualism, 
          vaccination, socialism, etc., and the candour with which he expresses 
          whatever opinions he forms, testify alike to his open-mindedness and 
          high courage. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his eighty-first year, Dr. Wallace has produced 
          a book that has set all the world talking, and may be destined to eclipse 
          all his previous performances. The fundamental proposition of that startling 
          work is that the known facts about this and other worlds point to the 
          conclusion (1) that the earth is practically at the centre of the stellar 
          universe, and (2) that it alone, among all the heavenly bodies, is inhabited 
          by beings at all analogous to man. It is at once obvious that this momentous 
          theory--which Dr. Wallace supports by an impressive array of facts and 
          arguments--has important bearing on the Christian conception of human 
          life and destiny. If Dr. Wallace's views should come to be accepted, 
          it will not be the first time that science, by a long and circuitous 
          route, has arrived at the same truths as are enunciated in or have been 
          deduced from revelation. 
        </p><p><b>Dr. Wallace at Home.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am singularly fortunate in having been favoured 
          by Dr. Wallace, for the benefit of the readers of <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic">The 
          Christian Commonwealth</font>, with an opportunity of talking with him 
          about his new book and some of the many questions it suggests. Retaining 
          a very vivid and pleasant recollection of a visit I paid to the great 
          scientist six years ago in his Dorsetshire home, I anticipated a second 
          meeting with eager interest. A year ago Dr. and Mrs. Wallace removed 
          from the little cottage near Parkstone Railway Station--in which they 
          had resided for twelve years--to Broadstone, a few miles nearer Wimborne. 
          Here he has built a charming and roomy house on the top of a hill, commanding 
          an extensive and varied view of land and a glimpse of the sea. The natural 
          beauty of the three acres of land, irregular in conformation and diverse 
          in characteristic, in which the new residence stands has been unspoiled 
          by human art, and the veteran scientist is able to enjoy varied walks 
          and other outdoor occupation without going outside the boundaries of 
          his own demesne. As I walked the mile between the oil-lit railway station 
          and &quot;The Old Orchard&quot; on the lovely November afternoon of my visit, 
          the rather strong wind that was blowing made a delicious appeal to every 
          sense, the far-reaching light and darkening shade varied the beauty 
          of earth and sky, and, amid the silence and isolation, one became conscious 
          of the invisible presence and noiseless operation of restful, healthful, 
          healing ministries. Certainly an ideal place for a lover and knower 
          of Nature wherein to spend the evening of his days. 
        </p><p><b>An Outline of His Life.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Wallace has had a tolerably varied experience, 
          geographical and other. Born at Usk, Monmouthshire, on January 8, 1823, 
          he was educated at the Grammar School, Hertford, his mother's native 
          place, to which the family had removed in 1828. His father, who was 
          of Scottish descent, and through relatives at Stirling directly connected, 
          presumptively, with the ancient Wallace clan, died when the future scientist 
          was only eleven years of age.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> From the 
          age of fourteen to twenty-one, A. R. Wallace worked with an elder brother 
          as land surveyor and architect in various parts of England and Wales. 
          His interest in botany dates from the age of seventeen, when he began 
          to form a herbarium. While English master in the Collegiate School at 
          Leicester (1844-5), he made the acquaintance of H. W. Bates,<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 
          through whose influence he became a beetle-collector, and at Mr. Wallace's 
          suggestion the two friends started, in 1848, on an expedition to the 
          Amazon, with the object of collecting natural history specimens and 
          gathering facts &quot;towards solving the problem of the origin of species.&quot; 
          In about a twelvemonth the two naturalists separated, and at the end 
          of a further three years Mr. Wallace returned home, and published &quot;Travels 
          on the Amazon and Rio Negro.&quot; In 1854 he set out alone, and spent eight 
          years in the region between Malacca and New Guinea, the literary result 
          being his deeply interesting &quot;Malay Archipelago.&quot; It was from Ternate, 
          in 1858, that Mr. Wallace sent home, addressed to Darwin, with the request 
          that he would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, a paper setting forth 
          the theory of natural selection. Darwin had been working along the same 
          lines, and on the day on which he received the paper, June 18, wrote 
          to Lyell, &quot;I never saw a more striking coincidence; if Wallace had had 
          my MS. sketch written out in 1842 he could not have made a better short 
          abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On returning from abroad, Dr. Wallace resided in 
          London for a few years. In 1866 he married the eldest daughter of Mr. 
          William Mitten, of Hurstpierpoint, botanist and specialist in mosses. 
          In 1871 he built a house at Grays, Essex, in an old chalk pit, and after 
          living there four years, moved successively to Dorking (two years) and 
          Croydon (three years). Then he built a cottage at the top of Frith Hill, 
          Godalming, and grew nearly a thousand species of plants. In 1886 he 
          went for a nine months' lecturing tour in the United States; on his 
          return, desiring a milder climate, the family settled at Parkstone, 
          three miles west of Bournemouth. Dr. and Mrs. Wallace have a son, who 
          is an electrical engineer, and a daughter, who resides with them. 
        </p><p><b>An Unknown Admirer.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In stature Dr. Wallace is a giant, though scholar's 
          stoop has knocked off the odd inches from the 6 ft. 1&frac12; in., which 
          was his height when a young man. Like most big men, he is very gentle 
          and tender-hearted, as may be surmised from his benignant expression. 
          He is a great favourite with children, and I had the privilege of seeing 
          a charming photograph of a young girl which was sent to him, with the 
          following inscription:--&quot;This little maid conveys greetings for the 
          New Year to the dear and honoured master, Alfred Russel Wallace, from 
          one of his unknown disciples. New Year, 1902.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the sender would reveal his or her identity I 
          am sure the pleasure the token has given the recipient would be much 
          increased. The post-mark was West Kensington. A touch of real, unaffected, 
          healthy boyishness--high spirits, glancing eye, light laugh, zest of 
          life, hearty enjoyment of a good story--adds charm to the manner, and 
          is one of the most fascinating characteristics of this wonderful octogenarian. 
          His incidental confession that when he is reading an interesting tale 
          he does not hurry through it, but likes &quot;to make it last out,&quot; struck 
          me as a delightful self-revelation. His preference is for simple domestic 
          stories thoroughly well worked out, and exceedingly romantic and stirring 
          tales. He does all his own reading and writing. He has worn spectacles 
          for short sight since he was sixteen, but reads without them. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ardent socialist, Dr. Wallace has for many years 
          been a regular reader of the<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic"> Clarion</font>. 
          But he rather regrets Mr. Blatchford's<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
          campaign against Christianity, failing to see the connection between 
          his present proceeding and socialism. &quot;It would almost seem from what 
          he says about fatalism,&quot; Dr. Wallace remarked, &quot;that he believes in 
          some over-ruling power which designed it all.&quot; Dr. Wallace has great 
          admiration for Tolstoy; in fact, he regards him as the greatest of living 
          men. He also paid a tribute to the late Richard A. Proctor. &quot;He was 
          the most broad, imaginative, intellectual astronomer of the age. Until 
          I read his books recently I had no idea he was such a deeply religious 
          man.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Wallace divides his time between gardening, 
          writing letters, articles, and books, and reading modern fiction. One 
          of the first things he did on taking possession of the &quot;Old Orchard&quot; 
          was to make a small pond near the house, which is both ornamental and 
          scientifically useful. In the conservatory adjoining the house he cultivates, 
          among other things, some fine varieties of acacia, raised from seeds 
          presented to him by Sir Thomas Hanbury, and in the aquarium red and 
          blue water-lilies flourish. Thus Dr. Wallace lives a quiet, pleasant, 
          busy, and useful life, giving the world from time to time the fruit 
          of his thought, experiment, and investigation. 
        </p><p><b>The Genesis of &quot;Man's Place in the Universe.&quot;</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of the great naturalist's numerous works has 
          attracted more attention than &quot;Man's Place in the Universe&quot;; indeed, 
          it has created quite a sensation. Until two years ago Dr. Wallace had 
          never seriously thought of the main thesis of the book. When examining 
          the latest results of astronomical research, for the purposes of a new 
          edition of his &quot;Wonderful Century,&quot; he was much impressed by the fact 
          that great astronomers like Sir John Herschel, Professor Newcomb, and 
          Sir Norman Lockyer agreed that our solar system is in the plane of the 
          vast circle formed by the Milky Way, and very nearly in the centre of 
          the ring. That is to say, the long, white, luminous galaxy which is 
          seen at night stretching across the heavens is like a huge cart-wheel, 
          with our little earth near the hub. Another striking fact that set Dr. 
          Wallace thinking is that the most recent researches lead to the conclusion 
          that there are but few stars or nebul&aelig; very far beyond the Milky 
          Way, which suggests the awe-inspiring thought that the human eye, aided 
          by the telescope and photographic plate, has penetrated to the limits 
          of the material universe. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Dr. Wallace was pondering this great subject, 
          Mr. Curtis Brown asked him to write an article for the New York<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic"> 
          Independent,</font> predicting the course of science during the present 
          century. Having a distaste for assuming the role of prophet, Dr. Wallace 
          mentioned the ideas that were occupying his mind. Mr. Brown at once 
          urged him to make them the basis of the article, and, before it was 
          printed, suggested that the author should also write a book upon the 
          subject. Before the article was published Dr. Wallace commenced the 
          book. He began it in February and finished it in July, without having 
          (he told me, in reply to an inquiry) any assistance whatever--no small 
          achievement for a man past eighty. Every word was written with his own 
          hand. His writing, by-the-way, is beautifully legible and firm, and 
          he is both a ready thinker and a facile penman. He never finds it necessary 
          to re-write a book, though he makes corrections, and may write passages, 
          or even important chapters, over again. But he does not put pen to paper 
          until he has accumulated and digested his facts and thought well over 
          his subject. Although written in the comparatively short period of five 
          months, &quot;Man's Place in the Universe&quot; is the result of much study and 
          research. From boyhood the author has been deeply interested in astronomy; 
          he read a great deal of the literature of the science when preparing 
          &quot;The Wonderful Century,&quot; and he mastered its latest developments before 
          issuing his new book. While the work was in progress many volumes passed 
          between &quot;The Old Orchard&quot; and the headquarters of the London Library, 
          the Royal Society, the Linnean Society, and the Astronomical Society. 
          Dr. Wallace has not been in London for three years, and says he hardly 
          expects to come to town again. Old friends occasionally visit him, and 
          he has a very large correspondence. 
        </p><p><font color="990000">[[p. 177]]</font> <b>Critics Answered.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was curious to know how Dr. Wallace regarded the 
          many reviews of his book that have appeared. He has read all that have 
          reached him, and is unperturbed by the worst of them--which distinction, 
          by-the-way, he assigns to that by Mr. C. W. Saleeby, which appeared 
          in the <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic">Academy</font>, under the 
          heading of &quot;Shackled Omnipotence.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is clear,&quot; said Dr. Wallace, &quot;that the majority 
          of the reviewers have not given the time necessary to read the book 
          from beginning to end and impartially weigh the facts. No critic has 
          yet surveyed the whole of the arguments, which are essentially cumulative 
          in their nature and effect. Some of the critics say that the book is 
          the outcome of my preconceptions; but in that they are entirely wrong, 
          for I had no theory at all until indisputable facts seemed to point 
          almost irresistibly to certain conclusions. On the contrary, many of 
          my severest critics are themselves influenced by preconception. Their 
          fixed idea as to what is actual or possible in the universe is the touchstone 
          by which they test my arguments and inferences; whereas I started out 
          with an absolutely open mind. Nor did I have to create the foundation 
          on which my argument is built. I have merely brought together the conclusions 
          of modern astronomers, physicists, chemists, and biologists, and indicated 
          their bearing upon the question of our relation to the visible universe. 
          It is more a matter of weighing evidence than of theorising on the one 
          side or the other. In all scientific inquiry, where absolute certainty 
          is impossible, we incline to that belief for which there is most evidence. 
          Astronomers have not come to any definite conclusion that our solar 
          system is moving in a straight line or in some orbit. My idea is that 
          it is revolving within the circle described by the Milky Way and around 
          the centre of gravity of the solar cluster. But they are tolerably well 
          agreed that our sun is near the centre of the galactic system.&quot; 
        </p><p><b>Are the Stars Inhabited?</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I go on to show that all the probabilities are 
          against life in any such form as we know it here existing on any other 
          planet. Regarded from a purely naturalistic point of view, it is only 
          by the merest chance that man ever came into existence at all on this 
          globe, and the probability of the particular combination of circumstances 
          necessary to produce and sustain the miracle of life obtaining on another 
          planet is so remote as to be practically non-existent. Indeed, we know 
          for a fact that such conditions do not prevail in the bodies, other 
          than the earth, which constitute our solar system, and analogy suggests 
          that they do not exist in any other star or planet.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sir Oliver Lodge appears to share my view as to 
          the uninhabitability of any other planet of the solar system, but he 
          says it is 'absurd' to suppose intelligent beings are not to be found 
          on any other lump of matter in space. But the term 'absurd' is no argument. 
          My critics seem to be afflicted with a sense of the disproportion between 
          the vastness of the universe, on the one hand, and, on the other, our 
          tiny earth and insignificant selves. We must not, however, think only 
          of the beings now on the earth, but of those who have gone before and 
          are coming after--a multitude far more numerous--probably many million 
          times--than the stars of heaven. That may reduce the apparent disparity. 
          But a more important consideration is that as between things which form 
          part of an infinite whole there can be no disproportion, especially 
          if we assume an Infinite Being. Sir Oliver Lodge has himself said that 
          the attempt to explain the universe by chance has absolutely failed. 
          It must have had a designer.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You agree with that?&quot; 
        </p><p><b>A Believer in Design.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Certainly. My whole argument tends in that direction, 
          though my object in writing 'Man's Place in the Universe' was purely 
          scientific, not religious.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I may introduce Dr. Wallace's statement of 
          a fundamental difference between himself and his friend and fellow scientist 
          in regard to the scope of evolution:-- 
        </p><p><b>Wherein Darwin and Wallace Differ.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Darwin believed that the mental, moral, and spiritual 
          nature of man were alike developed from the lower animals, automatically, 
          by the same processes that evolved his physical structure. I maintain, 
          on the other hand, that there are indications of man having received 
          something that he could not have derived from the lower animals.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have you any theory as to how he got that 'something'?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I do not think it is possible to form any idea 
          beyond this, that when man's body was prepared to receive it, there 
          occurred an inbreathing of spirit--call it what you will. I believe 
          this influx took place at three stages in evolution--the change (1) 
          from the inorganic to the organic, (2) from the plant to the animal, 
          (3) from the animal to the soul of man. Evolution seems to me to fail 
          to account for these tremendous transitions.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming back to &quot;Man's Place in the Universe,&quot; I 
          asked Dr. Wallace, assuming the improbability of any other planet containing 
          beings like man, how he regarded the suggestion that some of the stars 
          might be inhabited by quite different orders of existence, possessing 
          characteristics by us inconceivable. 
        </p><p><b>Earth Not the Only Abode of Life.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I need hardly say, I suppose,&quot; replied Dr. Wallace, 
          &quot;that I have never suggested that this earth alone in the whole universe 
          is the abode of life. What I do say is, first, that our system appears 
          to be in or near the centre of the visible universe; and, second, that 
          all the available evidence supports the idea of the extreme unlikelihood 
          of there being on any star or planet revealed by the telescope--I won't 
          say life, but any intelligent being, either identical with or analogous 
          to man. For myself, I confess that I find it difficult to imagine that 
          there can be in the universe, under one supreme Head, a great number 
          of quite differently-formed, but equally intelligent, beings.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless I am very much mistaken, Dr. Wallace inclines 
          to the view that--and thus do Revelation and Science clasp hands--man 
          is made in the image of his Maker, and I do not think he sees anything 
          inherently absurd in the Swedenborgian<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
          idea that the whole universe may total up into the shape of a huge Man-God. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere in his book Dr. Wallace says that there 
          may be in infinite space 
        </p><p><b>Spiritual Universes Inhabited by Spiritual Beings.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought enlightenment on this point. Dr. Wallace 
          responded: 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;To suppose that this one particular type of universe 
          extends over all space is, I consider, to have a low idea of the Creator 
          and His power. That would mean monotony, instead of infinite variety, 
          which is the keynote of things as they are known to us. There may be 
          a million universes, but they may all be different--certainly, I should 
          say, not all matter. We are all agreed that ether is the fundamental, 
          matter being its product; and it is possible that ether may have other 
          products which are not perceptible by us.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then, as a scientist, you have no difficulty in 
          believing in the existence of consciousness apart from material organism?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;None whatever. At the same time, I have a difficulty 
          in conceiving--though there is no reason why it should not exist--pure 
          mind, pure spirit, apart from any substantial envelope or substratum. 
          St. Paul speaks of a 'spiritual body'; that is a body possessed by disembodied 
          spirits. To them it is real enough, but to us it is not corporeal.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You believe also in 
        </p><p><b>The Immortality of the Soul,</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or, at all events, in the persistence of the individual 
          after the dissolution of the body?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I do. The best spiritual teaching seems to me to 
          be that we are all capable of infinite progression, that none are so 
          bad as to be incapable of advancement. I believe that the reason for 
          the existence of this world and the explanation of the problems that 
          puzzle us are that the earth and its struggles and pains are essential 
          to the development of the highest spiritual natures.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, as the conversation proceeded, there was developed 
          the grand and solemn idea of the vast, beautiful, and complicated universe 
          being the theatre designed by the Infinite Creator for the growth and 
          perfecting of the human soul. Verily, science is bringing us back to 
          the fond and by no means irrational beliefs of our childhood! 
        </p><p><b>Dr. Wallace's Religious Views.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am specially interested, as doubtless are most 
          of my readers, in the religious bearings of Dr. Wallace's beliefs and 
          theories. He said he quite expected that &quot;Man's Place in the Universe&quot; 
          would be favourably received by ministers; if it is useful to them he 
          will be pleased, but he disclaims responsibility for any deductions 
          that may be drawn from it in favour of any particular school of theology. 
          He frankly stated that he is quite unable to accept current religious 
          doctrines. This confession enhances the value to the Christian of those 
          of Dr. Wallace's arguments and views that seem to tend to support faith 
          as against scepticism. &quot;The ultimate problems,&quot; he said, &quot;are insoluble 
          and indeed unthinkable. I have no difficulty in conceiving an ascending 
          scale of being rising up into what the Christian means by 'God,' but 
          the idea of a Supreme Being does not, of course, explain the mystery 
          of the universe. The child's questions as to when God began and where 
          He came from still remain unanswered. The fundamental problem is, Why 
          does anything exist at all? Why was there not an absolute negation--nothing 
          but empty space? Infinite time or space or matter alike are unthinkable 
          by us.&quot; I ventured to express the thought that if we were endowed with 
          another sense, or had another convolution added to our brain, these 
          maddening problems, including the being of God, might present no difficulties. 
          But Dr. Wallace shook his head doubtfully. 
        </p><p><b>The Purpose of the Universe.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The only conjecture, theory, or supposition that 
          does seem partially to explain the mystery of the universe is that which 
          I have already mentioned--namely, that the development of souls, of 
          permanent spiritual entities, capable of practically endless advance 
          in knowledge and happiness, is the aim and end of all that we see and 
          know. Some people say, 'What is the good or the need of it all? Why 
          was not man made perfect at once?' All we can say is that, practically, 
          that was not possible. In the only long private conversation I ever 
          had with John Stuart Mill, he argued, 'There cannot be a God, or why 
          did He allow evil--why did He not create man perfect?' I thought the 
          logic very weak and the remark a very superficial one for so great a 
          man. Just think! If man had been created perfect he would have been 
          incapable of progress or advance--in short, he would have been God himself. 
          You cannot conceive any being less than God being perfect. Therefore, 
          all that kind of talk is pointless. The law of the universe seems to 
          be growth by evolution--from the lower to the higher, smaller to greater, 
          worse to better, and so on. That principle may actually govern the action 
          of God Himself. The old idea that God is omnipotent in the sense that 
          He can do anything, even make two and two add up into five, is not a 
          working theory. Limitation, pain, struggle are evidently essential factors 
          in the development of spiritual beings, and if we believe in a Supreme 
          Being with faculties at all similar to those with which He has endowed 
          us, we cannot help also believing that His purpose is the perpetuation 
          of the greatest happiness of the greatest number.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked Dr. Wallace if he could explain how it came 
          about that the sense of God, which, in the case of Darwin, seems to 
          have practically died out, has, in him, grown deeper and stronger as 
          he has grown older.<br />
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Partly,&quot; he replied, &quot;through my contact with modern 
          spiritualism.&quot; 
        </p><p><b>The Religion of the Future.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Do you think that the tendency will be for scientists 
          to become more religious or spiritual?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I do, but the process is a very slow one. The attitude 
          of science was probably never more materialistic than now, unless it 
          was at the end of the eighteenth century. Spiritual scientific men are 
          very few, and most of them are afraid of revealing their mind. The majority 
          of scientists seem to regard it as a sign of insanity to avow belief 
          in any other than what are called the ordinary laws of nature.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But is not science to-day less dogmatic than it 
          was a generation ago, less confident of being able to discover the ultimate 
          secret of things, less disposed to reduce everything to terms of matter?&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I cannot see it. For instance, take the recent 
          correspondence in the <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Italic">Times</font>. 
          When Lord Kelvin and Sir Oliver Lodge expressed their belief in some 
          outside power, some external cause, leading scientific men went dead 
          against them. They seem to think, and to like to think, that the whole 
          phenomena of life will one day be reduced to terms of matter and motion, 
          and that every vegetable, animal, and human product will be explained, 
          and may some day be artificially produced by chemical action.&quot; Even 
          if that were done, Dr. Wallace agreed, behind it all there would still 
          remain an unexplained mystery. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I carried with me from &quot;The Old Orchard&quot; into the 
          dark night increased admiration for the brave and grand old scientist, 
          who in his quiet and beautiful retreat is still studying the wonders 
          of nature and pondering the deep things; a profounder sense of the marvels 
          of the universe; and a strengthened confidence that

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

Nationalisation Society, given at their fifth annual meeting on 29 June 1886, and later printed in

      <p><br /><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="990000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        [[p. 3]]</font> Mr. Wallace began by remarking that there were several 
        indications of the essential principles of Land Nationalisation having 
        made progress in quarters where it had hitherto been received with little 
        favour. He instanced Mr. Jesse Colling's Allotment and Small Holdings 
        Bill, which, he was informed, was now modified so that local authorities 
        were no longer empowered to sell the freehold of land to occupiers, but 
        were in all cases to retain a perpetual ground rent equivalent to about 
        half its nominal value. This may be considered to ensure that the occupier 
        shall always be owner of the tenant-right and pay a rental for the bare 
        land at a low valuation.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bradlaugh's Land 
        Cultivation Bill adopted the principle that the State should take possession 
        of all lands which had been allowed to go out of cultivation, paying the 
        landlords the rental for 25 years as full compensation, and thereafter 
        letting (not selling) the land to working cultivators.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is worthy of note 
        in this connection that under the old Saxon law of England &quot;the mere neglect 
        to cultivate or inhabit the land involved its confiscation to the King's 
        hand,&quot; and that this law was continued during feudal times is shown by 
        the fact stated by Hume in his History of England, &quot;that in the year 1634 
        Sir Anthony Roper was fined £4,000 for depopulation or turning arable 
        land into pasture land, under the provisions of a law enacted in the reign 
        of Henry VIII.&quot; It would be well if some of our legal authorities would 
        ascertain whether this or similar laws cannot be put in force against 
        landlords who are now yearly turning thousands of acres of arable land 
        into pasture, and thus depopulating the country.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="990000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        [[p. 4]]</font> As an instance of the extraordinary carelessness with 
        which people write upon the land question he might mention, that, in last 
        month's issue of the <em>Nineteenth Century</em> there was an article 
        by Lady Verney who quoted a French economic writer, M. Lafargue, as follows, 
        as regards the peasant proprietors of France:-- &quot;There are ten millions 
        of small proprietors in France who, with their families, consume as much 
        as they produce; they eke out a scanty subsistence, and vegetate miserably, 
        condemned by their voluntary isolation to a labour as severe as it is 
        unproductive. The condition of agriculture brought about by our subdivision 
        of the land, and <em>the distance from each other</em> of the <em>morsels</em> 
        belonging to one owner, condemn a man to work such as animals and machines 
        ought to execute; and not only reduces him to the level of a beast, but 
        curses the soil with sterility. . . . <em>Three millions</em> of the small 
        proprietors are on the pauper list of France.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it had never struck 
        Lady Vernon or the editor of the <em>Nineteenth Century</em> that such 
        a state of things was absolutely impossible. Ten millions of proprietors 
        and their families would amount to 37,000,000, the total population of 
        France being 36,900,000! The real number of peasant proprietors was about 
        three millions.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wallace then suggested 
        that what they required in the future would be to get some members of 
        Parliament to put forward preliminary resolutions or motions, or to bring 
        in bills something to this effect. The first should be a resolution that 
        no land the property of the State should be ever sold or permanently alienated. 
        Hitherto the practice had been just the reverse. Secondly, that all manorial 
        rights should become the property of the State, holders being compensated 
        on a fair basis. It would be a comparatively easy and small operation 
        on the basis of the actual net proceeds. Thirdly, that all Crown, State, 
        Municipal, or Corporation lands should be let out in small holdings on 
        our principle--that is, at a quit-rent for the bare land, the tenant to 
        purchase the improvements, and the quit-rent to be revised at long periods. 
        If that was applied to the Crown lands, Municipal lands, and vast Corporation 
        lands, especially in Ireland, it would at once throw open a large area 
        of land on which the experiment of Land Nationalisation could be tried. 
        Fourthly, the total abolition of the Game Laws, which not only create 
        crime, but keep land out of cultivation, and set up a barrier against 
        land reform. He would further suggest that a memorial, or petition, should 
        be got up to the effect that, in any proposal for buying out the Irish 
        landlords, the land should be retained by the State to let out at quit-rents 
        on a permanent tenure. This would lay down the general principle that 
        the State should never alienate the land of the country whenever it has 
        been in any way obtained by the State.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="990000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        [[p. 5]]</font> Mr. Wallace then made some remarks on the mode of compensating 
        landlords by means of terminable annuities, which he had first suggested, 
        and which had been adopted by the Society. He had found by conversation 
        with many intelligent persons not opposed to the principle of Land Nationalisation, 
        that there was a great objection to this method as being opposed to popular 
        ideas of giving full value for the land, and also of giving the landlords 
        a marketable security which it was thought a terminable annuity would 
        not be. His attention had just been called to this subject by reading 
        Mr. Wicksteed's able book, &quot;The Land for the People,&quot; in which that gentleman 
        had suggested a mode of dealing with the landlords more acceptable perhaps 
        to the bulk of the middle and upper classes than the mode their Society 
        had advocated. Mr. Wicksteed proposed that the landlords should be paid 
        in bonds bearing 3 ½ per cent. interest at 30 years' purchase of their 
        ground rents, and he showed very clearly from the past history of the 
        increased value of ground rents in this country that, from their steady 
        increase in value, which there was no reason to believe would stop, these 
        bonds could be bought up and altogether paid off in 40 years, supposing 
        the increase went on as at present, namely, at the rate of two per cent. 
        per annum. That was a point of the greatest importance. If we gave 25 
        years' purchase it would be done still more easily, and if we took a little 
        longer term, say 50 or 60 years, we might get year by year a large decrease 
        of taxation; and you would have what you specially want, viz., the means 
        of showing the people that, though you pay the Landlords the full market 
        value of the land, the result would be that, owing to the continuous increase 
        in the value of the land, they would be able, by paying off these bonds, 
        to extinguish the debt altogether in a comparatively short period--say 
        of two generations--and at the same time year by year reduce taxation, 
        and at last, when the debt was all paid off, the whole of the ground rents 
        would become the property of the State and serve in lieu of taxation altogether. 
        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the report 
        of the last Agricultural Commission he found that considerable pains had 
        been taken to ascertain the real cost of management of great estates and 
        it was stated that it varied from 15 to 20 and sometimes 30 per cent. 
        It was, therefore, not the actual rental of the land the landlords would 
        require to be compensated for, but the net rental, viz.--the rental less 
        this percentage. The State would receive the rents, less say 2 per cent. 
        for collection, and the balance, after paying the landlord's interest, 
        would be clear profit and go to reduce taxation. The system of terminable 
        annuities was always objected to as giving a temporary instead of a permanent 
        security. If by adopting Mr. Wicksteed's plan we could do away with this 
        objection by giving the landlords consols and yet pay them off in 40 or 
        50 years we should get all the benefits of Land Nationalisation even more 
        certainly and quickly than by the present scheme of the Society.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="990000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        [[p. 6]]</font> Note.--The following extracts from Mr. Charles Wicksteed's 
        book, &quot;The Land for the People&quot; (Reeves, 188, Fleet Street, E.C.), will 
        give further information respecting his method of expropriation:--</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;First. Value 
        the ground rental of the country (by ground rental I mean the rent of 
        the land), without buildings or removable improvements.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Second. Compensate 
        the landowners by giving them Government bonds to the amount of 30 times 
        the ground rent, bearing a fixed interest of 3 ½ per cent. per annum, 
        which would be the amount of the ground rent<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> . . . No money 
        would pass, but the owner of the bonds, could, of course, sell them to 
        private individuals, just as he might have been able to sell his land 
        before.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Third. As 
        the land was valued and the bonds were given to the landowners, the land 
        so valued would fall under the control of Land Boards to be created, or 
        of some local body already in existence. These bodies would collect the 
        rents and pay the interest on the bonds through the Imperial exchequer.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fourth. 
        Assuming that the rent would increase, <em>devote any excess over the 
        original amount of interest to the redemption of the bonds</em>.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fifth. As 
        the <em>bonds</em> are paid off, use the <em>interest thus set free</em>, 
        not in redeeming the bonds but in relieving taxation, pp. 8, 9. (Mr. Wicksteed 
        goes on to show that rents, <em>taking town and country together</em>), 
        have always been increasing during the last 300 years, that they have 
        increased with great rapidity during the last fifty years, and must continue 
        to do so while population grows; that they will increase more rapidly 
        than ever if our industries are liberated by the Nationalisation of Land. 
        But assuming the increase of rents during the past 40 years to be the 
        normal one in the future, then the Nation's liability, by his method, 
        will be extinguished in 40 years, an immense reduction of general taxation 
        going on the meanwhile. Assuming, however, that the increase be only <em>half</em> 
        this, still the Nation's liability will cease in 71 years.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        A remarkable coincidence in treatment of the question is shown by an important 
        letter in last week's <em>Statist</em> in which Mr. H. Seymour Trower 
        makes a very similar suggestion as regards Ireland. He says:--</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mr. Giffen 
        takes the judicial rent to be £8,000,000, equivalent, at 20 years' purchase, 
        to a capital of £160,000,000. Why should not the Irish Government, when 
        constituted, create the requisite amount of Irish three per cent. Consols, 
        transfer the stock to the landlords in discharge of all claims, and make 
        the agricultural soil of Ireland national property.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The interest 
        charge on £160,000,000 at 3 per cent. is £4,800,000. A rental of £8,000,000 
        leaves a big margin for redemption by sinking fund. One per cent. or £1,600,000, 
        just half the surplus, would cancel the entire debt in less than fifty 
        years. The debt redeemed, the rents would become a substantial unencumbered 
        addition to the Irish revenue. I adduce Mr. Giffen's figures, without 
        adopting them, merely to show how the scheme would work financially.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For the landlords 
        the terms suggested would be less favourable than those contained in Mr. 
        Gladstone's Land Bill by just the difference in value between English 
        and Irish credit.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The tenure 
        of land in Ireland is based on confiscation in the past. The landowners 
        of to-day, although not responsible for that past, owe their inheritance 
        to it. It is impossible they should altogether escape the Nemesis of wrongs 
        upon which their entire claim for compensation ultimately rests.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Again, our new treasurer, Mr. Soper, in his tract on &quot;Landlordism: What 
        it is; What it does; and what should be done with it,&quot; makes an almost 
        identical proposal by compensating landlords by means of bonds which will 
        give them an income equal to their rentals, <em>less costs of management 
        and losses from bad tenants and bad seasons</em>.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wallace concluded 
        with the following remarks:--</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Here we have a remarkable 
        identity of plans proposed by three original thinkers. It is more in accordance 
        with general public opinion than our plan, it will enlist in its favour 
        a large body of the upper and the commercial classes who have an almost 
        superstitious regard for what they consider to be a permanent and negotiable 
        security; and as we can give them this and retain all the essential advantages 
        of our plan, I certainly think it will be true wisdom and sound policy 
        to adopt it. As the originator of this plan of terminable annuities I 
        may be supposed to look upon it with some parental affection; but the 
        success of Land Nationalization is more to me than any scheme, and as 
        I feel that this success will be ensured by the adoption of State Land 
        Bonds or Consols in lieu of terminable rentals to compensate landlords, 
        I willingly sacrifice my weakly offspring for the public good, and I strongly 
        recommend the Society to make this alteration in its programme.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wallace then announced 
        his proposed lecture tour to America and Australia, which would necessitate 
        his absence at the next Annual Meeting--a matter of little importance 
        to the Society, as there were several talented Vice-Presidents who would 
        worthily occupy his place.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br /><em>Notes Appearing in the Original Work</em></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a name="1" id="1"></a>1. The statements as to these laws 
        are taken from a pamphlet, &quot;Land Lessons, Irish Parliaments, and Constitutional 
        Criticisms,&quot; by Clio. James Duffy &amp; Sons, 1, Paternoster Row. <font color="990000">[[on 
        p. 3]]</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a name="2" id="2"></a>2. Average 3.71 to a household--37 millions proprietors--rather more than <em>total Population</em>!! Total
population, <em>36,900,000</em>. The actual peasant-proprietors of France are about 2 ½ <em>millions</em>, and this is
perhaps an over-estimate, because those having land in different communes will often be counted twice.
<font color="990000">[[on p. 4]]</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a name="3" id="3"></a>3. For the re-assurance of those who may regard these terms as too liberal to the landholders, Mr.
Wicksteed stated at the Society's General Meeting that he by no means bound himself to the proportions
here indicated. These marked the limits of national generosity. Any reduction in these terms would, of
course, hasten the process of Land Nationalisation. <font color="990000">[[on p. 6]]</font></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Many iguana 
        keepers come to appreciate the benefits of tubbing their iguanas. Not 
        only do most tubbed iguanas prefer to potty in the tub (making it very 
        easy for their keepers to clean up after them and disinfect the surfaces), 
        but the daily immersion helps improve the iguana's overall hydration status, 
        a critical factor in kidney health. Baths also help during shedding, keeping 
        the loosening skin soft and pliable, ensuring its easy separation.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">The fight 
        that many iguanas put up when first introduced to the bathtub leads many 
        iguana keepers to assume that iguanas are afraid of the water. The fact 
        of the matter seems to be that captive iguanas are afraid of the bathtub, 
        whether or not it has water. Some do fine in the empty bathtub, but freak 
        out when you start to run water.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">In the 
        wild, green iguanas live near rivers, streams and lakes. Swimming, diving, 
        and floating are commonly observed activities. In fact, some iguanas have 
        to swim within days of hatching. The hatchlings who emerge from their 
        nests on Slothia, an islet off the coast of Barro Colorado Island in Panama, 
        have to swim across the inlet (82 yards/75 meters) to make it to the main 
        island where they will spend their lives, with the exception of the females 
        who will once again swim across the inlet to the Slothia to lay their 
        eggs. Others swim still farther, taking longer routes to Barro Colorado 
        or to more distant neighboring islands.</font> </p>
      <p align=left>So, <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">what 
        makes your bathtub so different from the lakes, streams and rivers? Aside 
        from the lack of lush tropical vegetation, colorful birds, mammals, other 
        animals, insects, and the occasional caiman? It sounds and feels a whole 
        lot different. The slick, bright tub surface and the loud echoing noise 
        of the water rushing from the faucet are a far cry from even a swiftly 
        moving river surrounded by a cacophony of animal calls. It probably doesn't 
        help that you are standing up over the iguana, staring down at him.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Fortunately, 
        iguanas can and do get used to baths, many coming to demand them by climbing 
        into the tubs on their own, scratching and pulling in objects from the 
        rim if you don't get in there fast enough to run the water for them. The 
        length of time it takes for an iguana to get used to baths varies with 
        individual iguanas, but it may take a month or more or steeling your heart 
        and nerve and making him stay in the tub until he poops or has spent at 
        least 20-30 minutes in there.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><b>Bathtub 
        Tips<br>
        </b></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Just as you 
        probably abhor a cold bath, so does your iguana. The water should be warm 
        enough to not allow his body temperature to drop too rapidly from the 
        time he is taken from his basking or other warm area and put in the water. 
        Water that is 83-85 F (28-29 C) is suitable for iguanas; over time you 
        may find that your iguana prefers it a bit warmer or cooler. The longer 
        your iguana bathes, the cooler the water will get. If your iguana is partial 
        to long baths, or he hasn't pooped yet, you will need to let some of the 
        cooled water out and refresh the tub with warm water. Repeat this as often 
        as necessary to keep the bath &#150; and bathroom &#150; warm.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">If you run the water 
        into the tub after the iguana has been placed in there (suggested only 
        if your iguana likes the bath and won't leap straight up in the air and 
        attach himself to your face with his claws when you turn the water on), 
        make sure he is far enough away from the incoming stream of water for 
        you to be able to get the temperature adjusted before it reaches him. 
        Most iguanas don't like being startled with very hot or very cold water. 
        If you see their tail jerk and quiver, test the water with your hand &#150; 
        it may be too hot.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Generally speaking, 
        there is no reason to add anything to the water &#150; no soap, disinfectants, 
        etc. If your iguana has wounds or incisions, or is being treated for mites, 
        then you can add some Betadine (povidone-iodine) to the bath water once 
        your iguana has had an opportunity to drink.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">If your iguana poops 
        in the water but still wants to soak, you will need to drain out the tub 
        (some people use a cup or scoop to pull the feces and urates from the 
        tub to dispose of it down the toilet rather than let them go down the 
        tub drain), rinse it thoroughly, and refill it. If there are any concerns 
        about zoonotic infection, the tub should be disinfected before the replacement 
        bath is run. This can be problematical: what do you do with the iguana 
        for the minimum 10 minutes it takes to disinfect surfaces? Leaving him 
        in an empty tub (empty but for the sprayed-on disinfectant, assuming you 
        are using the iguana-safe disinfectants Nolvasan or Hibiclens [chlorhexidine 
        diacetate or chlorhexidine gluconate, respectively]) is going to result 
        in a cold, possibly ticked-off iguana. Because these chlorhexidine disinfectants 
        (not bleach-water solutions, quaternary ammonia compounds, or similar 
        disinfectants) are safe to use to flush wounds, including flushing the 
        mouth when treating for stomatitis, one could spray down the tub, gently 
        moving the iguana to one side to reach all surfaces, let it sit for a 
        few moments, and then run the fresh water in, leaving the chlorhexidine 
        in the tub. It will be doubly diluted (the dilution you first made in 
        the spray bottle, typically 4-6 tablespoons of Nolvasan per gallon of 
        water, which is further diluted by the bath water) and below the 1% concentration 
        recommended as a wound irrigation solution.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">The slippery surface 
        of the tub is a problem for many iguanas. This can be easily dealt with 
        by putting self-adhesive safety decals (as used for children and frail 
        elderly) on the tub's bottom. Decals can be tricky as they can trap fecal 
        material, so you will need to go over and around them with a sponge when 
        cleaning and disinfecting the tub after the iguana's bath. Another way 
        to deal with the slippery surface is to put a towel on the bottom, either 
        laying it flat, crumpling it up, or rolling it up like a log. The only 
        problem with this is that, after the bath is over, you are left with a 
        soaking wet, possibly poopy towel that has to be wrung out and transferred 
        to the washing machine for washing with laundry soap and bleach (to disinfect). 
        Fortunately, the majority of iguanas get used to the surface and stop 
        thrashing about like you and the tub are trying to kill them. The best 
        thing, if you have to use something, is a rubber bath mat. Not only does 
        it give the iguana something to stand on, it has the added advantage that 
        it doesn't permanently mar the tub, and can be left in the tub for cleaning 
        and disinfecting.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">If you have a tub/shower 
        enclosure with sliding doors mounted on the rim of the tub, adult green 
        iguanas can easily jump up and latch a claw or two over the door track 
        and haul themselves up. This is useful for them getting in and out of 
        the tub on their own. Unless, of course, you don't want them getting out 
        of the tub at that particular time. If that is the case, keep the doors 
        closed far enough so that they cannot get out, leaving a gap through which 
        you can easily observe them. If you have a tub with a shower curtain, 
        they may not so easily be able to get in and out, unless they figure out 
        that they can get a boost by getting a hind foot on the drain lever or 
        faucet. In this case, it is best to keep the shower curtain in the tub, 
        leaving a gap at the end away from the faucet and drain for observation.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">To help iguanas get 
        in and/or out themselves, you can attach Velcro strips to the inside and 
        outside of the side of the tub, an inch or so below the edge. Put Velcro 
        on some washcloths, attach them to the strips when needed, and your iguana 
        now has something to grab onto to haul himself up. Other things that work 
        are rubber bath mats draped over the edge, or a rubber-backed bathroom 
        rug. For smaller iguanas, there is a product sold in kitchenware shops 
        or aisles in supermarkets: a rolled-up sheet of rubbery mesh made to lay 
        on kitchen shelving to allow glasses and plates to drain while making 
        it less likely that they will topple over or slide into one another. Draped 
        over the edge of the tub, like the bath mat or rug, small iguanas can 
        easily climb it to get in and out. It is easier to clean and disinfect 
        than a bathroom rug, assuming your iguana decides to do a little poop-painting.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">If your tub doesn't 
        have a stopper, or your only option is a shower stall, you can get flat 
        rubber disks in the kitchenware aisle of the supermarket or hardware store, 
        used to block up the kitchen sink drain. They work equally well to stop 
        up a bathtub or shower drain. The drawback to this is that you have to 
        stick your hand in poopy water to remove it from the drain so the water 
        can drain out. Disposable gloves, or latex gloves that you can easily 
        clean and disinfect, can be used for this purpose.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">When your iguana is 
        small, you may be lucky enough to see him swim in the tub. Very, very 
        cool to watch. They lay their arms against their sides, while their legs 
        may be against their tail or bent out a bit away from the body. Their 
        tail does all the work, propelling them through the water, while they 
        steer themselves by bending from side to side at the equivalent of their 
        waist. If you've ever seen film or video of a crocodilian swimming, you 
        will have a good idea of what your iguana's swimming technique will be.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Iguanas large and small 
        are quite capable of diving under water and staying there, completely 
        freaking their keepers out. While submerged, they do not breathe. Because 
        of their complete stillness and the lack of bellows movement normally 
        seen as they breathe in and out, they look dead. While iguanas can drown, 
        they can also hold their breath for 30 minutes or so. Their heart pumps 
        blood and circulates oxygen throughout the body differently than ours 
        does, and their body is capable of accessing more of the oxygen in their 
        blood. (Reptiles in general are so unique in this area that the blood 
        factors of certain species, and equipment modeled on other species' circulatory 
        systems, are being used in human medicine to get patients more safely 
        through prolonged surgical procedures.) This means that while they are 
        snoozing underwater, they will not asphyxiate from lack of oxygen unless 
        they exhaust their body's supply. If you touch them, you may startle them 
        awake and send them to the surface. This won't harm them, though it is 
        likely to earn you a splashing and a dose of Stink Eye.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Once your iguana is 
        done with his bath, you can pick him up in a towel to transfer him back 
        to his enclosure or area. You needn't dry him off, but the towel will 
        help soak of the worst of the drips so you don't leave a trail through 
        your house. If your iguana gets out of the tub by himself, you might want 
        to put some bathroom rugs or bath towels down on the floor leading from 
        the tub to the bathroom doorway so that the drips are pretty much dropped 
        by the time he crosses the threshold.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><b>Swimming 
        in the BIG Tub<br>
        </b></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">As discussed 
        above, iguanas live near water and are not adverse to using the rivers, 
        streams and lakes as aids to relocation. Flopping in from branches overhanging 
        the water, or walking down or jumping in from the bank, iguanas can swim 
        or float their way to a new location. As there are various large snakes, 
        crocodilians and raptors who may be hanging around waiting for an alfresco 
        iguana dinner, iguanas include diving and swimming underwater to their 
        aquatic repertoire. While your swimming pool may be less picturesque than 
        what a wild iguana is used to, and may be less fraught with dangers of 
        the wild kind, it may well be inviting to your iguana. You need to be 
        smart about letting your iguana swim, however, as there are dangers of 
        another sort that lurk in and around the pool.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">If the water quality 
        of a swimming pool is safe for a human to swim in, it will be safe for 
        an iguana. This means that if the pool has been freshly treated and humans 
        are to stay out of it for 24 hours, so too should iguanas. If your iguana 
        has shown any sensitivity to pool chemicals (see the articles on <a href="../reptileallergies.html">Reptile 
        Allergies</a> and <a href="../resources/plants.html">Harmful and Edible 
        Plants</a> for symptoms of toxic or irritant contact and ingestion), it 
        will be best to stick to the bath tub.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Iguanas may swim leisurely 
        in the water, but that doesn't mean they are not capable of sustained 
        bursts of speed. Combined with the ability of many iguanas to launch themselves 
        out of the pool and hit the deck running, it is not a good idea to let 
        your iguana in the pool while you are by yourself. Better for you and 
        your iguana to have at least one other person on the other side of the 
        pool, ready to do a mid-air snatch or ground tackle to get the iguana 
        before he is up the nearest tree and over the fence.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">The more visible humans 
        are around the pool, the less likely a predacious bird is to spend flying 
        overhead checking things out. This is going to make your iguana feel better, 
        as their parietal eye is there in part to watch for overhead predators. 
        Fewer predators means less of a reason to go launching out of the pool 
        or diving for the drain at the deep end. If your iguana isn't used to 
        dogs, letting your dog or someone else's cavort around the pool edge isn't 
        a good idea, as it may send the iguana into the same flight or dive response 
        as will an aerial predator.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">As mentioned in the 
        Bath section above, iguanas, like many reptiles, can hold heir breath 
        for a half hour or so, efficiently making use of the oxygen in their bloodstream. 
        The problem is in surfacing again if in the meantime the iguana has gotten 
        too cold. If the iguana is at the bottom of the pool and is too cold and 
        sluggish, he will not be able to surface when he needs to...so be prepared 
        to do a little diving and breath-holding yourself! And yes, you can do 
        CPR on lizards: depending on the size, use your thumb or finger tips to 
        do the chest compressions, and administer breaths by cupping your mouth 
        over their nose and mouth, expelling your breath into their nostrils. 
        Remember that your lizard has lungs far smaller than yours so do not force 
        in all your breath into him. Keep one hand on his chest to feel it expand; 
        keep the other around his upper and lower jaw to prevent him from biting 
        your lips should he come out of it quicker than you thought he would.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">If you share your pool 
        with others, please be concerned about them. Not everyone likes iguanas, 
        and some may object strenuously to having them in their pool. A sad attitude, 
        and their loss, but if you are a renter or even a condominium owner in 
        a complex with a common area, be a considerate reptile owner and respect 
        other people's fears and issues.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Another potential problem 
        is that of cleanliness. If you don't poop your iguana before letting him 
        in the swimming pool, you can't be surprised if he does what comes naturally 
        in there. Believe me when I say that cleaning poop out of a swimming pool 
        is not the same as cleaning and disinfecting a bathtub...especially when 
        others may be watching who are not as understanding and knowledgeable 
        as your own family and who may have legitimate concerns about <i>Salmonella</i>. 
        Of course, if the bystanders are your less-than-understanding family, 
        you will have to deal with their Stink Eye, too.</font></p>

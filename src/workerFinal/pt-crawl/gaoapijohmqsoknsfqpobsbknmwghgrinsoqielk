<P>by <A HREF="contributors.html#kuo">Michael Kuo</A></P>

<P><I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I>, like its cousin, <A HREF="http://mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Boletopsis_grisea.html" TARGET="new"><I>Boletopsis grisea</I></A>, is confusing. It looks like a tough-fleshed <A HREF="boletes.html">bolete</A>--or, then again, maybe it looks like a soft-fleshed <A HREF="polyporales.html">polypore</A>. And now, DNA studies tell us it is closely related to <A HREF="toothed.html">toothed mushrooms</A> like <A HREF="sarcodon_imbricatus.html"><I>Sarcodon imbricatus</I></A>. Add to this confusion the centuries-long debate about where the species lines should be drawn in <I>Boletopsis</I> and, well, you may not want to go there.</P>

<P>If you're bound and determined, however, the first thing you will need to figure out in order to identify your <I>Boletopsis</I> is the kind of tree (spruce or pine) it was associated with, since <A HREF="glossary.html#mycorrhizal">mycorrhizal association</A> appears to be the most stable identifying feature in the genus. Generally speaking, the pine-associated gray species corresponds with <I>Boletopsis grisea</I>, and the spruce-associated gray species corresponds with <I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I>--and the "<I>Boletopsis subsquamosa</I>" in your field guide probably represents a combination of these two species (see the discussion below for more details). However, it appears there may be as-yet unnamed, poorly documented species in North America awaiting further documentation and study (again, see the discussion below), so don't guarantee your <I>Boletopsis</I> identification to your neighbors and family.</P>

<!--<P>Actually, you know what? Belay that last. Go right ahead and make the guarantee, because I really want to see you step out onto the front porch, hold your <I>Boletopsis</I> aloft, and scream to the neighbors: "I, Darren, guarantee this to be <I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I>." I know; your name is probably not Darren. But that's what I'm calling you in my head right now, and . . . </P>

<P>Anyway. --><P>In terms of physical features, there is not a lot separating <I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I> from <I>Boletopsis grisea</I>. The former is usually taller and skinnier, with the stem length at maturity exceding the width of the cap, while the latter species is usually about like a <A HREF="russula.html"><I>Russula</I></A> in stature, with the stem's height about equal to the cap's width. <I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I> is generally a darker shade of gray, and has softer flesh--and under the microscope the hyphae that comprise the surface of the cap are swollen at their ends, in pear-shaped terminal cells, while the corresponding hyphae in <I>Boletopsis grisea</I> are only slightly swollen, in sub-terminal cells. Unfortunately, more easily assessed microscopic features (spore dimensions, for example) are not informative.</P>

<P>"<I>Boletopsis subsquamosa</I>," according to Donk (1969) and according to Niemel&#228; & Saarenoksa (1989), is a name that has been misapplied for centuries, since the earliest detailed descriptions of the species match what is now known as <A HREF="albatrellus_ovinus.html"><I>Albatrellus ovinus</I></A> better than any species of <I>Boletopsis</I>. In many North American sources (e.g. Gilbertson & Ryvarden, 1986), the name <I>subsquamosa</I> has been used to encompass both <I>grisea</I> and <I>leucomelaena</I>.</P>

<P>A recent <I>Boletopsis</I> paper by Watling and Milne (<A HREF="https://www.pnwfungi.org/index.php/pnwfungi/article/download/1060/697" TARGET="new">2008</A>) studied six relatively poorly documented North American <I>Boletopsis</I> collections (none of which appears to have been made by the authors), and compared their ITS sequences with well-documented European collections of <I>Boletopsis grisea</I>, <I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I>, and a recently described Scottish species, <I>Boletopsis perplexa</I>. Among the six North American collections, none was found to match <I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I>; four matched <I>Boletopsis grisea</I>; one matched <I>Boletopsis perplexa</I>, and one matched none of the European species and may represent a new species. Ecological data was entirely missing for three of the six collections studied. According to the study:</P>

<UL>It was found that the North American collections could be separated into two taxa. <I>Boletopsis grisea</I>, as previously reported for material from both Eastern and Western States of North America; and a second taxon, <I>B. perplexa</I>, a newly recognized species from the British Isles, and not European B. <I>leucomlaena</I>, as the literature would suggest.</UL>

<P>However, there is a serious error in logic involved with this statement. Yes, "the literature" in North America suggests the presence of <I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I>--but it does <I>not</I> suggest that any random study of six poorly documented specimens from a continent 2500 miles wide, none of which was noted to occur under spruce, will fail to turn up a phylogenetic match with <I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I>--a species the authors agree is exclusively associated with spruce. Only a thorough study of <I>many</I> well-documented collections, <I>including</I> ones noted by collectors to have occurred under spruce, could approach a conclusion about whether <I>Boletopsis leucomelaena</I> occurs in North America. Are you an enterprising mycology graduate student in need of a thesis project? This could be your ticket to fame and fortune!</P>

<P><B>Description:</B></P>

<P>Ecology: <A HREF="glossary.html#mycorrhizal">Mycorrhizal</A> with spruces; growing alone, scattered, or gregariously; summer and fall; North American distribution uncertain, but possibly to be expected wherever spruces occur naturally. The illustrated and described collection is from a spruce forest in Colorado.</P>

<P>Cap: 5-8 cm across; convex becoming planoconvex; dry; fairly bald; gray to dark gray or nearly black; sometimes somewhat mottled or streaked in appearance.</P>

<P>Pore Surface: Running down the stem; creamy white, becoming slightly brownish with age; bruising slowly pinkish, then brownish; pores angular, 2-3 per mm; tubes 1-2 mm deep.</P>

<P>Stem: 3-5 cm long; 1.5-2.5 cm thick; bald or, in age, finely scaly; colored like the cap, except at the whitish apex; tough; sometimes with orangish fuzz at the base.</P>

<P>Flesh: Whitish; staining pinkish gray to lilac gray when sliced, especially near the cap margin.</P>

<P><A HREF="odortaste.html">Odor and Taste</A>: Odor not distinctive; taste not distinctive, or slightly bitter.</P>

<P><A HREF="macrochemicals.html">Chemical Reactions</A>: KOH on cap surface black.</P>

<P><A HREF="spore_print.html">Spore Print</A>: Pale yellowish brown.</P>

<P><A HREF="microscope.html">Microscopic Features</A>: Spores 4-5 x 3-4 &#181;; angular and irregular in outline; nodulose; yellowish in KOH. Hyphal system monomitic. Pileipellis composed of tangled and interwoven, clamped hyphae 2.5-7.5 &#181; wide, brownish to hyaline in KOH, with infrequent swollen, pyriform terminal cells.</P>

      <p><strong>Gentle reader:</strong> Theatre is an art of the &quot;now,&quot; and most of its practitioners
      (both in the past and the present) have rarely given much thought to history.
      Documentation of early theatre in New York City is sketchy, and respected sources 
      often differ on specifics. Research keeps turning up new information, so
      although the paragraphs that follow are based on the best available material, time will almost
      certainly reveal new information not available as of this writing.</p>
      
      <h3><a name="Crude">Crude</a> Beginnings</h3>
      <p>The first Dutch colonists settled Lower Manhattan in 1624. Displacing the
      native Lenape tribe, the Europeans called their crude trading post 
      &quot;New Amsterdam.&quot; The staunchly 
      Protestant Dutch had no taste for theatre, and even though the British
      forcibly took over in 1664 -- and promptly renamed the colony New York --
      more than a century would pass before the 
      town saw its first professional stage production. While Britain had a rich
      theatrical tradition, the cultural spirit of New York was still opposed to
      such entertainment.</p>
      
      <p>Through the early 1700s, New York's primary form of leisure was consuming
      alcoholic beverages. With pure water hard to come by, booze was a necessity. The
      fashionable classes eventually found an alternative when a coffee house called <strong>The
      King's Arms</strong> opened in 1696 (on Broadway just south of Trinity Church).
      Some scholars theorize that The Kings Arms may have housed Manhattan's earliest 
      theatrical performances. If so, they would have been makeshift 
      amateur events. No written record of such performances is known to
      survive.</p>
      
      <p>In September of 1732, a troupe of actors from London presented a repertory 
      of plays (we are not certain which titles) on the unoccupied second floor of 
      a building near the intersection of Maiden Lane and Pearl Street. It was just 
      an empty space, not a formal theatre. Records tell
      us the room was large enough to hold about four hundred people, with raised
      seats overlooking a stage platform. The earliest documented professional
      performance of a specific play in New York City occurred on Dec. 6, 1732, when this
      same troupe offered a comedy entitled <em>The Recruiting Officer</em>. Performances 
      continued in this space (which at least one newspaper ad referred to as &quot;The
      Playhouse&quot;) through the end of the decade. Over time, it is believed
      that other troupes used improvised performance spaces in Manhattan, but no 
      records of their repertories are known to survive.</p>

      alt="Location of the Nassau Theatre 2004" width="71" height="101" /></a><span><strong>The
      location of the Theatre on Nassau Street as it appeared in 2004 -- a
      brick office building dwarfed by skyscraping neighbors.</strong></span></p>
      
      <p> By 1750, New York had over ten thousand 
      citizens, more than 150 taverns -- and (finally!) one formal performance space.
      Sitting slightly East of Broadway, the 
      <strong><a href="bwaypast4.htm#Nassau">Theatre on Nassau Street</a></strong>      
      was a two story wooden structure that held about 280 people.
      Actor-managers <strong>Walter Murray</strong> and <strong> Thomas 
      Kean</strong> set up a resident company that presented Shakespeare's 
      <em>Richard III </em> on March 5, 1750. Their repertory also included the first 
      documented performance of a musical in New York -- <strong>John Gay's 
      <em>The Beggars Opera</em></strong>, which they offered on Dec. 3, 1750.</p>
      
      <p>Little documentation exists describing the Theatre on Nassau, so 
      historians have had to resort to guesswork, 
      suggesting that this building &#150;</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p><span>. . . may have been either a warehouse or a
        brewery (or both). . . probably fitted up with a stage at one end,
        benches in front of it, and a raised gallery at the rear for common
        folk. Murray and Kean made a significant addition to their New York
        playhouse &#150; they added boxes along the side walls, not only to increase
        the seating (a sign that they attained a moderate success) but also to
        provide a special place for the elite of the city.</span><br />
        <strong>- Mary C. Henderson, <em>Theater in America: 200 Years of Plays,
        Players and Productions</em> </strong>(New York: Harry Abrams, Inc., 1986), p.
        237.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Eventually, 
      the building was taken over by an adjoining business and turned into storage 
      space. Another company played on the same block of Nassau Street in 1753,
      but records are unclear as to whether this was in the old theatre space or
      a new structure. In 1754, the theatre was torn down to make way for a
      church</p>

      alt="Location of the John Street Theatre in 2004" width="65" height="105" /></a><span><strong>A
      four-story office structure now stands where the Theatre on John Street
      was located in the late 1700s.</strong></span></p>
      
      <p>Just around the corner from that location, the 
      <a href="bwaypast3b.htm#JohnSt"><strong>Theatre on John Street</strong></a> 
      opened on Dec. 7, 1767 with a performance of George Farquhar's comedy
      <em>The Beaux' Strategem</em>. A period illustration currently in the Harvard
      Library collection depicts this theatre as all-wooden 
      structure that looked very much like a storehouse, but we
      have no solid information on its seating capacity or interior appearance.
      It was home to a repertory company run by actor-managers <strong> Lewis Hallam</strong> 
      and <strong>John Henry</strong> who remained in charge during all but the final year of this 
      theatre's existence, 1798.</p>
      
      <p>Records indicate that there were no professional stage productions in New York 
      during the Revolutionary War years -- only amateur performances staged by some 
      of the British troops occupying the city. After the war, New York became the 
      nation's capital for a time, and <strong>George Washington</strong> is known to have attended
      several performances at the John Street Theatre. Years later, that same theatre 
      hosted <strong><em>The Archers</em> (1796)</strong>, a native-born opera that some scholars 
      point to as arguably the earliest American musical.</p>
      
      <h3>The <a name="Park"> Park</a> Theatre</h3>
      <p><a href="images/parkint.jpg"><img src="images/parkint_small.jpg" 
      alt="Interior of the Park Theatre" width="100" height="56" /></a><span><strong>A period print depicting the
      interior of The Park Theatre, New York City's premiere performance space
      in the early 19th Century.</strong></span></p>
      
      <p>At the end of the 18th Century, New Yorkers started to exhibit a
      clear passion for theatre, and actor-managers Hallam and Hodgkinson
      responded by building the city's first world-class performance space. 
      The <a href="bwaypast5.htm#Park"><strong>Park Theatre</strong></a>, built in
      1798 on Chatham Street (now called Park Row),
      housed few musicals in its fifty year existence. With a spacious
      bench-filled pit, four tiers of private boxes, and a top gallery, this handsome stone 
      structure could hold up to 2,000 spectators. This theatre helped to make the 
      area around what is now City Hall Park one of the most fashionable
      districts in the city. The Park attracted a wide 
      ranging audience -- each class sitting in its preferred section. In the 
      quote below, &quot;mechanics&quot; refers to working class men:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
      <p><span>All kinds of performances were housed under one
      roof, so that audiences in the 1830s might see drama, circus, opera and
      dance on the same bill. New York's Park Theater, despite a reputation as
      an elite house, had a relatively large room that permitted the masses to
      govern the stage. Each class had its own part of the theatre, but all
      attended &#150; mechanics in the pit, upper classes and women in the boxes,
      and prostitutes, lower class men, and blacks in the balcony. The rowdy
      audiences often yelled, stamped, drank and smoked during 
      the performance.</span><br />
      <strong>- Lewis A. Erenberg, <em>Steppin' Out: New York Nightlife and the
      Transformation of American Culture 1890-1930</em> (Chicago: University of
      Chicago Press, 1981), p. 15.</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>Admission was 50 cents for the pit, 25 cents for the gallery, and a
      full dollar for the boxes. The overall din of a rowdy audience often
      drowned out the action on stage. Most of it came from the &quot;gallery gods&quot;
      in the uppermost tier, who considered it their social duty to proclaim their 
      feelings. Showers of fruits and nuts (and sometimes worse) from the upper 
      reaches were common. Prostitutes openly transacted business in
      the balcony, which only added fuel to the fiery sermons of preachers
      convinced that theatres were &quot;foyers of hell.&quot;</p>
    
      <p>When <strong>Stephen Price</strong> took over as manager of the Park in 1808, he
      initiated a policy of importing and promoting renowned British actors --
      America's first taste of a &quot;star system.&quot; Any degree of success in 
      London almost guaranteed sell out houses in
      the United States. Price used his British contacts to create a virtual
      monopoly on imported talent, and every theatre
      in America had to negotiate with him to book imported stars.</p>
    
      <h3><a name="Sex">Sex</a> in the Balcony</h3>
      <p>It may seem hard to believe today but theatres were once hot
      beds of illicit sexual activity -- not onstage, but in the audience. 
      This had long been the case in Europe,
      and this lamentable custom carried over to 19th Century New York City. 
      It was widely known that theatre owners allowed
      prostitutes to ply their trade in the top balcony, where such
      carryings on were least likely to disrupt the performances. New York's
      corrupt and understaffed police force offered no objections. According to 
      historian Timothy J. Gilfoyle in his fascinating study <em>City of Eros</em> 
      (NY: Norton &amp; Co., 1992) --</p>
        
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Leading establishments like the Bowery,
        Chatham, Olympic, and Park theatres permitted prostitution in the
        uppermost tier of seats. 'Public prostitution [in the theater] is not
        noticed by law,' admitted one observer. First-time middle-class
        visitors incredulously conceded that they 'had not even dreamed of the
        improprieties then publicly tolerated in the third tier and galleries.'
        &quot; (p. 67)</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Through the mid-1800s, theatrical prostitution remained an accepted
      feature of the so-called &quot;sporting life&quot; common to men of that time, 
      whether single or married. Since the top gallery was also the only place
      where young boys could afford seats, it is easy to see
      why preachers and newspaper editorials condemned theatre as a
      sinful influence on all age groups.</p>

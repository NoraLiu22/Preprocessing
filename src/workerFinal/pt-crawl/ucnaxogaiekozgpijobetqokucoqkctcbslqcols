<strong>Do We Use Only 10% of Our Brains?</strong> </p>

<div id="ctr"> <div id="hd"> <h1> Neuroscience For Kids </h1> </div>

<div id="mn"> <h2> Do We Use Only 10% of Our Brains?</h2>
<p>

Let me state this very clearly:</p>

<p class="don"> <strong><span id="red">There is no scientific evidence to
suggest that we use only 10% of our brains.</span></strong> </p>

<p>Let's look at the possible origins of this "10% brain use" statement 
and the evidence that we use all of our brain.</p>

<h3>Where Did the 10% Myth Begin?</h3>

<p><img src="gif/ein4.gif" class="flr" alt="ein" /> The 10% statement may
have been started with a misquote of Albert Einstein or the
misinterpretation of the work of Pierre Flourens in the 1800s.  It may
have been William James who wrote in 1908: "We are making use of only a
small part of our possible mental and physical resources"  (from <i>The
Energies of Men</i>, p. 12). <img src="gif/surgeon.gif" class="fl"  
alt="surgeon" /> Perhaps it was the work of Karl Lashley in the 1920s and
1930s that started it. Lashley removed large areas of the cerebral cortex
in rats and found that these animals could still relearn specific tasks.  
We now know that destruction of even small areas of the human brain
<i><strong>can</strong></i> have devastating effects on behavior.
That is one reason why neurosurgeons must carefully map the brain before
removing brain tissue during operations for epilepsy or brain tumors:  
they want to make sure that essential areas of the brain are not
damaged.</p>

<td><h3>Why Does the Myth Continue?</h3>
<p>Somehow, somewhere, someone
started this myth and the popular media keep on repeating this false
statement (see the figures).  Soon, everyone believes the statement
regardless of the evidence. I have not been able to track down the exact
source of this myth, and I have never seen any scientific data to support
it.  According to the believers of this myth, if we used more of our
brain, then we could perform super memory feats and have other fantastic
mental abilities - maybe we could even move objects with a single thought.  
Again, I do not know of any data that would support any of this. </p>

<h3>What Does it Mean to Use Only 10% of Your Brain?</h3>

<p>What data were used to come up with the number - 10%?  Does this mean 
that you would be just fine if 90% of your brain was removed?  If the 
average human brain weighs 1,400 grams (about 3 lb) and 90% of it was 
removed, that would leave 140 grams (about 0.3 lb) of brain tissue.  
That's about the size of a sheep's brain.  It is well known that damage to 
a relatively small area of the brain, such as that caused by a stroke, may 
cause devastating disabilities. Certain neurological disorders, such as 
Parkinson's Disease, also affect only specific areas of the brain.  The 
damage caused by these conditions is far less than damage to 90% of the 
brain.</p><p><img src="gif/sheepb.gif" alt="" /><br />Sheep

<h3>The Evidence (or lack of it)</h3>
<p><img src="gif/actionps.gif" alt="ap" class="fl" />
Perhaps when people use the 10% brain statement, they mean that only one
out of every ten nerve cells is essential or used at any one time?  How
would such a measurement be made?  Even if neurons are not firing <a 
href="ap.html">action potentials</a>, they may still be receiving signals
from other neurons.</p>

<p><img src="gif/smblu.gif" class="flr" alt="" />Furthermore, from an
evolutionary point of view, it is unlikely that larger brains would have
developed if there was not an advantage.  Certainly there are several
pathways that serve similar functions.  For example, there are several
central pathways that are used for vision.  This concept is called
"redundancy" and is found throughout the nervous system.  Multiple
pathways for the same function may be a type of safety mechanism should
one of the pathways fail. Still, <a href="image.html">functional brain
imaging</a> studies show that all parts of the brain function.  Even
during <a href="sleep.html">sleep</a>, the brain is active. The brain is
still being "used," it is just in a different active state. </p>

<p><img src="gif/brbrain.gif" width="150" height="216" class="flr" alt=""  
/> Finally, the saying "Use it or Lose It" seems to apply to the 
nervous system.  During development many new <a 
href="synapse.html">synapses</a> are formed.  In fact, some synapses are 
eliminated later on in development. This period of synaptic development 
and elimination goes on to "fine tune"  the wiring of the nervous system.  
Many studies have shown that if the input to a particular neural system is 
eliminated, then neurons in this system will not function properly.  This 
has been shown quite dramatically in the visual system:  complete loss of 
vision will occur if visual information is prevented from stimulating the 
eyes (and brain) early in development.  It seems reasonable to suggest 
that if 90% of the brain was not used, then many neural pathways would 
degenerate.  However, this does not seem to be the case.  On the other 
hand, the brains of young children are quite adaptable.  The function of a 
damaged brain area in a young brain can be taken over by remaining brain 
tissue.  There are incredible examples of such recovery in young children 
who have had large portions of their brains removed to control seizures.  
Such miraculous recovery after extensive brain surgery is very unusual in 
adults.</p>

<p>So next time you hear someone say that they only use 10% of their
brain, you can set them straight.  Tell them:</p> 
<p><strong> "We use 100% of our brains."</strong></p>

<p>Several people have mentioned that the movie <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872732/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Lucy</a> 
(2014) promotes the 10% of the brain myth.  If you find any news articles 
or advertisements using the 10% myth, please send them to me:  <a

<table><tr><td>Did you know?</td> <td>Dr. James W. Kalat, author of the 
textbook <i>Biological Psychology</i>, has another idea for the origin 
of the 10% myth.  Dr. Kalat points out that neuroscientists in the 1930s 
knew about the existence of the large number of "local" neurons in the 
brain, but the only thing they knew about these cells is that they were 
small.  The misunderstanding of the function of local neurons may have 
led to the 10% myth. (Reference: Kalat, J.W., <i>Biological 
Psychology</i>, sixth edition, Pacific Grove: Brooks/Cole Publishing 
Co., 1998, p. 43.)</td></tr></table>

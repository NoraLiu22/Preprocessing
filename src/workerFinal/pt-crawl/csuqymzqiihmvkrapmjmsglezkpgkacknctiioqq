    <p>Richard Parker’s “phenomenal” victory in the West Midlands mayoral election was beyond the Labour Party’s expectations, Sir Keir Starmer has said.</p><p>Mr Parker ousted Andy Street, the Tory incumbent, by 1,508 votes in a further blow to Rishi Sunak following a weekend of disappointing .</p><p>Labour declared victory shortly before Sandwell confirmed its result in a contest that went down to the wire. Mr Parker secured a total of 225,590 votes across the West Midlands Combined Authority, while Mr Street won 224,082.</p><p>Sir Keir said after the result: “This phenomenal result was beyond our expectations. People across the country have had enough of Conservative chaos and decline and voted for change with Labour. Our fantastic new mayor Richard Parker stands ready to deliver a fresh start for the West Midlands.</p><p>“My changed Labour party is back in the service of working people, and stands ready to govern. Labour will turn the page after fourteen years of Tory decline and usher in a decade of national renewal. That change starts today.”</p><p>In his acceptance speech, Mr Parker hailed Andy Street for having “led this region through a number of challenges”, telling him “you deserve great credit for that”.</p><p>He added: “You deserve credit for building up the Combined Authority into the powerhouse it is today, through the economic shocks and leading this region through Covid... I absolutely believe that while our politics are different, Andy, we both have the best interests of the West Midlands at heart.”</p><p>The new mayor then became visibly emotional as he thanked his wife and family for supporting him and “being there when I haven’t been there”, before urging Mr Sunak to call a general election.</p><p>The West Midlands mayor since 2017, Mr Street hoped his personal popularity, which far outstripped that of the Conservative Party and the Prime Minister, would have been enough to defy the party’s poor local and mayoral election performances.</p><p>Meanwhile Reform UK picked up more than 30,000 votes, helping to eat away at what was already a slim Tory majority, while Labour also shed tens of thousands of votes to a pro-Palestinian independent candidate in a foretaste of their own potential difficulties come the general election.</p>

I absolutely believe that while our politics are different, Andy, we both have the best interests of the West Midlands at heart.” Mr Parker became visibly emotional as he thanked his wife and family for supporting him and “being there when I haven’t been there”. “This is the most important thing I will ever do. This week people here voted for the person and the party. They recognised that a Labour mayor can make a positive difference in this region. Thank you. You have put your trust in me and I will repay that trust. I will deliver for you and your family... We will give this region the fresh start it richly deserves. “Let me be really clear. I will work with the council leader across the Combined Authority to make this region a roaring success again. I will support them, I will defend them and I will stand up for this region in the face of unprecedented Tory cuts. I will also stand up for the people who didn’t vote for me. This means so much for our region, but it also means so much to our country. “People are looking once again at our party and asking us to govern. Up and down the country people are looking for a fresh start. I hope the Prime Minister is watching tonight as well because in case you haven’t heard Rishi Sunak our people are calling for a general election.

Mr Parker secured a total of 225,590 votes across the West Midlands Combined Authority, while Mr Street won 224,082. Mr Street had hoped his personal popularity, which far outstripped that of the Conservative Party or Mr Sunak, would be enough to defy the party’s poor local and mayoral election performances.

The Lib Dems winning more councillors than the Tories had only happened once before. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, hailed the news, saying: “Up and down the country, Conservative MPs will be looking over their shoulder, terrified of the Liberal Democrats who have won more seats than them in this election. “This was the final test before the general election, and it’s clear Conservative MPs are on notice. We’ve moved forward in Blue Wall battlegrounds, and we’ve seen a real collapse in support for Rishi Sunak and his out-of-touch Government. “The choice for millions of people at the general election is clear – they can get a fair deal with the Liberal Democrats or have four more years of Conservative chaos.” Will Hazell, our Political Correspondent, has the full story here"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/05/04/local-election-results-live-mayor-2024-khan-susan-hall/#1714850685609","headline":"John Curtice: No 10 will be ‘bitterly disappointed’","datePublished":"2024-05-04T20:24:45.609+01:00","articleBody":"Downing Street will be “bitterly disappointed” with Andy Street’s defeat, Britain’s foremost polling guru has said.

Commenting on the West Midlands contest, he told the BBC: “To be honest our judgment up here is that also given what we’ve seen in the pattern of results that that target [in Sandwell] should be one that Labour should achieve... Labour’s claim [to have won] does seem to make sense”.

It was a by-election which led me to break the habit of a journalistic lifetime. Three years ago this Monday, in Hartlepool, the Conservative candidate gained the “safe” Labour seat, taking over half the vote (on a turnout a third higher than in Blackpool South). I suggested then, only slightly tentatively, that this result might mean the death of Labour. My point was that Sir Keir Starmer, the man brought in to rescue his party from the depths to which it had sunk under the extremist Jeremy Corbyn, was almost equally unattractive to voters. This second-referendum Remainer had little more to offer Red Wall voters than did Friend-of-Hamas Jeremy, I wrote. Sir Keir seemed to have got precisely nowhere. I should have stuck by one of the only two sensible rules about British general elections, which is that it is extremely hard to break the two-party system. So long as we have first-past-the-post elections, voters will naturally incline to a binary choice between the centre-Right and the centre-Left. After a bit, the floaters will get fed up with whichever lot they have put in and turn them out, putting in the other.

Yet as Britain wakes up to the very real prospect of a Labour government today, Tory voters must surely be asking themselves whether this one-night stand – be it with Labour, Reform or, God forbid, the Liberal Democrats or the Greens – really is marriage material.

Speaking on Sky’s Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, defended controversial claims by fellow frontbencher Wes Streeting that victory for Ms Hall would be “a win for racists, white supremacists and Islamophobes the world over”. “I think we’ve seen from the Conservatives in London, from Susan Hall, really a very divisive campaign that is damaging,” Ms Cooper said. “What we need is to be able to pull London together and we also need to be able to pull the whole country together. “We’ve been really clear about the way in which the Conservatives have campaigned in London being divisive and being damaging. What we need to do is bring the capital together and I think Sadiq Khan has been doing that.” A spokesman for Ms Hall said: “Insulting Londoners who are understandably worried about the epidemic of crime on our streets, the devastating impact of the Ulez expansion and Sadiq’s proposals for a pay-per-mile scheme shows just how out of touch Sadiq Khan is.

I will support them, I will defend them and I will stand up for this region in the face of unprecedented Tory cuts. I will also stand up for the people who didn’t vote for me. This means so much for our region, but it also means so much to our country.</p><p>“People are looking once again at our party and asking us to govern. Up and down the country people are looking for a fresh start. I hope the Prime Minister is watching tonight as well because in case you haven’t heard Rishi Sunak our people are calling for a general election. I will get this region’s future back, and I believe a Labour mayor working with a Labour government will help get Britain’s future back.”</p>

    <p>Downing Street will be “bitterly disappointed” with Andy Street’s defeat, Britain’s foremost polling guru has said.</p><p>Professor Sir John Curtice said No 10 now had “very, very little” to “hang on to” to convince Conservative MPs that “things are not so bad”.</p><p>Commenting on the West Midlands contest, he told the BBC: “To be honest our judgment up here is that also given what we’ve seen in the pattern of results that that target [in Sandwell] should be one that Labour should achieve... Labour’s claim [to have won] does seem to make sense”.</p><p>Sir John said Labour winning the West Midlands provided “the big climactic end” to the local election results and that it would disappoint the Tories who had been “banking on winning in order to dispel the electoral gloom” hanging over the party.</p>

    <p>Susan Hall, the unsuccessful Tory candidate, congratulated Sadiq Khan on his victory.</p><p>“Spending a year campaigning on this election has been an honour and a privilege. I have loved speaking to Londoners about the things that matter to them. The thing that matters to them most, and to me, is reforming the Met and making London safe again. I hope Sadiq makes this his top priority. He owes it to the families of those thousand people who have lost lives to knife crime under his mayoralty.</p><p>“And I hope too that he stops patronising people like me who care. This isn’t an episode of The Wire. This is real life. On his watch.</p><p>“I will continue to hold Sadiq to account, to stand up for the hardworking families, for motorists and for women. I love London and I urge Sadiq to try harder to make it better for all our sakes.”</p>

    <p>Sadiq Khan said after the formal declaration: “It is truly an honour to be elected for a third term and to do so with record levels of support from Londoners, with an increased margin of victory. But today’s not about making history, it’s about shaping our future. A future where children can be nourished with free school meals and breathe clean air, where all Londoners are given the support and helping hand they need to fulfil their potential and where our social fabric is strengthened and our diverse communities cherished and celebration.</p><p>“My determination to make sure London leads from the front with world-leading green action remains as strong as ever. We’ve already made great strides cleaning up our air and will continue to tackle pollution whether it’s found in our streets or in our rivers.</p><p>“At the same time I pledge to have a focus on all the other issues Londoners care about - the rising cost of living, crime on our streets, homelessness, affordable housing. For the last eight years London has been swimming against the tide of a Tory government and now with a Labour government that’s ready to govern under Keir Starmer, it’s now time for Rishi Sunak to give the public a choice.</p><p>“A general election will not just pave the path to a new direction for our country, it’ll make bold action Londoners want to see a reality.”</p><p>Thanking his mother, wife and daughters for their “strength and support”, he said the threats and abuse he had received were “upsetting and wrong, and I’m sorry for putting you through this... This work is worth doing. It means being able to give to other families the same life changing opportunities this city has extended to ours... My final thank you must go to my fellow Londoners, the people who make this city not only special, but the greatest city in the world.</p><p>“Once again, you’ve proved that London is a city of progress, a city of pluralism and above all a city of possibility, a beacon for openness, inclusion and equality across the world. It’s Londoners who inspire me every day to continue our mission of building a fairer, safer and greener London in what I hope will be a year of great change, a future Labour government will mean we can go much further and accomplish so much more, ensuring that for our capital and our country, our brightest days are still ahead of us.”</p>

    <p>Sadiq Khan was drowned out boos as he said “thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you London.”</p><p>The losing Britain First candidate walked across the stage shouting “Khan killed London”, before there were cheers as audience members who heckled Mr Khan were removed.</p><p>“It is the honour of my life to serve the city that I love, and I am beyond humbled right now,” the Mayor said. “I want to express my deep gratitude to my fellow Londoners and make this pledge to you. I promise to repay the trust you’ve paid in me by working tirelessly by working to deliver the safer, fairer and greener London you deserve.</p><p>“It’s been a difficult few months. We faced a campaign of non-stop negativity but I could not be more proud that we answered fearmongering with facts, hate with hope and attempts to divide with efforts to unite. We ran a campaign that was inkeeping with the spirit and values of this great city. A city that regards our diversity not as a weakness but as an almighty strength, and one that rejects hard, Right-wing populism and looks forward not back.”</p>

It’s a vote for building more council homes, delivering free school meals and a greener London.</p><p>“Londoners have clearly rejected the overwhelmingly negative and divisive campaign run by the Tories.

    <p>Asked how positioning himself as an independent voice would square with a Labour government and if he would be “equally forthright” with Sir Keir Starmer, Andy Burnham told Sky: “I certainly would point out if things were wrong, I won’t hold back from doing that.</p><p>“You only do these jobs properly if you take a place-first approach. They are different roles to Westminster roles where it’s party-first under the whips system. If you don’t do these roles with a place-first approach, then I don’t think you do these roles properly. And sometimes that means you might have to say to the Government of the day you’ve got this wrong, or that isn’t fair to us.”</p>

It’s hard out there, people are really struggling and politicians really need to listen to what they’ve heard on the doorstep.

    <p>A fair summary might be that, after 14 years, voters feel the Conservative Party has delighted them long enough, but they have not yet decided exactly what to do about it, <em>writes </em><strong>Charles Moore</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>The options available to them now include Reform, and also – probably more attractive to most – doing nothing at all and staying at home.<br /><br />It was a by-election which led me to break the habit of a journalistic lifetime. Three years ago this Monday, in Hartlepool, the Conservative candidate gained the “safe” Labour seat, taking over half the vote (on a turnout a third higher than in Blackpool South). I suggested then, only slightly tentatively, that this result might mean the death of Labour. <br /><br />My point was that Sir Keir Starmer, the man brought in to rescue his party from the depths to which it had sunk under the extremist Jeremy Corbyn, was almost equally unattractive to voters. This second-referendum Remainer had little more to offer Red Wall voters than did Friend-of-Hamas Jeremy, I wrote. Sir Keir seemed to have got precisely nowhere.<br /><br />I should have stuck by one of the only two sensible rules about British general elections, which is that it is extremely hard to break the two-party system. So long as we have first-past-the-post elections, voters will naturally incline to a binary choice between the centre-Right and the centre-Left. <br /><br />After a bit, the floaters will get fed up with whichever lot they have put in and turn them out, putting in the other. Each of the two main parties will quite often suffer internal convulsions, but in the end, enough of them will stay together to survive. The splittists will fail. </p></blockquote><p><a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/03/local-elections-results-rishi-sunak-blackpool-south/"><em><strong>Charles Moore: The Tories are blinded by an obsession with replacing Rishi</strong></em></a></p>

    <p>If Susan Hall is “far-Right”, how are the Left now describing neo-Nazis? The Tory candidate for London mayor was repeatedly smeared during the election campaign, <em>writes </em><strong>Camilla Tominey</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>It started with her rival Sadiq Khan likening the hair salon owner, 69, to Donald Trump, before going on to suggest that “some of the things [Susan Hall] has said and done are racist”.<br /><br />He backed up the accusation by citing examples including her “liking Enoch Powell”, and “amplifying a rainbow swastika”, as well as suggesting that the “black community has a problem with crime” and advocating more stop and search.<br /><br />The reality was rather different. Hall liked a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, which stupidly suggested Powell should be included in a set of playing cards featuring great British prime ministers. And she responded to a rainbow swastika image, idiotically posted by the Left’s other bête noire, Laurence Fox, with a facepalm emoji. The mother of two has also questioned whether the Notting Hill carnival should be relocated in the interests of public safety, and liked a post on X describing Khan as “the nipple-high mayor of Londonistan”. <br /><br />While some may question the wisdom of all this online activity, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting’s suggestion that “a win for Susan Hall and the Conservatives is a win for racists, white supremacists and Islamophobes the world over,” was an insult to the electorate. </p></blockquote><p><a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/04/the-lefts-opponents-are-not-all-far-right-extremists/"><em><strong>Camilla Tominey: Those with moderate views are being smeared</strong></em></a></p>

    <p>Sir Keir Starmer has been in Mansfield celebrating Labour’s Claire Ward becoming the first ever East Midlands Mayor.</p><p>He told activists: “This is a fantastic victory, a really important victory. You fought for this with a very, very positive campaign. I came here myself to campaign with you, I was struck by the positivity of the case that you were making. And you were rewarded with the trust and confidence of the voters in the East Midlands, a really, really important area for us.</p><p>“The underlying constituencies, the voters across the whole of the East Midlands, came out and voted Labour and that is a very significant moment in our history.

    <p>Amid all the talk of a “seismic” victory for Labour, a closer inspection of the election results so far may leave Sir Keir Starmer with a nagging doubt at the back of his mind, <em>writes our Associate Editor </em><strong>Gordon Rayner</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>He already knows that overturning the 80-seat majority won by Boris Johnson in 2019 is not a given, as no party in history has achieved that scale of turnaround in one leap.<br /><br />And he now knows that Labour’s position on Gaza is causing a collapse in the Muslim vote, <a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/05/03/labour-suffers-shock-defeat-in-oldham-gaza-crisis-blamed/">shown most starkly in Oldham</a>, where his party lost overall control of the council, but also evidenced elsewhere.<br /><br />Nor can Sir Keir ignore the fact that Harlow, a town he visited twice, including on Wednesday, stayed loyal to the Tories, which can only be interpreted as a sign that voters remain unconvinced by him. Labour failed to win the Tees Valley mayoral election and there are suggestions that Labour may have disappointing results in some of the other mayoral elections that have yet to declare, despite spending huge sums trying to wrestle them from the Tories.<br /><br />So while it was undeniably a superb night for Labour, it stopped short of being the sort of slam dunk that would close the books on a Labour majority at the general election.</p></blockquote><p><a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/05/03/labours-collapse-muslim-vote-major-warning-sign-starmer/"><em><strong>Read Gordon’s full analysis here</strong></em></a></p>

    <p>Good morning from Birmingham city centre, where counting is finally underway in the critical West Midlands mayoral race. Rishi Sunak will be hoping Conservative incumbent Andy Street can buck the national trend and cling on for a third term, while Sir Keir Starmer will be vying for a major Tory upset to round off a strong set of local elections for Labour.</p><p>It is arguably the most important contest still to be declared - besides London - with a lot at stake for both the Prime Minister and his opposite number.</p><p>A win would come as a huge relief to Mr Sunak, providing a silver lining in an otherwise dreary weekend for the Conservatives. With both the Tees Valley and West Midlands mayoralties in the bag, he’ll feel things could have gone a whole lot worse.</p><p>It would also provide a useful opportunity for the Tories to turn the heat up on Labour, whose performance in areas with a higher Muslim population - such as Birmingham - is expected to suffer following a backlash to its stance on Gaza.</p><p>A Labour win, on the other hand, would be a huge thorn in Mr Sunak’s side. As a key asset to the party outside Westminster, Mr Street’s fortunes will be seen as a bellwether for the Tories’ prospects in the general election later this year.</p>

    <p>An anti-LTN backed by the father of Hollywood actress Florence Pugh has won four seats in Oxford in the local election.</p><p>The Independent Oxford Alliance (IOA) has capitalised on a growing backlash against low traffic neighbourhoods, causing an upset on Friday by taking three seats from Labour in the Oxford City Council election.</p><p>The grassroots political party, which supports community projects and small businesses, is backed by Pugh’s father Clinton, who owns two restaurants in the area and claims he has lost business because of LTNs.</p><p>Mr Pugh, who considered running in the election but ultimately chose not to because of business commitments, welcomed the success. He said: “All of the people who have joined this party are people who are fed up with the LTN chaos in this city.”</p>

    <p>Local election results so far demonstrate Rishi Sunak has “very little to show” for his efforts to recover the Conservative brand following Liz Truss’s premiership, Sir John Curtice said.</p><p>The election expert told the BBC: “There is nothing in these results to suggest contrary to the opinion polls that the Conservatives are actually beginning to narrow the gap on Labour, and that so far at least, Rishi Sunak’s project which has tried to recover from the disaster - from the Conservatives’ point of view - of the Liz Truss fiscal event, that project has still got very little to show for it.</p><p>“That in a sense is the big takeaway.</p><p>“Now the Conservatives, as when all parties do badly in elections, they always want you to focus on the exception rather than the rule, and Tees Valley and probably the West Midlands are the exceptions not the rule.”<br />On Labour losses over its stance on Gaza, Sir John said: “At the moment I think what we would find if we had a general election is that Labour might well fall back in some of these seats, but because the Labour Party is already so strong, they would probably still succeed in winning the parliamentary election.</p><p>“But yep, this is a big message to Labour from these local elections, is that you are indeed now in trouble with some of your Muslim former supporters.”</p>

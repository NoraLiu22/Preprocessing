It may seem hard to believe that microscopic
<a href="/chromista/bacillariophyta.html">diatoms</a>,
with their delicate silica skeletons
only forty millionths of a meter long, can be related to the giant
<a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/chromista/phaeophyta.html>kelps</a>,
which may grow as long as fifty meters, or that either one is related to the
<a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/chromista/oomycota.html>downy mildew</a>
that nearly destroyed the French wine industry.  But they are related --
placed together in the great kingdom-level taxon Chromista.

The name Chromista means "colored", and although 
some chromists, like mildews, are colorless, most are photosynthetic.  
Even though they are photosynthetic, chromists are not at all closely 
related to plants, or even to other algae.  Unlike plants, the Chromista 
have <b>chlorophyll c</b>, and do not store their energy in the form 
of starch.  Also, photosynthetic chromists often carry various 
<a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss3/pigments.html>pigments</a> 
in addition to chlorophyll, which are not found in plants.  It is these 
pigments which give them their characteristic brown or golden color.
<P>
Photosynthetic chromists are some of the most important organisms in 
aquatic ecosystems.  The cool and temperate coasts of continents are lined with 
<b>kelp forests</b>, where many commercially important fish and shellfish feed 
and reproduce, and diatoms are frequently the primary source of food for 
both marine and fresh-water organisms.
<P>
In additional to their roles as producers for marine animals, chromists 
provide many products for industry.  <b>Alginates</b> are viscous 
chemicals extracted from kelp; these are used in paper production, toothpaste, 
and in ice cream, where the alginate helps to improve texture and ensure 
uniform freezing and melting.  Ancient chromists, like 
<a href=/chromista/prymnesiophyta.html>coccolithophorids</a>, are 
responsible for deposits of limestone and other rock formations.  The 
skeletons of dead chromists accumulate on the floor of lakes and oceans, 
where they may become thick deposits of silica or calcium carbonate.  
These deposits are useful for interpreting ancient climate, and in 
searching for oil.

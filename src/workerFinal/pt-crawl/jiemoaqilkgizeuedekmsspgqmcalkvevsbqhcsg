<h2 align="left">Growing Proteas in Your Garden</h2>

<hr>

<p>In planting proteas there is only one variable which can be
changed. Your garden is fixed: the soil is there and can be only
slightly modified by the use of fertilizers, mulch and compost;
the climate cannot be changed much, although water can be added
and frost sensitive species can be covered in winter; and, wind,
salt-spray and shade are constraints you either have to live with
or do without. So the only option available (other than moving
house) is to select appropriate proteas - ones that will grow
where you live.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="matching.htm">Matching Proteas to Your
Garden</a> to ensure that you choose the 'right' kind of protea
that will hopefully grow in your garden.</p>

<p>That said, if you are desperate, there is an option you might
try. Most Pincushion allies will graft well onto a <i>Ls
conocarpodendron</i> or <i>Ls cuneiforme</i> rootstock. So with a
little horticultural fiddling, you may be able to get those
spectacular high-altitude Pagodas, root rot-susceptible
Pincushions, and the specialist ericoid proteas, into your garden
after all. For the &quot;specialist&quot; who wants the Marsh
Rose or Golden Mimetes, this is the way to go - your only major
restrictions are the rootstock&#146;s soil requirements and the
availability of material for grafting! More work needs to be done
on suitable root-stocks for the Spiderhead allies, but I think
that is only a matter of time.</p>

<p>If you have a good loamy soil, well-drained with a
coarse-sandy feel, then you have free range. Almost any protea
will feel at home under these conditions.</p>

<p>Coastal gardens are among the most problematic. The number of
species which can grow in alkaline coastal soils is very limited,
but try Limestone Fynbos species. Visit Still Bay, De Hoop, Cape
Agulhas or Gans Bay on the south coast, or Jakkalsfontein or
Koeberg on the west coast and get a feel for the species which
will do very well in these garden. Salt spray is a problem for
proteas, but wind is relatively well tolerated by most species.
Of course, houses from Gordon&#146;s Bay to Hermanus are on acid
sands and can easily grow the Fynbos species which used to occur
there.</p>

<p>Clay-rich soils are a real problem. Few proteas will grow well
in clay unless these are well drained. The clayish-soil loving
proteas tend to be drab, so try the Limestone Fynbos (see Coastal
Garden) species - they are quite tolerant of a variety of soil
types and quite hardy. </p>

<p>The best method though is to look around. Choose plants from
your area, taking careful note to match the soils in which they
grow with your garden&#146;s. For the more widespread species,
choose morphs from your area. Unfortunately, few nurseries will
be able to tell you where the <i>Pr repens</i> or<i>
Ld&nbsp;salignum</i> on sale originated from - it may be dying
because it should be growing 400 km away in a different climate
and soil. So think about planting from seeds - collected from
your area, of course.</p>

<p>Indeed, often the hardest task of planning a protea garden is
finding the plants to plant. If your local nursery cannot help,
approach the various botanical societies - many have specialist
nurseries which may help you. Alternatively, grow your plants
from seed! It may take a few years longer, but the reward is well
worth it!</p>

<p>Most Conebushes are far hardier than Sugarbushes and
definitely more so than most Pincushions. It is unfortunate that
their use is not appreciated. Most especially the Stream
Conebushes can be pruned regularly and will form good screens and
hedges. With Conebushes the emphasis should be on the foliage and
not primarily the cones or flowerheads. For yellow and red
foliage in spring, few Fynbos plants compare with Conebushes.</p>

<p>Pincushions are quite susceptible to <i>Phytophthora</i> root
rot and you may have to experiment extensively (but hopefully not
expensively) to find a spot in your garden without the pathogen.
Better drained spots are best. Alternatively, go for the species
which are less susceptible (<i>Ls conocarpodendron, reflexum</i>),
or graft your <i>cordifolium</i> or <i>tottum</i> onto a hardier
rootstock.</p>

<p>If you are having continuous problems with establishing
proteas, have your soil tested. Proteas will not grow if the
potassium or phosphorous is too high. So avoid - like the plague
- bonemeal, chicken manure, other manures, fertilizers rich in
these elements. Poisoning by these elements results in yellow or
black leaves, dying at the edges and weak-looking plants. If you
feel the need to fertilize, use ammonium-based, rather than
nitrate-based fertilizers. Fertilizing is only really necessary
if you are removing cut flowers, or if you want to get plants to
grow faster, but it does reduce the lifespan of the plants and
make them more susceptible to root rot and other diseases and
stresses.</p>

<p><b>Gardening with birds</b></p>

<p>Proteas are ideal for attracting Sunbirds and Sugarbirds, but
will also attract White-eyes, Weavers, Starlings and other birds
to feed at the nectar. All large-flowered Sugarbushes, all
large-flowered Pincushions, and all Pagodas are highly
recommended for this purpose in any book on the topic! </p>

<p>There are no indigenous proteas which produce berries or
edible fruit and so attracting fruit- or seed-feeding birds
cannot be achieved with proteas.</p>

<p><b>Water-wise gardening</b></p>

<p>All proteas must be carefully watered for the first dry
season, and often the second as well (<i>i.e.</i> summer in the
winter-rainfall area). Thereafter, most species should be able to
take themselves through the summer without any watering. The
principle here is that the plants need to get their tap roots to
the water table, which may drop many metres in summer. Once they
have reached the water table, they can be considered established.
In areas where the drop in the water table exceeds approximately
10&nbsp;m, it may not be possible to &quot;establish&quot;
proteas without watering in the dry season. So be prepared to
rescue any wilting plants with some water, but don't overdo it or
you will give both yourself and the plants extra costs and
unnecessary stresses.</p>

<p><b>Fynbos Gardens</b></p>

<p>Proteas are &quot;Fynbos&quot;! Some might point out the Cape
Reeds, Heaths, Buchus, and other elements that make up Fynbos,
but proteas are the most appealing elements in any Fynbos Garden,
to the extent that many consider the other elements to be mere
fillers or fringes. Choose any protea, to your hearts content,
but don't forget the minor elements as well.</p>

<p><b>Arid Gardens</b></p>

<p>In arid regions it is best to select species capable of
dealing with very low water conditions. Among the best are: <br>
<i>Ld&nbsp;nobile, Ld&nbsp;pubescens, Ld&nbsp;rubrum,
Ls&nbsp;erubescens, Ls&nbsp;rodolentum, Pr glabra,
Pr&nbsp;nitida, Pr&nbsp;laurifolia, Se&nbsp;aitonii, Se flava.</i></p>

<p><b>Container Plants</b></p>

<p>The method of growing Proteas in the early 19th Century was to
have proteas in glasshouses and pots. The pots could be placed
outdoors during summer and returned indoors to protect them from
frost. Provided pots are not too small, most proteas should grow
in pots. Many of the smaller species may be well suited to pots.
Someone needs to experiment and determine some local rules of
thumb (those for the UK were enumerated by Richard Salisbury and
Joseph Knight in 1810). Elsenberg was experimenting with the
Mountain Rose <i>Pr&nbsp;nana</i> and a Spiderhead hybrid <i>Se
florida X rosea</i> as indoor pot plants, but apparently indoor
light levels are too low to induce flower bud formation.
Jonkershoek Nature Conservation had spectacular Marsh Rose <i>Or
zeyheri</i> plants for many years, each in half drums. These
dozen plants produced hundreds of fruit per year. Needless to
say, these plants were grafted on <i>Leucospermum</i> rootstocks
and needed careful pruning to prevent their getting leggy and
dying (the cuttings can be used to establish new grafted plants).
I have no doubt that the other high-altitude Pagodas, such as <i>Mimetes
arboreus, argenteus, capitulatus, hottentoticus, pauciflorus,
saxatilis </i>and<i> splendidus </i>will all thrive with similar
treatment. Perhaps someone needs to experiment with a rootstock
for King Gustavs Sceptre <i>Pa sceptrum-gustavianus</i>. I am
sure Van Stadens Sceptre <i>Pa reflexus</i> would work very well.</p>

<p><b>Postscript</b></p>

<p><i>It is easy to compile lists of species from books. The
problem is deciding which species &quot;might&quot; do well (the
so called &quot;wish lists&quot;), which species occasionally do
well, and which species are ideal for certain conditions. If you
have had success with certain species, or if you know of species
which will do well under certain conditions, or, if you have
tried the species mentioned above without success, please contact
me, and I will include your observations in future lists. Tony.</i></p>

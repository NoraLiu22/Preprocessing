<p>
The BlendEd project will be coming to a successful conclusion in Spring of 2007, with the release of its outputs and findings, after two years of work to transform the delivery of Higher National qualifications in Scottish colleges. 
</p>

<p>
BlendEd is a collaborative Scottish e-learning Transformation project funded by the Scottish Funding Council, one of six million-pound projects. The BlendEd consortium, which is led by Reid Kerr College, comprises six Further Education Colleges, COLEG (Colleges Open Learning Exchange Group) and the JISC Regional Support Centre Scotland S&amp;W. The combined student populations of these colleges comprise 17% of the total FE enrolment for Scotland.
</p>

<p>
BlendEd aimed to introduce an educationally sound blended learning delivery model within HNC Social Care and HND Business/Office Admin. The essence of the approach has been to produce topic-based electronic learning materials, as discrete learning objects, for existing Higher National units, and to support staff in delivering these to learners in new and flexible ways. Key project outputs have included:
</p>


<ul type="disc">
	<li>A thoroughly tested blended learning model and implementation plan</li>

	<li class="spacetop">Quality assured resources to support the blended delivery model</li>

	<li class="spacetop">Robust staff development programmes to support the sector in adopting the model</li>

	<li class="spacetop">The BlendEd Cookbook to provide guidance for implementing blended learning</li>

	<li class="spacetop">The development of an entirely new staff role &#150; Blended Learning Technologist (BLT)</li>
</ul>


<p>
Pilot delivery of the new programmes in the partner colleges have produced excellent results, and met with positive responses from learners and teaching staff alike. In a number of the partners the BlendEd model is now being rolled out, supported by the newly appointed BLTs. Work is now going on to produce final edits of the 500+ learning objects produced by the project, before these are released to the sector. 
</p>

<h3 class="blue"><A name="METCALFE">An Introduction to Designs on Learning</a></h3>

<p class="italics">
Contributed by:<br>
Miles Metcalfe<br>
Head of ICT R&amp;D<br>
Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication<br>
Chislehurst, Kent, United Kingdom<br>
&lt;m.metcalfe&#064;rave.ac.uk&gt;
</p>

<p>
Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication [<a href="#1">1</a>] is an institution  in South London offering specialist undergraduate and postgraduate  programmes in design and broadcasting. The College's programmes are highly vocational, and, in common with much design education in the  UK, can be described as having an "extreme social constructivist" pedagogy.
</p>

<p>
Over the last decade, both design and broadcasting have become, it  could be argued, branches of computing. As the dominant means of  production in design, the computer has created both new businesses (for example, website design) and new business models (off-shored, just-in-time manufacture). Similarly, broadcasting is in the process of a digital revolution &#150; from computers facilitating the production techniques of "reality TV" to YouTube [<a href="#2">2</a>].
</p>

<p>
During the same period, education in design and communications has  been conservative in its use of technology. Elearning through a VLE (virtual learning environment), with its strong text orientation, is  not a natural form for the highly personal, visual, tactile, and  flexible activities that characterise the institution's programmes.  Although the institution uses Moodle [<a href="#3">3</a>], and benefits from that application's social-constructivist leanings, many staff find the environment constricting, and alien to their teaching methods.
</p>

<p>
Many students, of course, have a substantial pre-existing online presence before coming to college, with social networking services such as MySpace, and public blogging services predominating. For students, these services typically meet needs in their personal domain, unrelated to their learning activities at College.
</p>

<p>
Faculty believe that blogging is an increasingly important tool for  creative professionals to manage their reputation, and promote  themselves. Of course, the prospects for the use of blogging (and  indeed the technology itself) may be limited, but, we believe, the  skills are an important requirement for practitioners. Thanks to  funding from the JISC [<a href="#4">4</a>] through the Designs for Learning programme [<a href="#5">5</a>], we are developing model learning designs which incorporate blogging into practice-based education. Our approach emphasises, in particular, blogging as a technique for creative practitioners to connect with an "audience" &#150; in contrast to activity within a VLE, or, indeed a classroom or the studio. The project is currently  piloting some designs, using an institutional blogging server running Blojsom [<a href="#6">6</a>] &lt;<a href="http://blogs.rave.ac.uk/blojsom/blog/">http://blogs.rave.ac.uk/blojsom/blog/</a>&gt;, which aggregates the  most recent posts. In order to validate &#150; and better understand &#150;  some of the presuppostions of the project about the usefulness of social software, much of the project activity is shared on a wiki at &lt;<a href="http://confluence.rave.ac.uk/confluence/x/eBU">http://confluence.rave.ac.uk/confluence/x/eBU</a>&gt;, where more information is available.

<H4>CrossRef to Add Hundreds of Journals from Low-income Countries</H4>

<p>December 5, 2006 - &quot;CrossRef, the multi-publisher linking
association, announced today that it had reached agreement with three new
partners to include journals from developing countries in its linking
network.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The three organizations are INASP (the International Network for the
Availability of Scientific Publications, <a href="http://www.inasp.info">http://www.inasp.info</a>), who will
initially register its Nepal, Bangladesh and Vietnam Journals Online content
with CrossRef; NISC (the National Inquiry Services Center,
<a href="http://www.nisc.co.za/">http://www.nisc.co.za/</a>), a South African publisher of eight current journals
as well as several bibliographic databases and books; and AJOL (African
Journals Online, <a href="http://www.ajol.info">http://www.ajol.info</a>), a not-for-profit aggregation of over
250 varied African journals. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'For some time CrossRef has been exploring how it could partner with
publishers and journal publishing initiatives in regions of the world where
scholarship and publishing are clearly under-resourced,' said Ed Pentz,
CrossRef's Executive Director. 'We believe offering CrossRef's services on
an affordable basis to qualified publishers in these regions and
interlinking them with the global research literature will help raise the
visibility of these journals and contribute to their success.'&quot;</p>

<H4> IMLS Calls for 2007 National Leadership Grant Applications</H4>

<p>December 1, 2007 - The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) is accepting grant applications to the agency's 2007 National Leadership Grant (NLG) program. The previously published deadline of February 1, 2007 has been moved to March 1, 2007.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since 1998 National Leadership Grants have supported the innovative thinking that is needed to help libraries and museums meet the changing needs of the American public. They are an important investment in the future of library and museum service. In 2007, these grants will provide an opportunity to explore important research questions, develop and test new models of library and museum service, and help build digital resources.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This year the agency is bringing back its Library and Museum Community Collaboration category. Collaboration grants provide opportunities for libraries and museums to partner with each other and with a host of other community organizations including public broadcasters, schools, universities, cultural and performing arts organizations, and health and social service providers. With this change, the three funding categories for 2007 are as follows:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Building Digital Resources</li>
	<li>Library and Museum Community Collaboration</li>
	<li>Research and Demonstration&quot;</li>
</ul>


<p>&quot;Museum applicants may request between $25,000 and $1,000,000; the range for library applicants is $50,000 to $1,000,000. In addition, collaborative planning grants of $30,000 are for the first time to enable project teams from more than one institution to work together to plan a collaborative project in any of the three categories.&quot;</p>

<p>For more information, please see the full press release at &lt;<a href="http://www.imls.gov/news/2006/120106.shtm">http://www.imls.gov/news/2006/120106.shtm</a>&gt;.</p>

<H4>New open access agreement for Oxford Journals and National Library of Medicine</H4>

<p>November 28, 2006 - &quot;Oxford Journals today announced a new agreement with the National Library of Medicine (NLM) that will allow all content published as open access under its Oxford Open model to be available from PubMed Central.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The agreement makes it easier for authors publishing with Oxford Journals to meet the requirements of their funding bodies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), who request all NIH-funded content to be deposited into PubMed Central within 12 months of online publication.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Previously, authors who chose to participate in the Oxford Open initiative were entitled to self-archive a post-print of their accepted manuscript and/or the final published version of their article into an institutional or central repository. The new agreement means that all content published under Oxford Open will be immediately deposited into PubMed Central by Oxford Journals directly. Oxford Journals has published almost 2000 open access articles in 2006 through its Oxford Open models, including optional open access for 49 journals, and full open access with Nucleic Acids Research.&quot;</p>

<p>For more information, please see the full press release at &lt;<a href="http://www.oxfordjournals.org/news/2006/11/28/new_open_access_agreement_for_ox/new_open_access_agreement_for_ox.html">http://www.oxfordjournals.org/news/2006/<br>11/28/new_open_access_agreement_for_ox/new_open_access_agreement_for_ox.html</a>&gt;.</p>

<H4>Carnegie Mellon Research Shows Laptops in Classrooms Isolate Students</H4>
<p><b><i>Study Finds Laptops Give Students Greater Flexibility, But Don't Improve Performance</i></b></p> 

<p>November 20, 2006 - &quot;In a two-year study of sophomore classes in Carnegie Mellon University's School of Design, researchers in the university's Office of Technology for Education and the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence have found that the use of laptops significantly changed students' work habits, but not always for the better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The study was designed to investigate how students use laptops inside and outside the classroom and how these practices enrich or diminish their university experience. The School of Design was chosen for the study because of the central role computers play in many aspects of its students' work, its similarity to other computer-intensive departments and faculty interested in investigating the advantages and disadvantages of a school-wide laptop policy....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All students were given laptops for their classroom and personal use for either one semester or a full academic year. Multiple measures, including classroom observation, student interviews, surveys and work logs &#150; as well as student design processes and products &#150; were collected to provide a rich source of both qualitative and quantitative data. These data points were also collected from students without laptops during the first semester of the study. &quot;</p>

<p>For more information, including a list of findings, please see the full press release at &lt;<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2006/november/Nov.%2020%20-%20Laptop%20Study.shtml">http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2006/november/Nov.%2020%20-%20Laptop%20Study.shtml</a>&gt;.

<H4>University of Virginia joins leading research libraries in partnership with Google to increase discovery of knowledge &#150; and to offer library books to global audience</H4>

<p>November 14, 2006 - &quot;The University of Virginia and Google today announced U.Va. as the ninth partner in the international Google Books Library Project, joining Harvard, Stanford, Oxford, the University of Michigan, and other leading research libraries in the collaborative effort to make their vast resources more accessible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Google project digitizes books from major libraries around the world and makes them searchable on Google Book Search.  Hundreds of thousands of selected books from the University Library's collections will be digitized by Google and made searchable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Google will digitize selected portions of the Library's great collections of American history, literature, and humanities works, and incorporate them into the Book Search Project&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Book Search was specifically designed to comply with copyright law.  Anyone will be able to freely view, browse and read U.Va.'s books in the public domain.  For books protected by copyright, scholars will be able to discover relevant books via key-word searches, and they will get basic background (such as the book's title and the author's name), at most a few lines of text related to their search, and information about where they can buy or borrow a book.  If publishers or authors don't want to have their books digitized, they can be excluded.&quot;</p>

<H4>Searching for musical treasure: how to find the formula for a hit single</H4>

<p><i><b>OMRAS2: Online Music Recognition and Searching 2.0</b></i></p>

<p>November 14, 2006 - &quot;Where are the good songs in that two million song on-line music store? Are undiscovered works by Handel, Vivaldi or Purcell hidden among the items in a digitised score collection? Is there a mathematical formula for hit singles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;These are just some of the questions researchers from Queen Mary, University of London, and Goldsmiths, University of London, are hoping to answer with their new research project, OMRAS2. With a value of some &pound;2.5m, OMRAS2 is the first 'Large Grant' announced by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The grant will employ 12 people and involve partnership with four other universities....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The core scientific research will be on computational and mathematical methods to enable rapid searching and browsing of very large collections of scores and recorded music. But one of the motivations for OMRAS2 is not only to do scientific research on music, but to enable music academics (musicologists) and others to use the tools and knowledge that the scientists provide. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OMRAS2 will also look at how music and information about music (like CD insert booklets) will be enjoyed at home - not just downloading, but searching, recommending, and browsing.&quot;</p>

<p>For more information, please contact Si&#226;n Halkyard,  &lt;s.halkyard&#064;qmul.ac.uk&gt; or Professor Mark Sandler,  &lt;mark.sandler&#064;elec.qmul.ac.uk&gt; Queen Mary, University of London, or Dr Michael Casey, &lt;m.casey&#064;gold.ac.uk&gt;, Goldsmiths College London</p>

<H4>The Digital Preservation Coalition announces a call for entries
for the third Digital Preservation Award</H4>

<p>November 13, 2006 announcement from Nadia Semple: &quot;The Digital Preservation Coalition is delighted to announce the call for entries
for the third Digital Preservation Award.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you completing an exceptional digital preservation project? If so, why not apply for the Digital Preservation Award, worth &pound;5000.
&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is the eleventh anniversary of the Conservation Awards, sponsored by Sir Paul McCartney, and is the third year to include the prestigious Digital
Preservation Award, which recognises the many new initiatives being carried out
by museums, libraries, galleries and archives in the challenging field of
digital preservation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Awards will be presented at the British Museum on the 27th of September 2007. Short-listed applicants attract significant publicity, and receive a certificate recognising their achievement at the presentation event.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be eligible for the Digital Preservation Award, a project must demonstrate
leadership and advancement in digital preservation which will benefit the UK. It
must focus on preserving digital materials (whether "born digital" or digitised
copies), rather than on the use of digitisation as a preservation reformatting
tool. Only projects that have been completed by 31 March 2007 will be considered
for the Award. Applicants from overseas are welcomed, providing that the project can
demonstrate benefit to the UK. The deadline for applications is 31 March 2007.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To apply for the Digital Preservation Award online, please complete the DPA/07
application form on the Conservation Awards website:

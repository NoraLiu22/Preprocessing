</style><h2>The Interpreter – Terms of Use</h2>

<p>The Interpreter (<a href="https://www.lowyinterpreter.org/" target="_blank">www.lowyinterpreter.org</a>) <strong>the Site</strong> is published by the Lowy Institute for International Policy (the “Institute”). It publishes daily commentary and analysis on international events for a global online audience.</p>

<p>These terms govern your use of the Site and by using the Site, you are agreeing to be bound by them (including the content supply terms in part 2 of these terms in the event that you submit, or agree with the Institute to prepare, content for the Site). The Institute may vary these terms from time to time, so you should check them regularly. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all content on the Site and any new features or functionality that enhance the Site shall be subject to these terms. If any provision of these terms is held void, unenforceable or illegal, that provision will be severed, and the remaining provisions will have full force and effect.</p>

<ol><li><strong>1. GENERAL TERMS OF USE</strong>

<ol><li>
<p><strong>1.1 Intellectual Property</strong></p>

<p>Unless otherwise indicated, all copyright, trade marks and other intellectual property rights in or on the Site (including all information, data, text, graphics, images, website design, trade marks and logos displayed on the Site) are owned by the Institute, its related entities or its third party licensors.</p>

<p>You may download and view content or print a copy of material on this Site for personal, non-commercial use provided you do not modify the content in any way (including any copyright notice).</p>

<p>You must not, without the Institute's express written permission or as otherwise permitted by applicable copyright legislation:</p>

<ul><li>otherwise copy, use, reproduce, adapt, store in a retrieval system, transmit, print, display, perform, publish or create derivative works from any part of the content or design of this Site (<strong>Republish</strong>);</li>
<li>cause any of the content of the Site to be framed or embedded in another website; or</li>
<li>use any trade marks displayed on the Site without the express written permission of the relevant owner.</li>
</ul><p>If permission to Republish any part of this Site (including any article on this Site) is given, you must acknowledge the Institute as the source.</p>

<p>In circumstances where you receive consent from the Institute to republish any article on this Site, you acknowledge and agree that you will:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) indemnify the Institute and its employees, agents and related companies; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) otherwise be exclusively liable,</p>

<p>for any legal claim whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected to the Republication of any content from this Site.</p>

<p>The Institute reserves the right to require that you do not Republish content from the Site and the Institute may exercise this right by giving notice to you.

<p>You also consent to your comment being altered, edited or adapted for use by the Institute or its sublicensees, or to ensure your comment does not infringe these terms or breach the law, as the Institute sees fit. Although the Institute will generally attribute you as the author, it's not always possible. So you consent to the Institute not attributing authorship to you, or only attributing your registered username.</p>

<p>You must ensure that your comment does not contain anything that breaches these terms or the comments policy, or any laws or legal rights, including by defaming any person or breaching anyone’s intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>(a) notify you whether the Institute accepts or rejects any Contribution within 14 days of receiving that item. You acknowledge that the Institute will have an absolute discretion to decide whether it will accept or reject any item of Contribution;</p>

<p>(b) if agreed between you and the Institute in writing, pay you any agreed amount for any Contribution that is accepted by the Institute; and</p>

<p>(c) where the Institute uses, reproduces, edits, modifies, publishes, prints or communicates to the public any Contribution, include your name as the author of the Contribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.3 Licence</strong></p>

<p>You grant to the Institute a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free licence to:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) use and reproduce the Contribution in any media throughout the world, including on the Site and the Institute’s other websites and other publications, communications or materials and on third party websites, newspapers and other publications. For example, the Content may be used on the Institute’s site <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/">www.lowyinstitute.org</a> or reproduced in a written publication;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) permit any person to assist the Institute do any of the things referred to in paragraph (a) above; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(c) sub-license any of the rights described in paragraphs (a) or (b) to any person in connection with the purposes referred to in paragraph (a) above. For example, the Institute may sub-license these rights to its contractors or service providers who manage the Institutes websites or to third parties who publish your Content on newspapers or their digital sites (for example, where the Institute syndicates its content on a local news website).</p>

<p>The rights granted to the Institute under clause 2.3 are exclusive during the Exclusivity Period and non-exclusive thereafter unless otherwise agreed with the Institute in writing. During the Exclusivity Period, you must not use or reproduce, or permit any other person to use or reproduce, the Content on any media without the Institute’s prior written consent.</p>

<p>The Exclusivity Period is the period commencing on the date of submission of your Contribution to the Institute and ending on:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) the date that the Institute notifies you that it rejects your Contribution; or</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) the date that is 7 days after the date of first publication of your Contribution by the Institute,</p>

<p style="margin-left:34.0pt;">as applicable, or such other period as agreed between you and the Institute in writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.4 Edits</strong></p>

<p>The Institute reserves the right to edit or modify your Contribution and publish the edited Contribution in its discretion, subject to the Institute complying with these Contribution Terms. You consent to the Institute identifying you as the author of the edited Contribution. You also consent to any act or omission which would otherwise constitute an infringement of your Moral Rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.5 Opinions</strong></p>

<p>Opinions and other statements expressed by Contributors are theirs alone, not opinions of the Institute </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.6 Warranty and Indemnity for Contributions</strong></p>

<p>You indemnify the Institute and its Representatives against all losses, damages, liabilities, expenses and costs (including legal costs) suffered or incurred by the Institute or its Representatives, arising out of or in connection with any action, liability, claim, proceeding or suit relating to your Contribution. .</p>

<p>If an action, liability, claim, proceeding or suit relating to your Contribution arises, then without limiting any of the Institute’s other rights or remedies, you must at the Institute’s request provide to the Institute all reasonable assistance, which may include conducting the defence of an Infringement Claim, however you must not settle any  action, liability, claim or proceeding without the Institute’ prior written consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.7 Fees and Payment</strong></p>

<p>If payment of a fee for a Contribution (<strong>Fee</strong>) has been agreed between you and the Institute in writing, you may invoice the Institute for the Fee following acceptance of the Contribution by the Institute. All invoices must be Tax Invoices in the form required by the Institute from time to time.</p>

<p>The Institute will pay any correctly rendered Tax Invoice (as defined in the GST Act) within 30 days of the end of the month in which that invoice was received subject to the deduction or withholding of any applicable amounts as required by law.</p>

<p>If the Institute disputes the calculation of the Fee set out in any Tax Invoice, then the Institute may withhold payment of the disputed amount until the dispute is resolved, but the Institute will pay all non-disputed amounts in accordance with this clause 2.7.</p>

<p>The Fees payable by The Institute are the total fees payable for the provision of the Contribution. You are responsible for paying any costs and expenses that you incur in the course of providing the Contribution, including any travel and accommodation costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.8 GST</strong></p>

<p>Despite the definition of consideration in the GST law, or unless otherwise expressly stated, the Fee or other sums payable or consideration to be provided under or in accordance with these Contribution Terms are exclusive of GST.</p>

<p>If you or the Institute (the “<strong>supplier</strong>”) makes a taxable supply under or in connection with these Contribution Terms, the other party will pay to the supplier at the same time, and in addition to the GST-exclusive consideration, an amount equal to the GST payable on that supply.</p>

<p>The supplier will, as a precondition to the payment of GST, give the other party a Tax Invoice.</p>

<p>If an adjustment event arises in connection with a supply made under these Contribution Terms, the supplier agrees to give the other party an adjustment note in accordance with the GST law.</p>

<p>If these Contribution Terms require you or the Institute to pay for, reimburse or contribute to any expense, loss or outgoing suffered or incurred by the other party, the amount required to be paid, reimbursed or contributed by the first party will be reduced by the amount of input tax credits (if any) to which the other party is entitled in respect of the reimbursable expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.9 Withholding tax</strong></p>

<p>If a law requires the Institute to deduct an amount in respect of Taxes from a payment under these terms, then the Institute will:</p>

<p>(a) deduct the amount for the Taxes; and</p>

<p>(b) pay an amount equal to the amount deducted to the relevant Government Agency in accordance with applicable law and give the original receipts to you.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that the Institute is not required to pay an additional amount to you so that, after the deduction is made, you would receive a net sum equal to the sum that it would have received if the deduction had not been made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.10 General</strong></p>

<p>These Contribution Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties about its subject matter. Any previous understanding, agreement, representation or warranty relating to that subject matter is replaced by these Terms and has no further effect.</p>

<p>You must not sub-contract, assign, novate, transfer or otherwise deal with these Contribution Terms or any rights or obligations under them to anyone without the prior written consent of the Institute.</p>

<p>These Contribution Terms can only be varied by agreement in writing by the parties.</p>

<p>A right may only be waived in writing, signed by the Institute giving the waiver, and no other conduct of the Institute (including a failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, the right) operates as a waiver of the right or otherwise prevents the exercise of the rights.</p>

<p>Nothing in these Contribution Terms will be taken to constitute you as an employee, agent, partner or joint venturer of the Institute nor are you authorised to represent yourself as acting, or to incur any obligation, on behalf of the Institute. The Institute will not make any additional payments, superannuation contributions or provide insurance coverage for you and, to the extent that there is a change in law or that your supply of Content under these Terms is deemed by law to require the provision of such benefits, the Institute will deduct any amounts due to you or required to be paid by the Institute from the Fee.</p>

<p>These Contribution Terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales. Both parties agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales.</p>

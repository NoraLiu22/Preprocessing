                                that is part of a much larger area of understanding
                                called <b><a href="../physgeoglos/g.html#geography">geography</a></b>.
                                Most individuals define geography as a field
                                of study that deals with <b><a href="../physgeoglos/m.html#map">maps</a></b>.
                                This definition is only partially correct. A

                                has a history that stretches over many centuries. Over this

                                into an important form of human scholarship. Examining the
                                historical evolution of geography as a discipline provides
                                some important insights concerning its character and methodology.
                                These insights are also helpful in gaining a better understanding

                                studies occurred more than four thousand years ago. The main
                                purpose of these early investigations was to map features
                                and places observed as explorers traveled to new lands. At
                                this time, Chinese, Egyptian, and Phoenician civilizations
                                were beginning to explore the places and spaces within and
                                outside their homelands. The earliest evidence of such explorations
                                comes from the archaeological discovery of a Babylonian clay
                                tablet map that dates back to 2300 BC. </font></p>
                                <p align="left" class="text"><font size="+1">The
                                    early Greeks were the first civilization
                                    to practice a form of geography that was
                                    more than mere map making or <a href="../physgeoglos/c.html#cartography"><b>cartography</b></a>.
                                Greek philosophers and scientist were also interested in
                                learning about spatial nature of human and physical features
                                found on the Earth. One of the first Greek geographers was <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus">Herodotus</a></b> (circa
                                484 - 425 BC). Herodotus wrote a number of volumes
                                that described the human and physical geography
                                of the various regions of the Persian Empire. </font></p>
                                <p align="left" class="text"><font size="+1">The ancient Greeks were also
                                interested in the form, size, and geometry of the Earth. <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a></b> (circa
                                384 - 322 BC) hypothesized and scientifically demonstrated
                                that the Earth had a spherical shape. Evidence for this idea
                                came from observations of lunar eclipses. Lunar eclipses
                                occur when the Earth casts its circular shadow on to the
                                moon's surface. The first individual to accurately calculate
                                the circumference of the Earth was the Greek geographer <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a></b> (circa
                                276 - 194 BC). Eratosthenes calculated the equatorial circumference
                                to be 40,233 kilometers using simple geometric relationships.
                                This primitive calculation was unusually accurate. Measurements
                                of the Earth using modern satellite technology have computed
                                the circumference to be 40,072 kilometers.</font></p>
                                <p align="left" class="text"><font size="+1">Most
                                    of the Greek accomplishments in geography
                                    were passed on to the Romans. Roman military
                                commanders and administrators used this information
                                    to guide the expansion of their Empire. The
                                    Romans also made several important additions
                                    to geographical knowledge. <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo">Strabo</a></b> (circa
                                64 BC - 20 AD) wrote a 17 volume series called "<b>Geographia</b>".
                                Strabo claimed to have traveled widely and recorded
                                what he had seen and experienced from a geographical
                                perspective.
                                In his series of books, Strabo describes the
                                cultural geographies of the various societies
                                of people found from Britain to
                                as far east as India, and south to Ethiopia and
                                as far north as Iceland. Strabo also suggested
                                a definition of geography
                                that is quite complementary to the way many human
                                geographers define their discipline today. This
                                definition suggests that
                                the aim of geography was to <em>"<b>describe
                                the known parts of the inhabited world</b> ... <b>to
                                write the assessment of the countries of the world [and]

                                <p align="left" class="text"><font size="+1">During the second century AD, <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a></b> (circa
                                100 - 178 AD) made a number of important contributions
                                    to geography. Ptolemy's publication <b><em>Geographike
                                hyphegesis</em></b> or <em>"<b>Guide
                                to Geography</b>"</em> compiled and summarize much

                                time. Some of his other important contributions
                                include the creation of three different methods

                                    the Roman period. For the most part, the
                                    Middle Ages (5th to 13th centuries AD) were
                                    a time of intellectual stagnation. In Europe,
                                    the Vikings of Scandinavia were the only
                                    group of people carrying out active exploration
                                    of new lands. In the Middle East, Arab academics
                                    began translating the works of Greek and
                                    Roman geographers starting in the 8th century
                                    and began exploring southwestern Asia and
                                    Africa. Some of the important intellectuals
                                    in Arab geography were Al-Idrisi, Ibn Battutah,
                                    and Ibn Khaldun. Al-Idrisi is best known
                                    for his skill at making maps and for his
                                    work of descriptive geography <b><em>Kitab nuzhat al-mushtaq

                                  exploration were commissioned by a variety
                                  of nation states in Europe. Most of these voyages
                                  were financed because of the potential commercial
                                  returns from resource exploitation. The voyages
                                  also provided an opportunity for scientific
                                  investigation and discovery. These voyages
                                  also added many significant contributions to
                                  geographic knowledge (<b>Figure 1a-2</b>).

Behaim's invention was a significant advance over two-dimensional maps because

                                        Varenius</a></b> (1622-1650) published an important geographic
                                    reference titled <b>Geographia
                                    generalis</b> (<b>General
                                    Geography</b>: 1650). In this volume, Varenius
                                    used direct observations and primary measurements
                                    to present some new ideas concerning geographic
                                    knowledge. This work continued to be a standard
                                    geographic reference for about a 100 years.
                                    Varenius also suggested that the discipline
                                    of geography could be subdivided into three
                                    distinct branches. The first branch examines
                                    the form and dimensions of the Earth. The
                                    second sub-discipline deals with tides, climatic
                                    variations over time and space, and other
                                    variables that are influenced by the cyclical
                                    movements of the Sun and moon. Together these
                                    two branches form the early beginning of
                                    what we collectively now call physical geography.
                                    The last branch of geography examined distinct
                                    regions on the Earth using comparative cultural
                                    studies. Today, this area of knowledge is
                                    called cultural geography. </font></p>
                                <p align="left" class="text"><font size="+1">During the 18th century, the
                                German philosopher <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Immanuel
                                Kant</a></b> (1724-1804) proposed that human
                                knowledge could be organized in three different
                                ways. One way of organizing knowledge was to
                                classify its facts according to the type of objects
                                studied. Accordingly, zoology studies animals,
                                botany examines plants, and geology involves
                                the investigation of rocks. The second way one
                                can study things is according to a temporal dimension.
                                This field of knowledge is of course called history.
                                The last method of organizing knowledge involves
                                understanding facts relative to spatial relationships.
                                This field of knowledge is commonly known as
                                geography. Kant also divided geography into a
                                number of sub-disciplines. He recognized the
                                following six branches: Physical, mathematical,
                                moral, political, commercial, and theological
                                geography. </font></p>

                                    knowledge saw strong growth in Europe and

                                    also saw the emergence of a number of societies

                                    examines the geology and physical geography
                                    of the Earth. This work is considered by
                                    many academics to be a milestone contribution
                                    to geographic scholarship. Late in the 19th
                                    Century, Ratzel theorized that the distribution
                                    and culture of the Earth's various human
                                    populations was strongly influenced by the
                                    natural environment. The French geographer <b><a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=77260&amp;tocid=0&amp;query=paul%20vidal%20de%20la%20blanche">Paul

                                    revolutionary idea. Instead, he suggested
                                    that human beings were a dominant force shaping
                                    the form of the environment. The idea that
                                    humans were modifying the physical environment
                                    was also prevalent in the United States.

                                    the Agricultural Society of Rutland County,
                                    Vermont. The subject of this speech
                                was that human activity was having a destructive
                                    impact on land, especially through deforestation
                                    and land conversion. This speech also became
                                    the foundation for his book <b><em>Man
                                and Nature</em></b> or <b><em>The Earth

                                <p align="left" class="text"><font size="+1">During
                                    the first 50 years of the 1900s, many academics
                                    in the field of geography extended the various
                                    ideas presented in the previous century to
                                    studies of small regions all over the world.
                                    Most of these studies used descriptive field
                                    methods to test research questions. Starting
                                    in about 1950, geographic research experienced
                                    a shift in methodology. Geographers began
                                    adopting a more scientific approach that
                                    relied on quantitative techniques. The <b><a href="../physgeoglos/q.html#quantitative_revolution">quantitative
                                revolution</a></b> was also associated with
                                a change in the way in which geographers studied the Earth
                                and its phenomena. Researchers now began investigating process
                                rather than mere description of the event of interest. Today,
                                the quantitative approach is becoming even more prevalent
                                due to advances in computer and software technologies. </font></p>

                          we are now ready to formulate a somewhat coherent definition.
                          This definition suggests that geography, in its simplest
                          form, is the field of knowledge that is concerned with
                        how phenomena are spatially organized. Physical geography
                        attempts
                          to determine why natural phenomena have particular
                        spatial patterns and orientation. This online textbook
                        will focus primarily on the <font size="+1"><b><a href="../physgeoglos/e.html#earth_sciences_tradition">Earth
                          Science Tradition</a></b></font>.
                          Some of the information that is covered in this textbook
                          also deals with the alterations of the environment
                          because of
                          human interaction. These pieces of information belong
                          in the <font size="+1"><b><a href="../physgeoglos/h.html#human_land_tradition">Human-Land
                          Tradition</a></b></font> of
                    geography. </font></p>

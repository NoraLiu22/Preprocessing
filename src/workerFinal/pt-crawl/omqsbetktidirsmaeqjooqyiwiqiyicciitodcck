		<h2>The Evolution of an Indigenous Wooden Sailing Vessel</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		The "modern" wooden 'Pinisi' type has been derived from similar craft that have been in use in and around
		
		Indonesia for several centuries. According to some sources, similar types have 
		existed prior to the 1500's, such as the 
		<a href="22m_arabian_dhow.htm">Arabian Dhow</a>.</p>
	<p>
		The sailing 'Pinisi' hull form in many ways resembles a cross between two traditional American sailing vessel 
		types, the Pinky Schooner and the Tancook Whaler, even though the 'Pinisi' hull type pre-dates those Western 
		hull forms by centuries... In other words, in its original form the 'Pinisi' was a double ended hull type, 
		having sharply raked stem and stern post. There was not a centerline rudder however, as with the American craft. 
		Instead the local Indonesian craft in the past most often made use of twin rudders, one on each aft quarter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Used both as transport and as cargo vessels, the craft we are calling 'Pinisi' (variously spelled Pinissi, 
		Pinisiq, or Phinisi) have traditionally been built on the beach, where the logs have come from the forests of 
		Sulawesi (Celebes) and Kalimantan (Borneo), then transported to the boat building sites.
	</p>
	<p>
		Historically, several interesting rituals and ceremonies have been part of building such a vessel, beginning 
		with choosing the right trees for critical parts of the structure. Just as with traditional wooden boat building 
		in the West, various rituals continue throughout the building process to initiate and celebrate each stage, such 
		as the all important laying of the keel. <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<div>
		<h2>The 'Pinisi' Tradition</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		A few clarifications of terminology are in order... 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>The Builders:  </b>Although the builders of these craft are commonly lumped under the category of <b>
		Bugis</b> 
		peoples, there are four cultural sub-sets of boat builders to be separately distinguished in South 
		Sulawesi
		(per the writings of Horst Liebner).  The primary groups are the <b>Konjo</b> of the southern tip of South 
		Sulawesi (from near the towns of Ara, Bira, and Tanah Biru), the <b>Mandar</b> of West Sulawesi to the north of 
		Makassar, the <b>Bugis</b> from the region near Wajo on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Bone (the central gulf 
		between the two halves of Sulawesi), and the <b>Makassarese</b> from the region around the city of Makassar.  
		Among these groups, the <b>Konjo</b> of
		South Sulawesi appear to have had the primary and most influential role as boat builders.</p>
	<p>
		<b>The Vessels:  </b>Technically, the term '<b>Pinisi</b>' refers to the rig itself.  In particular 
		'Pinisi' refers to the usual gaff-ketch type of rig.  Locally this rig is referred to as a "seven sail 
		schooner" even though the aft gaff sail is slightly smaller than the forward gaff sail, in fact making it a 
		ketch rig.</p>
	<p>
		Per Horst Liebner, the correct term for the sharp-stern sailing craft is 'palari' or 'lamba' among the <b>Konjo</b> 
		boat builders of 
		South Sulawesi.  When the stem and stern post are straight, and are set at a sharply raked 
		angle to the keel, the hull form is the 'lamba' as opposed to the 'palari' which make use of curved timbers for 
		both stem and stern.&nbsp;
		Since the term '<b>Pinisi</b>' has come to be commonly applied to the hull form as well, we will use the word '<b>Pinisi</b>' 
		here to refer to the sailing hull type for the purposes of our discussion...</p>
	<p>
		These 'Pinisi' have traditionally been built in a variety of sizes. Although in the past the craft tended to be 
		smaller, it is not uncommon to find 30 to 40 meter vessels under construction, with an occasional Pinisi ranging 
		up to around 50 meters (close to 165 feet on deck) or larger.
		The widespread use of a sharply raked stem and stern post is simply the practical result of making efficient use 
		of the timber lengths that can be conveniently brought down from the forest. In this way the vessel can be quite 
		large and still have a relatively modest length of keel timber. Conveniently, it also makes them very good sea 
		boats!</p>
	<p>
		In many Indonesian boat building locations, good timber has become difficult to obtain, therefore costly. Many 
		builders have begun using shorter and shorter timbers, resulting in a compromised hull structure, particularly 
		in larger craft. With many of the ritual ceremonies becoming less and less common, some may suggest that this 
		too has conspired against the longevity of the ships.
	</p>
	<p>
		One very significant improvement in the quality of available timber has been made possible by the Konjo builders 
		themselves... The builders of larger vessels have actually re-located!  Quite a number of the Konjo 
		builders from Southwest Sulawesi have simply moved, in order to be close to larger supplies of good quality 
		timber.&nbsp;
		In so doing, the builders of Southwest Sulawesi have literally carved a new building site and a new village out 
		of the jungle in Kalimantan (Borneo). Several new building sites are located in Kalimantan Selatan (South 
		Kalimantan) and Kalimantan Timur (East Kalimantan), on the banks of rivers close to the supply of timbers. It is 
		here that they have been able to obtain the size and quality of timbers necessary for building wooden vessels of 
		up to 50 or so meters in length.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most advanced 
		of these builders have sought new sites located farther to the north in Kalimantan Timur. When asked about this our friend and master builder <em>Pak Tandra</em> 
		simply says, <i><b>"We are boat builders. We will always follow the wood!"</b></i><br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<div>
		<h2>Pinisi Hull Structure</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		In prior years, <b>teak</b> may have been one of the preferred woods to use for the structure, although locally 
		it is considered rather soft and inferior. Since teak is not especially favored and is actually no longer 
		plentiful, other tropical hardwoods are used.  Presently in Indonesia, <b>Ironwood</b> and <b>Bangkirai</b> 
		are preferred for boat structures.
	</p>
	<p>
		Obtained from the low land forests of Kalimantan, Ironwood is locally called Kayu Ulin (eusideroxylon zwageri). 
		One of the hardest woods in Indonesia, Ironwood has a specific gravity of 0.88 to 1.19...! Although quite heavy, 
		it has excellent physical properties and is not vulnerable to termites or other tropical wood eating insects or 
		fungus.
		Kayu Bangkirai (shorea leavifolia) is also highly favored. Slightly less heavy than Ulin, Bangkirai makes 
		excellent planking, decking, stringers, and upper structure.&nbsp;
		Many other tropical woods are locally used, most of which have proven to be inferior for one reason or other.
	</p>
	<p>
		Built in the same way as the Indonesian Perahu type of hull, Pinisi have always been assembled using wooden pegs 
		to join the timbers. We would call the fasteners " trunnels" or tree nails.&nbsp;
		The sequence of assembly is different than we in the West would ordinarily assume. First the keel is laid, then 
		the stem and stern post are erected, as usual. Then however, rather than setting up the whole array of sawn 
		frames or 'mold frames' these vessels are built by applying the planking first..!</p>
	<p>
		First the planks next to the keel (the garboard planks) are fit and pegged to the keel. Then the next planks are 
		pegged to the garboard planks using "blind" dowels along the edges of the planks. One by one, additional planks 
		are added until there is the shape of a boat. This of course is all done by "eye" according to the experience of 
		each master builder.&nbsp;
		With the planking nearly completed, frames are fitted into the hull shell. The frames are pegged to the planks, 
		to the keel, and to each other where the frame segments are joined. The frame butt ends either lap across the 
		keel (Sulawesi style), or are joined to a floor member (more common in Kalimantan), depending on the tradition 
		from which the individual boat builders have come.
	</p>
	<p>
		This "planking first" approach may seem odd to our rigidly defined approach to shaping a ship in the West, but 
		this is as the builders among the Indonesian islands have done it since no one knows when. This is very much the 
		most common method used throughout Indonesian, Malaysian, and other South and Southeast Asian waters, and the 
		method has served the people very well indeed. <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<div>
		<h2>Different Boatbuilding Methods...</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		<b>Clinker Built Boats</b>:  As built by Western boat builders, 'clinker built' boats have each plank's 
		lower edge lapped over the plank below. The laps are fastened with clench nails that function somewhat like 
		rivets all along the overlap. The clench nails go from outside inward, then are bent over slightly onto dome 
		shaped washers called roves (pronounced 'rooves') on the inside.  In the West in modern times, the 
		fastenings are usually bronze.  In prior times, both in the West and elsewhere, the lap would have either 
		been sewn with sinew or other strong fibers, or would have been fastened with 'trunnels' (tree nails).</p>
	<p>
		With clinker built boats, the frames are applied <b>afterward</b> and are virtually always steam bent or 
		laminated out of thinner strips, glued in place.  In the West, clinker built boats are almost always built 
		over
		<a href="_drawings/30m_phinisi_mould_frame.gif">mould frames</a>, though if the frames are laminated, one can 
		create the laminated frames first, attach them to the keel, then begin planking onto the frames.</p>
	<p>
		In the West, small clinker boats are often built upside down, bigger ones upright. The clinker style produces 
		quite a light structure that is very rigid. Clinker style planking is usually reserved for smaller craft. There 
		is no absolute boundary, but presently somewhere around 40 feet on deck is where these Clinker built types give 
		way, and 'Carvel' planking begins to dominate.</p>
	<p>
 <b>Carvel Built Boats:  </b>Carvel planking refers to the method of planking where the planks are placed edge to 
edge onto frames, which are placed first.  By this method, the planks are fastened only to the frames.</p>
	<p>
 <b>The 'Pinisi' Method:  </b>In the areas surrounding the Indian Ocean, throughout Southeast Asia, and in some of 
the SW Pacific, the planking is done first, prior to the framing being placed, much as with a clinker built boat, but 
with the planks placed edge to edge. In order to do this, the planks are "blind edge fastened" to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		In centuries past, edge fastening was accomplished by sewing the plank edges together. In current times on both 
		larger and smaller craft, the plank edges are blind edge fastened using wooden dowels, locally called 'passak.' 
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout these regions, mould frames are not used.  Instead the boats are shaped "by eye" following the 
		traditions of the local builders in each area. After the planks are in place, frames are then fitted into the 
		emerging hull shape and fastenings are added to attach the frames to the planks.&nbsp;
		The planking on all 'Pinisi' is therefore what Westerners would refer to as "carvel" even though the planking is 
		erected and fastened similarly to the "clinker" style of planking.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although historically the Pinisi builders used 'passak' (trunnels) exclusively for edge fastening the planks, 
		iron drifts have now become commonplace, placed about every fourth 'passak.'  These iron drifts and steel 
		bolts have not replaced 'passak' altogether.  'Passak' are still used at the plank scarfs, for the majority 
		of the plank edge dowels, and for fastening every other plank to the frames.  Steel bolts are then used to 
		fasten the remaining intermediate planks. The steel bolts extend all the way through to also fasten the 'Lepe 
		Lepe' (ceiling stringers) inside the frames.
	</p>
	<p>
		Per the writings of Adrian Horridge, the introduction of metal fastenings took place after the motorization of 
		these vessels.  This system is very strong... it makes ultimate sense structurally.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<div>
		<h2>Decks... East vs. West...</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		Several notes here regarding the deck structure... First though, it should be noted that it is extremely rare 
		indeed that a wooden vessel's deck does not leak somewhere...! Boatbuilders have used various strategies to 
		address this situation. Here is a brief summary of what has proven to work best, and why...<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h4>
		Commercial / Cargo Vessel Decks</h4>
	<p>
		<strong>  </strong>On a cargo Pinisi built in Indonesia, and on any commercial traditional wooden vessel 
		or ship built in the West, the decks will always be a single layer, and they will be caulked and then 'paid' 
		with a mixture stuff to finish the seam.</p>
	<p>
		In the West the caulking would first be a layer of spun cotton in the root of the seams, which would be topped 
		with oakum. Both would be hammered in to the seam using a mallet and a caulking iron. After that, the seams 
		would traditionally be 'paid' using a mixture of tar and rosin. The rosin used is essentially the same stuff 
		that's used for a violin bow... which makes it 'squeak' and vibrate the strings...!</p>
	<p>
		The tar-to-rosin ratio is adjusted according to climate. On Alaskan fishing vessels for example, not much rosin 
		is required to stiffen the tar. For boats in the tropics, quite a lot more rosin is used. The objective is to 
		keep the tar stiff enough so that it does not soften in the sunlight to the point where it will "track" all over 
		the deck when being walked on, but not so stiff as to be inflexible or brittle... This is the traditional method 
		for commercial wooden vessels and it is not varied from too much if at all in the West.</p>
	<p>
		On a cargo Pinisi, the decks are likewise always single layer. In Indonesia, all of the methods used in the 
		West are accomplished in exactly the same way, however the materials used are quite different. If done 
		traditionally, the deck planks are first caulked using a fine fluff gathered from a specific type of palm tree, 
		then topped with more coarse fibers from another type of palm, both of which are worked into the seams using a 
		mallet and a tool similar to a Western caulking iron. The deck planks are then 'paid' (i.e. topped off) by 
		sealing the seams with a rosin-like substance. This stuff is a locally derived natural substance that is 
		essentially boiled tree sap from a specific type of tree. If I discover what tree they use, I will include that 
		information here...</p>
	<p>
		The traditional Indonesian methods and materials appear to work just as well as any of the traditional Western 
		methods or materials, if not better. The deck seam sealant (boiled tree sap) does stay sufficiently hard so it 
		does not track around the deck in the tropical heat, and it is more clear (i.e. not black tar based) so even if 
		it did soften, the tracks would not be objectionable.</p>
	<p>
		In the West, the decks are either left 'dry' or they are coated with boiled linseed oil and / or tung oil 
		combined with just enough Japan dryer to get it to 'set up' so it is not sticky. In either case, the decks will 
		always be regularly sloshed with sea water to keep them clean and to preserve them, as well as to keep them 
		'swelled up' to help prevent leaks.</p>
	<p>
		In Indonesia, we have observed the use of a similar deck coating substance on the well-built cargo Pinisi, the 
		composition of which I do not know, but which has a very similar appearance to linseed oil. Probably it is a 
		tree sap derivative.</p>
	<p>
		In Indonesia a number of recent attempts have been made to substitute other materials such as nylon cordage for 
		the caulking (which is terrible because it is a synthetic, does not 'soak up' and does not give), combined with 
		epoxy for the seam compound (also terrible because it does not hold up in the sunlight and does not flex 
		sufficiently). Both of these are quite a lot more expensive than traditional materials, the epoxy in particular 
		(which is also toxic), and they do not in the end provide any better service.</p>
	<p>
		In other words, if single layer decks are used, strictly traditional materials and methods are very much to be 
		encouraged in order to seal the deck seams, as would be done for a cargo or fishing vessel. <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h4>
		Yacht Decks...<strong>   </strong>
	</h4>
	<p>
		On yachts though, several departures from these traditional methods are used. The more successful of them, I 
		will describe as follows:</p>
	<p>
		Yachties often want to make use of teak top decks, as well as some alternative to tar and rosin. Most commonly 
		this approach takes the form of a plywood or planked sub-deck, topped with a separate teak deck.&nbsp;
		If the sub-deck is of planking, then first the sub-deck planks are caulked and 'paid' in exactly the same way as 
		if it were a single layer deck - using the same methods and materials as described above.
		After that, the deck is sealed in a way similar to the way a flat roof is waterproofed, i.e. using a method 
		similar to a 'hot roof.' Typically a layer of tar is applied onto the sub-deck which is then overlaid with heavy 
		tar impregnated felt (we often call it Irish Felt).</p>
	<p>
		After the sub-deck is thoroughly sealed, it will then be planked over with a layer of teak decking of lesser 
		thickness. In Indonesia an excellent teak alternative is available, locally called Kayu Bangkirai (shorea 
		laevifolia, also known as shorea laevis). These top-deck seams are not 'caulked' with any kind of fibers, 
		however when finished the seams are 'paid' with a sealant that is poured or squeezed into pre-machined grooves 
		in the planking.</p>
	<p>
		Typically on yachts, in order to avoid tar, there are a variety of other kinds of seam sealant used. The most 
		successful of these tar-substitutes in the West is one form or other of Thiokol which cures to a rubbery mastic 
		that does not 'track' around the deck. Boatlife is one type of seam sealant that uses Thiokol, however the best 
		of these products is always two-part.</p>
	<p>
		Once applied, the seams need to be sanded flush. Usually the decks will be left 'dry' so the bond is not broken 
		(wood to Thiokol) by penetration of any oils. This seam compound regularly needs to be reefed out and renewed 
		(i.e. every few years) - and more often in the tropics. <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h4>
		Which Deck Is Best...???</h4>
	<p>
		Either method will work very well if it is done in a traditional manner using traditional materials and good 
		workmanship. In other words, this choice is primarily a matter of preference, i.e. whether you want the 'teak 
		decking' finish and look, or if you will be happy with a more commercial look to the top deck.</p>
	<p>
		I have specified details for both methods, since there is no structural reason to prefer one over the other. The 
		total thickness will be the same in either case.&nbsp;
		In my own view, I do not object to the commercial look of a single layer deck. If it is done nicely and 
		maintained well, it looks every bit as 'right' as a teak yacht deck - and also looks a bit more authentic on a 
		traditional craft.&nbsp;
		If the deck is constructed of two layers, the tar and felt paper (or equal / similar stuff) layer is quite 
		important to get right. This layer will ideally be done in exactly the same way one would seal a flat roof on a 
		house, as long as 'flexible' materials are used and the thickness is adequate.</p>
	<p>
		Whether the decks are single layer or double layer, it is inevitable that planked wood decks will eventually 
		leak. With a single layer deck, though it will in all likelihood leak more often, it will be far easier to find 
		the leaks and fix them.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<div>
		<h2>Pinisi Sailing Rig</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		According to most sources, Indonesian and Malaysian sailing craft of all sizes originally carried a triangular 
		sailing rig of a type that is still in use by many of the smaller craft in Indonesia. With various Asian and 
		Western influences in the last several centuries, some of the larger craft began to make use of rectangular 
		sails similar to the Lateen or Lug rig, some of which are also still in use today.
	</p>
	<p>
		The 'Pinisi' have been among the largest of the surviving local sailing craft. During the last hundred years or 
		so, the local sailing craft adopted the Western fore and aft gaff ketch rig. This rig ordinarily carries three 
		jibs, two gaff sails, and a tops'l above each gaff. These boats are referred to as Pinisi' or alternately may be 
		called "seven sail schooners."
	</p>
	<p>
		Though it may have the look of a Western type of gaff rig, a few unusual features make the 'Pinisi' sail rig 
		unique. First, the gaffs are left "standing." The sails are laced to the mast and to the gaff. In order to reef 
		the sails, they are "brailed" to the spars. This is a very old method, but one that works well.  Another 
		difference is that on the Pinisi, the forward mast and the bowsprit are built as a tripod or bipod, depending on 
		the local tradition. This makes practical use of conveniently available timber sizes.
	</p>
	<p>
		For more information about the difference between the traditional Pinisi <strong>sailing</strong> types vs. the 
		more 'modern' <strong>motorized</strong> "KLM" cargo vessel types, please visit our <a href="phinisi_vs_klm.htm">
		Sailing Pinisi</a> web page.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<div>
		<h2>Motors...!</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		Until the mid to late 1970's, the large fleet of cargo carrying Pinisi throughout Indonesia were strictly 
		sailing vessels. Since around 1978, there has been a push to motorize the fleet of sailing Pinisi. The presence 
		of an engine has changed these craft rather dramatically.&nbsp;
		Currently, the vast majority of the local cargo fleet have been given engines.  As a result, they are now 
		referred to as 'KLM' for <b><i>Kapal Layar Mesin</i></b>, literally translated as <i>"Boat-Sail-Machine"</i> or 
		"Motor Driven Sailing Vessel" more simply called a "Motor Sailor."   
	</p>
	<p>
		Even though the engines being used in most local Indonesian craft are always of a very small size in relation to 
		the size of the vessel, per Adrian Horridge many of these engine installations seem to have resulted in the 
		demise of the vessel itself.  The presence of an engine allows the vessels to be used in ways that were not 
		possible under sail alone.  For example, the boats can now be driven against the sea and weather. The 
		resulting stress on the structure seems to have conspired to shorten the life of these motorized vessels.&nbsp;
		As a result, the presence of an engine has encouraged a number of changes, both to the hull shape, and to the 
		structure....  One extremely visible change has been to move away from the traditional "double ended" hull 
		form which we have referred to above as embodying the true 'Pinisi' type. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The KLM (motorized craft) have preserved the <strong>forward</strong> half of the traditional 'Pinisi' type, 
		complete with fore mast, gaff sail, tops'l, bowsprit and three jibs.  The fore mast and gaff are used for 
		loading and off loading cargo, as well as to hang sails as emergency propulsion in the event of engine failure.  
		Under Indonesian law, the presence of the sails allows a substantial tax break for the cargo vessels, so the 
		forward rig is likely to persist for some time to come.</p>
	<p>
		Gone though is the aft mast and sails, and in its place is a large cabin structure containing the bridge.  
		Although the bow remains virtually identical to the sailing Pinisi types, the KLM (motorized vessels) are given 
		a wide overhanging stern.  Additionally, the keel is extended farther aft in order to provide support for a 
		rudder and to provide an aperture for the propeller.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The presence of engines in this fleet of wooden vessels has forced changes to the structure as well.  In 
		addition to the usual 'wooden peg' fastened plank and frame structure, iron drifts and bolts are now used 
		throughout. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A further refinement to this would naturally be the use of hot dip galvanized bolts throughout, which oddly is 
		relatively rare in Indonesia, primarily due to its cost.  In the motorized fleet, in my view an additional 
		refinement is needed; one that would allow the structure to better handle the stresses of an engine 
		installation.  This would simply be to add substantial structural bulkheads at each end of the engine 
		space, combined with a pair of robust and long length engine bed timbers in order to spread the engine's forces 
		over a much larger portion of the hull's structure.  Although we have seen substantial bulkheads being 
		used, we have not observed any vessels with heavy duty long length engine girders. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout Indonesia, virtually all of the motorized Pinisi are vastly under-powered.  A KLM of some 35 to 
		40 meters in size will ordinarily be given an engine of somewhere around 200 hp.  This is adequate for 
		perhaps 5 knots in mild conditions.  Many of these craft are given even less power in proportion to their 
		size.  They are consequently quite slow, but very economical in terms of fuel use.  <br /> &nbsp;</p>

		<h2>The Pinisi as a Charter Yacht</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		<strong><a href="phinisi.htm">36 Meter Pinisi SI<span class="auto-style1">LOLONA</span></a>: </strong>In 2001 we were asked to design a new and improved, yet highly traditional 
		Indonesian Pinisi.  During the summer of 2001 we journeyed to Sulawesi to research these types, and then to 
		Kalimantan Selatan in order to actually loft the body view of the hull and construct mould frames to guide the 
		shape.</p>
	<p>
		The intent with this new vessel was multi-faceted. One of the primary 
		goals was to create a traditional, indigenous sailing 'Pinisi' for use 
		as a charter vessel throughout the eastern islands of Indonesia. 
		Additional goals have been to provide much greater strength and 
		longevity of structure than is lavished upon local craft. Our aim in so 
		doing has been to reduce maintenance, to provide a high degree of 
		comfort, improve the performance under power, and to increase the long 
		term safety of the ship.&nbsp; 
	</p>
	<p>
		We have used this same approach with all of the Pinisi boats we have 
		designed for construction in Indonesia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<strong><a href="30m_phinisi.htm">30 Meter P<span class="auto-style1">inisi 
		DATU BUA</span></a>:  </strong>
		Then late in 2007 we were asked to design a new 30m Pinisi that would be 
		capable under sail.  At around 250 metric tons, this is considerably smaller than the 350 ton 
		<a href="phinisi.htm">Silolona</a>, thus a much more handy and 
		affordable charter yacht.  With a focus on good sailing performance, plus a charter-friendly layout, this design holds 
		very good promise.  In 2008 with the ink barely dry on the <strong>
		<em>preliminary</em></strong> drawings and documents, construction was already 
		under way.  Yikes...!  A bit more advance planning is 
		definitely preferred.  </p>
	<p>
		<strong><a href="38m_phinisi.htm">38 Meter Pinisi AMANDIRA</a></strong>:  
		In 2009 we created a greatly improved version of the 36m Silolona.  We extended 
		the design to 38 meters on deck, added a fully capable sailing rig, and 
		provided an interior layout better suited for use as a private yacht 
		with ample room for guests.   Here, a generous owner's 
		stateroom is located aft on the main deck.&nbsp; Below forward, the guest 
		accommodations are equally divided into four luxury cabins.  In 
		late 2009, building was begun on Kalimantan. In 2015 the vessel is under 
		charter to <strong>Aman Resorts</strong>.</p>
	<p>
		<strong><a href="50m_phinisi.htm">50 Meter Sailing Pinisi</a>:  </strong>Early in 2007 we were asked to create a new 50m 
						Pinisi design that would make use of the traditional rig 'styling' but that would be much more 
						capable under sail.  You can review this design at our <a href="50m_phinisi.htm">50m 
						Pinisi</a> web page.  At around 650 metric tons, this is nearly twice as big as the 
						original 36m Pinisi.  Weighing over <strong>1.4
						million pounds</strong>, this is really quite a <strong>large</strong> 
						wooden vessel..!   <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2>The KLM as a Charter Yacht</h2>
	<p>
		<strong><a href="kapal_layar_mesin.htm">30 Meter Kapal Layar Mesin</a>:  </strong>In 2004 we were asked to develop a prototype 30 meter charter 
		yacht, which was to be based heavily upon the very common Kapal Layar Mesin types now being used to carry cargo 
		throughout Indonesia.  Please see our 
		<a href="kapal_layar_mesin.htm">30m KLM</a> web page for more 
		information on this prototype design.</p>
	<p>
		<a href="kapal_layar_mesin_33.htm"><strong>33 Meter Kapal Layar Mesin</strong></a>:  
		In 2005, we developed this design as a preliminary study which 
		eventually became the 36 meter KLM listed just below.  Slightly 
		smaller, and with lesser displacement, the power requirements would be 
		less and the overall construction more economical.</p>
	<p>
		<strong><a href="kapal_layar_mesin_36.htm">36 Meter KLM DUNIA BARU</a>:</strong>  Fairly soon after that in 2005 we were asked to develop a 
		much larger 36 meter KLM as a luxury charter yacht.  With the 
		design completed, during the summer of 2006 we went to Indonesia once 
		again in order to loft the shape and build mould frames for this new 36m KLM, 
		the <strong>Dunia Baru</strong>.  This vessel was built in Kalimantan Timur 
		from 2006 to 2008 and moved to Surabaya and Bali for completion of the 
		systems and the interior joinery.&nbsp; The <strong>Dunia Baru</strong> 
		is now fully completed (2014) and available for charters.&nbsp; You can see this design on our 
		<a href="kapal_layar_mesin_36.htm">36m KLM</a> web page.
		</p>
	<p>
		The owner's mission statement was that when finished, the <strong>Dunia 
		Baru</strong> will be the <strong>ultimate</strong> 
		example of what is possible with these craft.   This has been precisely the outcome.  It is the natural result of proper design and planning, top quality 
		indigenous boat building skills, first rate timber, hard work,
						a good business plan, and an owner dedicated to making this the very finest Indonesian 
		Pinisi in existence.  Mission 
		accomplished.</p>
	<p>
						<strong><a href="kapal_layar_mesin_50.htm">50 Meter Kapal Layar Mesin</a>:  </strong>
						We have developed a prototype
						<a href="kapal_layar_mesin_50.htm">50m KLM</a> design, also 
						aimed at charter use in Indonesia.  So far, this is a prototype design only but could 
						easily be developed to suit a new purpose, whether as a 
						charter vessel or  private yacht.<br /> &nbsp; </p>
	<h2>
						New Concepts...!</h2>
	<p>
						Most recently I have developed a series of wooden boat 
						designs that are specifically for construction in 
						Indonesia.&nbsp; These are more in the direction of the 
						hull types that would have been seen by the Indonesian 
						people when the Western ships of discovery sailed there 
						during the 1500's.&nbsp; They were the Portuguese 
						Caravelles...&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the specific vessel types that 
						inspired the following designs are the <strong>Privateers</strong> of the 
						mid to late 1700's, they are not so far removed from the 
						original Caravelles.&nbsp; In this case, they are 
						Brigantine Schooner rigged up to a length of 31 meters, 
						with the larger 45m Privateer being Barquentine Schooner 
						rigged.&nbsp; Here are the links...</p>
	<p>
						<a href="flores_privateer_56.htm"><strong>17m Flores 
						Privateer</strong></a>:&nbsp; A 56' brigantine 
						schooner designed as a private yacht for construction in 
						Indonesia with tropical hardwoods.&nbsp; Accommodations 
						for two owners, two informal guests, and four crew.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>
						<a href="sulawesi_privateer_66.htm"><strong>20m Sulawesi 
						Privateer</strong></a>: A 66' brigantine schooner 
						intended for charters, or for a couple and four guests, 
						plus a crew of four.&nbsp; Inspired by our 61' 
						Brigantine Mermaid. Designed for construction on the 
						beach in Indonesia with tropical hardwood, its cost 
						would not be much.</p>
	<p>
						<strong><a href="31m_komodo_privateer.htm">31m Komodo 
						Privateer</a></strong>:&nbsp; A 102' brigantine schooner 
						designed as a charter yacht designed for 
						construction in Indonesia.&nbsp; The objective with this 
						design has been to contain the same guest suite layout 
						as our larger 36 to 38 meter sailing Pinisi types within 
						a smaller overall hull size, for the sake of economy, 
						but without compromising the guest cabins or the degree 
						of luxury they offer.&nbsp; A secondary objective has 
						been to introduce a different design to the Indonesian 
						charter game having much less windage for the sake of 
						enhanced sailing performance. </p>
	<p>
			
			<a href="36m_lombok_privateer.htm"><strong>36m Lombok Privateer</strong></a>:&nbsp; 
						A 118' brigantine schooner intended as a dive / cultural 
						charter yacht with accommodations for up to 14 guests in 
						high luxury.&nbsp; Five spacious double cabins are 
						provided, each complete with its own private head and 
						shower.&nbsp; A gourmet galley is located on the main 
						deck, aft, and is intended for guest participation 
						family style, and for celebrity chef instruction.&nbsp; 
						The cook and guide each have a private cabin adjacent to 
						the galley, and the captain and mate have accommodations 
						on deck just forward of the bridge, with the remainder 
						of the crew below, aft.&nbsp; On the fore deck are three 
						dive kiosks for storage of tanks and other gear.&nbsp; 
						Covered open-air seating is arranged around a table aft, 
						and a seating pod is on the fore deck.&nbsp; Using our 
						'Privateer' format, all of this fits into 36 meters 
						length on deck.&nbsp; A traditional phinisi would have 
						to be at least 42 meters on deck in order to equal the 
						interior space provided...!</p>
	<p>
						<strong><a href="45m_kalimantan_privateer.htm">45m 
						Kalimantan Privateer</a></strong>:&nbsp; A 148' 
						Barquentine for charters and worldwide sailing.&nbsp; 
						Designed for ease of building in Indonesia using top 
						quality tropical hardwood.&nbsp; Accommodations in five 
						very large suites for 10 guests.&nbsp; An alternate 
						layout could provide 10 en-suite cabins for twenty 
						guests on dive adventures or sail training cruises.<br /> &nbsp;</p>

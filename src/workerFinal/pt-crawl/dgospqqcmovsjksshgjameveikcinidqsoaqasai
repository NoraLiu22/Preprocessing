in protest of the war in Gaza, dozens of student organizers began an encampment at Harvard Yard, holding protests and spending the night in tents.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Many on campus support this cause. Others oppose it, finding some of the chants offensive or even antisemitic. Harvard’s administration has \u003ca href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/4/26/dunne-encampment-harvard-statement/\">warned participants\u003c/a> that the encampment violates University guidelines, igniting debates about the regulation of protests on campus.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Listening to these conversations as an Israeli-American and a Harvard professor, I have to say: Against the backdrop of a raging war, events at Harvard seem almost inconsequential.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Whether you see Israel as brutally killing more than 30,000 Palestinians, the majority of them women and children, or as defending itself against a terrorist organization that integrates its fighters among civilians, events in the Middle East make our conversations here in Cambridge about the minutiae of time, place, and manner restrictions on public speech or the contours of academic freedom seem insignificant.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>And in some sense they are. After all, Harvard could decide tomorrow to divest from Israeli companies and boycott Israeli universities, or it could decide to double its investments in Israel and mandate that students take a class on Zionism. Neither would impact the course of the war 5,000 miles away in the slightest.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Given the scale of the war, I can understand why some protestors, convinced of the justness of their cause, choose to flout the seemingly petty rules of our university. However, sometimes breaking the rules is more performative than actually advancing the cause: Every day that the headlines focus on the antics of Harvard students is a day that they do not focus on Gaza. This is good for burnishing the activist resumes of some protestors, as well as for Benjamin Netanyahu, who much prefers to talk about \u003ca href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/4/25/benjamin-netanyahu-palestine-protest-harvard/\">antisemitic Ivy League students\u003c/a> than the turmoil within his own country. But it certainly doesn’t help the people of Gaza.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The fact that our university cannot stop this war, does not mean we don’t matter. To explain why we can make a difference, let me recount a story. When I started as an assistant professor at Princeton in 2005, shortly after moving to America from Israel, one of the first students I advised was from Iran. He was not allowed to visit my home country, nor I his, and yet in the United States, we could collaborate on computer science research and find other points of commonality as well. For example, as an observant Muslim, he often ate at Princeton Hillel because Kosher meat is typically Halal.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>In the intervening decades, I have worked with scholars of many nationalities, religions, and backgrounds. This diversity is a hallmark of the American higher education system and is part of the reason that the United States has some of the best universities in the world — Harvard included.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Approximately seven million Jews and seven million Arabs live between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Neither the chants of Harvard protestors nor those of the settlers in the West Bank will change the fact that both people are there to stay, and that the land will never be fully Arab nor fully Jewish.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Jews and Arabs will either continue the cycle of violence or find a way to peacefully coexist. While academic institutions cannot alter the current conflict, if we do our job right, Harvard-educated leaders may help create a better future for both Palestinians and Israelis.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>In an ideal world, Harvard would be a place for people of different beliefs to engage in dialogue and find solutions and common ground. Lately, though, we have become a place where people talk at each other rather than to each other.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Even when we invite speakers of opposing beliefs, they rarely share a stage. Rather, we support those with whom we already agree and protest those we oppose. The few organizations trying to preserve some semblance of discussion across difference — such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-standing-together.html\">Standing Together\u003c/a>, an organization that seeks to foster partnership between Jews and Arabs — are attacked by all sides. At Harvard, tellingly, their posters were torn down.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>We often discuss whether protest regulations and restrictions are too tough or too lax. Don’t get me wrong — these conversations are important. A university should allow vigorous expressions of opinions, even when they cause some amount of disorder. There are worse things than a few tents on a lawn.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>But the University must also balance the right to protest with the safety of its students and the ability to conduct its business. Unfortunately, no matter how lax the rules are, those on the extremes of a movement will always believe that they are made to be broken.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Ultimately, a university's culture is more important than its rules or regulations. We must all ask ourselves whether we prefer the comfort of interacting only with those who agree with us or if we came here to engage in difficult conversations.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>If it is the latter — which I sincerely hope — we must be prepared to encounter speech on campus that we find not only wrong but offensive and even hateful.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Alternatively, we could choose to retreat into our safe spaces, interacting solely with those who echo our own perspectives.

A sleepy Europe has suddenly awoken to find itself threatened. The Middle East is, again, on fire. The South China Sea is contested. Piracy on the high seas is on the rise. The global economy appears to be teetering on the brink of a crisis born of wars, the pandemic, and the consequences of, in effect, free money for years. Piles of plastic, rising sea levels, and a myriad of other changes force us to reconsider how we occupy the planet.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>New tools in biology present both promise and threat to human health.

Might we at Harvard now find ourselves in the midst of the hard reset required to support a more global Renaissance-like period?\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Harvard's role in such a cultural rebirth would be best fulfilled if it serves as a forum for the rigorous examination of competing and controversial ideas. But is Harvard organized for such a role?\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The last decade suggests the traditional architecture of academic departments, schools, and top-down initiatives won’t capitalize well on the creativity of the University’s main effort, the faculty. If a resurrection of classical learning and free debate is to happen at Harvard, we might be better served by a new organizational model.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>While the number of academic departments, at least within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, has grown over the last two decades, these focused disciplines draw headlines for impactful work less often than Harvard’s interdisciplinary institutes, which include the Broad Institute, the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>These institutes draw from across Harvard’s schools and FAS’ departments to break away from the specialized, reductionist model of academic training and research. They are also noteworthy because of their independent fundraising and more agile, responsive administration fitted to the specific needs of their faculty.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Most of these institutes, however, focus on the STEM fields. As students vote with their feet, moving away from the humanities, Harvard might consider solving these problems with institutional initiatives that are even more radically transdisciplinary — where the arts, sciences, engineering, and humanities can come together, as they did in da Vinci’s Renaissance.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>To prepare for the future, Harvard should think big. Exciting new ways to organize research and learning are a necessary step in securing its place in the post-pandemic era of new scholarship.

Silber, the controversial, pugilistic president who saved Boston University from crisis after the ’60s. Such a leader would prioritize a vision of institutional excellence over chasing popularity by adopting fleeting political trends.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Harvard’s leadership will have to be committed to restoring faculty faith in the administration, realigning its focus, and fostering a culture and ethos in which faculty support is prioritized. For their part, faculty are going to have to step up and embrace their roles as leaders and exemplars of excellence and open-mindedness. And students will have to toughen up and accept accountability for performance standards and civil behavior.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The next president will have to realize that their primary responsibility is protecting academic freedom and open inquiry on this campus. Everything else should be required to support an ecosystem that is more akin to an intellectual cage match than a campfire singalong.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Such a president will undoubtedly differ from those to which we have become accustomed. They will have to dismantle inefficiencies and neutralize influential cliques that have compromised the primary purpose and standards of this university and build new initiatives for a future that might be a century in the making.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The president, as the University’s chief cultural officer and public face, will also have to navigate an institutionally neutral Harvard in such a way that its American citizenship is not just its heritage, but its guide for the future.

But University leadership can do a great deal to change this culture and help pave the way for improvement across higher education.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>I speak at many alumni events, where graduates celebrate their years at Harvard as some of the happiest of their lives. The reason for this is easy to understand: Alumni reflect on the love they had for each other, for their former professors, and for the intellectual growth they experienced by being exposed to strange new ideas at Harvard.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>When I ask alumni how today’s Harvard differs from their own time, they often say they are baffled and saddened to see something that has replaced the love they remember: fear. They hear horror stories about “cancel culture” and angry activism directed toward ideological minorities; they read about students and professors ostracized or driven away entirely for considering impermissible ideas or holding forbidden political views. They see a narrowing range of academic freedom and empirical evidence that \u003ca href=\"https://www.thefire.org/news/harvard-gets-worst-score-ever-fires-college-free-speech-rankings\">free speech at Harvard\u003c/a> is in decline.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>This fear is real. One student who previously served in the military told me that his extensive training in war zones prepared him to deal with fear, but nothing truly rattled him until he was contemptuously denounced for his conservative views by some classmates. Before you scoff at this, note that psychologists have found that being excluded from a group is literally painful.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>In one classic experiment, participants had their brains scanned during a virtual ball-tossing game. When they were suddenly excluded from the game, there was intense activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, a limbic region associated with the experience of pain.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>This makes evolutionary sense: We should be averse to rejection to avoid behaviors that get us thrown out of our tribe and force us to wander the frozen tundra alone. Perhaps you object that there’s no frozen tundra at Harvard if you say you voted for a Republican in a class. Well, your ACC doesn’t know that.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The solution to the problem we face today is not to get rid of controversy or diminish disagreement. On the contrary, Harvard should be a marketplace of competing ideas. Agreement for the sake of agreeability is profoundly mediocre, like a market with just one product. Indeed, this is precisely the problem we face when activism trumps inquiry, creating the unchallenged ideological orthodoxy that has created the fear of disagreement in the first place.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Instead, we need heterodoxy, and even heresy — not as necessary evils to bear, but as adventures to enjoy and relish together.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>To see disagreement and heretical ideas in this way requires a cultural renewal of the love — and happiness — our alumni so fondly remember at Harvard. We should encourage those seeking orthodoxy to look elsewhere. We want joyful free thinkers who bridge courageously across profound differences of viewpoint, as opposed to bonding over in-group ideology. We seek students, faculty, and staff who thrill at ideas different than their own, and who wouldn’t think to sacrifice love and friendship at the behest of dogmatists inside or outside the university.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>This love is the antidote to fear. As the Chinese philosopher \u003ca href=\"https://terebess.hu/english/tao/yutang.html#Kap67\">Lao Tzu\u003c/a> wrote some 2,500 years ago, “Through love, one has no fear.” Five centuries later, \u003ca href=\"https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm\">Saint John the Apostle\u003c/a> said the same: “There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear.”\u003c/p>","\u003cp>And today, neuroscience supports Lao Tzu and Saint John. For example, the neuropeptide oxytocin reduces anxiety by lowering activity in the amygdala — the limbic structure dedicated to processing fearful and threatening stimuli. Oxytocin, sometimes called the “love hormone,” bonds us with others through (among other things) eye contact, touch, and warm interactions.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The problems we face don’t appear overnight, and neither will their solutions. To repair the damage done by the culture of fear, a proactive emphasis on happiness itself could help.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Student experiences and required readings could focus on positive psychology and related disciplines. Courses in these areas could be integrated into the undergraduate curriculum, as well as specialized fields from medicine to law. In my own experience teaching happiness here at Harvard Business School, studying the science and learning the habits that promote wellbeing brings out the very best in my students.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Perhaps there is a risk in all this, though: I can easily imagine the withering mockery from sophisticates outside our community at Harvard leadership’s newfound focus on love and happiness. We might even face a bit of tribal rejection in academia, which will give our own ACCs a little twinge.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>But I have a prediction: They will follow.

Parts of it are true.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Once upon a time, there was a university named “Harvard,” located just outside of Boston. Harvard was an old university – at least, as Americans measure such things. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, it maintained a well-earned reputation as one of the world’s premier research institutions.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Partly for that reason, and partly because of the rather less admirable ways in which it had entrenched itself in powerful political and economic institutions, it attracted a remarkably talented group of students to its undergraduate program and the programs run by its various professional schools.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Harvard maintained its reputation in part by following very rigorous practices when it came to hiring new faculty and promoting existing faculty to tenure. As part of these practices, candidates were required to submit many items including a document describing their approach to teaching.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>So far, the story is true. Now let’s continue with our story of Other Harvard.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Recently, Other Harvard found itself embroiled in controversy, centered on those very hiring and promotion practices. Angry voices, both inside and outside its walls, denounced specific aspects of Harvard’s practices as betrayals of the core values of academic freedom and open, unfettered inquiry.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>What was the focus of this outrage? Just this: the requirement that candidates for hiring or promotion include, as part of their dossier, a statement describing their approach to teaching.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Huh? Has Other Harvard gone mad? After all, maintaining excellence in teaching is – surely – central to its mission. What could be wrong about asking candidates to describe their approach to education?\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The trouble started about 10 years earlier, when a set of ideas about teaching that had, until that point, been safely confined to remote, post-modernism-infested corners of academia, began to break out into the mainstream. One began to hear pronouncements like: “The teacher who refuses to interrogate the structures of oppression within which they operate will merely reproduce those structures in their classroom”; “the best teachers enable students to find their own truths”; “the very distinction between ‘teacher’ and ‘student’ enacts systemic violence.” Worse, the radical theories lurking behind such pronouncements began to affect college and university governance.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>More and more institutions of higher education created equity-based teaching offices, with the power to force faculty to undergo mandatory training and even to change their teaching in concrete ways. Some instructors have even gone so far as to grant students a formalized role in selecting syllabus material, narrowly limit the use of exams, and avoid entirely certain kinds of grading practices.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The notorious “\u003ca href=\"https://ofew.berkeley.edu/academic-recruitment/contributions-deib/sample-rubric-assessing-candidate-contributions-diversity\">Berkeley rubric\u003c/a>” for evaluating teaching statements contained the startling advice that candidates should receive a low score for saying anodyne things like it’s important to them to treat their students equally.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>No wonder people were getting mad. A backlash was brewing across the country, and while Harvard had been spared the worst of the equity-based teaching excesses (thanks to a hardy strain of crusty traditionalism), one focus of the local backlash was those damn teaching statements. They had to go!\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Backlash does not, alas, lend itself to clear and nuanced thinking. If we could transport ourselves to Other Harvard, we might counsel our colleagues to calm down, and direct their anger at its proper target: not those damn teaching statements, but rather the horribly distorted view about what they should contain.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>“After all,” we might say to those colleagues, “surely you agree that high-quality teaching is an incredibly important part of your mission? Isn’t the issue really that you all need to reaffirm a healthy understanding of what it is?”\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Maybe we could convince them to agree. However, backlash-induced outrage can be an intoxicating drug, and some of our Other Colleagues might not want to kick the habit. To be fair, they might offer up thoughtful reasons for thinking that it ain’t really that easy. Maybe the best course was to get rid of teaching statements entirely until a proper “reset” could occur.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Now let’s return home. All of us at Real Harvard, ought to recognize a certain vision of our teaching mission as one to live up to. I’m partial to the vision of the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard, of which I am a member: “A university must train students and teachers to engage across disagreement, learning to treat with intellectual seriousness and honesty the wide range of ideas and perspectives that live within our diverse community.”\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Suppose you agree. Then you should also agree on the value of diversity: After all, training students and teachers to engage across disagreement requires, well, disagreement.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>But building a diverse community isn’t enough. The members of that community need to experience it as one to which they genuinely belong, as a single community in which all are included equally, with – crucially – equal standing to have their voices taken up, responded to, and engaged with.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>None of this should be news; indeed, just six years ago a Harvard task force produced a brilliant document – “\u003ca href=\"https://inclusionandbelongingtaskforce.harvard.edu/files/inclusion/files/harvard_inclusion_belonging_task_force_final_report_full_web_180327.pdf\">Pursuing Excellence on a Foundation of Inclusion\u003c/a>” – articulating and defending such values as diversity and inclusion as inextricably linked to our core educational mission.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>So why wouldn’t we ask candidates for hiring and promotion for their thoughts about how they try to realize and live up to these values? Remember the counsel we gave our Other Colleagues: Isn’t the issue really that we all need to reaffirm a healthy understanding of these values?\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Yes. Of course that is the issue. Furor over diversity statements in hiring is a red herring. I share my colleague professor Randall L.Kennedy’s anger.

Too often, the horrifying consequence of such total self-surety is the demonization of nonbelievers and the adoption of “coercive measures that range from banishment from public life to [...] physical annihilation.”\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The consequences of fascism and communism are — or at least should be — well known. But there is more to consider. For most of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, Europe was engaged in a series of devastating religious wars. The Thirty Years’ War, for example, is estimated to have resulted in the death of a third of Germany’s population. Today, we witness the carnage in Palestine and Israel, the result of a conflict that goes back more than a century, now fueled by the religious zealotry of Israel’s right and Hamas, both of which are certain that God has promised them the totality of the region’s territory\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Recent political strife in the United States has also led to people being killed, as in Charlottesville, V.A.

At times, it has, including in response to the murder of George Floyd and the war in Ukraine. Countering these calls, there has been recent debate about whether Harvard should remain neutral on political matters unless the issues involved threaten the very mission of the University. In the present context, this debate is arguably analogous as to those about whether a nation should have a state religion.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>My plea in these contentious times is that we at least tolerate each other — that we resist the urge to deplatform, attack, punish, and censor — even if we can’t find it within ourselves to listen to those we deeply disagree with, much less understand and respect their views.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>As Bertrand Russel argues: “In this world, which is getting more and more closely interconnected, we have to learn to tolerate each other, we have to learn to put up with the fact that some people say things that we don’t like.

We should not allow the present sense of crisis to foster hasty policymaking on an issue of this importance.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The Kalven Report, promulgated in 1967 by the University of Chicago, is the flagship institutional neutrality document and has been invoked in recent days as an example for Harvard to follow. It sets a presumption that the University will not express “opinions on the political and social issues of the day” or modify “its corporate activities to foster social or political values.”\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The Kalven Principles also state, however, that the presumption of neutrality can be overcome in two instances: when the “very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry” come under threat, and when the institution “must act” as a corporate body, for instance when it owns property, receives funds, or bestows honors.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Thus, the goal of institutional neutrality is actually the achievement of political neutrality in the statements and decisions of top leadership. In reality, such neutrality can be vanishingly difficult to identify.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The Kalven principles can be swallowed by their exceptions. Under Kalven, both verbal statements and corporate activities should be kept free of political values and issues. But the University is making a statement about climate change when it fails to divest itself of stock in oil and gas enterprises. It needn’t go so far as to verbally refuse to do so. The problem cannot be avoided by adding a provision requiring that any decision that the University makes on this issue must be financially advisable: That narrowing of investment strategy is itself politically contested.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Thus, on climate divestment, there seems to be no politically neutral position. In Kalven’s terms, the University “must act” as a corporate body, on an issue involving “social and political values,” no matter what it does.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>The same is true of the U.S. Supreme Court’s rejection of Harvard’s use of racial classifications in its undergraduate admissions processes. It is true of the institution’s handling of charges of antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus; of the scope of its diversity, inclusion, and belonging programming; even of its bargaining with worker unions.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Harvard as a corporate body has to take positions on all of these issues. These decisions thus fall directly in the second Kalven exception. And yet all of them have politics: They all make statements on “social or political values.” Any statement, and any silence — any action, any inaction — can be deemed political.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>I would also argue that all of Gay’s statements on controversies set in motion by the Hamas invasion of Israel on Oct. 7 were aimed at defending the University from increasingly intense threats to its very mission. This is true whether the mission was merely securing the safety of all members of our community or the more academic goal of furthering teaching and research on the Israel-Palestine conflict, a difficult task given that an actual armed conflict is underway and members of our community have taken opposing stances on it.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>An institutional neutrality principle for Harvard would give top leadership cover when they keep their lips sealed in the face of political forces demanding that Harvard take a stand on partisan issues. But complying with the Kalven presumption against taking a position could coincide with actions by which the institution does take a stand. Where the University both invokes a neutrality mandate and takes corporate action, the result will not be neutrality but non-transparency. Institutional neutrality could become institutional deception.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Finally, the Kalven Report provides that faculty, students, and administrators can “question” whether “the University is playing its proper role” through “existing channels.” Within Harvard, I have heard calls for a complaint procedure, albeit not one that could lead to sanctions. As anyone who has been involved in defending academic freedom on campuses in recent years knows, the investigation alone can be the punishment.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>In Harvard’s current politically polarized environment, complaints are sure to be raised about the most “neutral” statement touching even tangentially on a politically divisive issue. If institutional neutrality is rendered enforceable, even by investigation and moral disapprobation, we will be inviting political conflict into the very heart of the institution.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Institutional neutrality will be weaponized, and the good faith of those who invoke it will be unverifiable. Any of this would be entirely counterproductive, given the apparent goals of those calling for neutrality at Harvard.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>There are other things we can do to harden the University to the present sense of siege. We can urge leadership to remember that they represent an ideologically diverse community that is, at times like Oct. 7 and its aftermath, in need of compassionate representation across a wide range of views. They are empowered to run the University, not the moral lives of all its human and institutional members: They need to learn modesty in messaging.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>We can revisit governance to make top leadership more accountable to faculty. We can reconsider financing strategies for the University that put it at the mercy of ideologically-driven outside donors. We can promote academic freedom and resilient listening in our community’s intellectual and political life.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>That last is the goal of the new Council for Academic Freedom at Harvard.

They think legacy admissions policies privilege this demographic and negatively affect minorities and the needy. But it’s not so clear who legacies are. Is a legacy the child of any Harvard graduate, or only a wealthy one? Or does legacy status only matter if you’re the scion of several generations of Harvard graduates — Harvard blueblood, in other words? Does it include the daughters and granddaughters of our Black and Hispanic graduates, who are rather numerous and often quite wealthy?\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Even if you define legacy as “wealthy graduate,” the question arises: just how wealthy?\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Contrary to popular belief, it’s not the case that all Harvard graduates become rich and famous. Some become schoolteachers or cellists or aid workers in foreign countries, surviving on a pittance. Sometimes the children of the rich and famous aren’t as rich and famous as their parents. I’ve known a few cases of that happening in my 38 years at Harvard. Should their children then be branded with the infamous label of “legacy?” If the children of all Harvard graduates are legacies, surely it’s absurd to disadvantage them in the admissions process.\u003c/p>","\u003cp>And does the university really want to abandon families that have served it for generations and maintain its traditions?

Isn’t it the case that one reason less advantaged people aspire to get into Harvard is to meet fellow students from influential families who might be able to help them get on in life? If the goal of our admissions policies should be to help disadvantaged students enter the ruling class, won’t it help such students if they can network with classmates who are already members of that class?\u003c/p>","\u003cp>A few years back, the Harvard administration, filled with a sense of its own righteousness, decided to impose sanctions on members of single-sex final clubs.

So let’s raise the question again: Who should private universities turn to for support? Foreign donors, some of them silent partners of foreign governments, who are trying to buy access to research and exercise political influence?

(I recognize the arguments for including race, but that has been judged unconstitutional, so the issue is moot.)\u003c/p>","\u003cp>Why should test scores be given the greatest weight?

<h1>Reliability and Validity of IPIP Scales</h1>
<h2>Reliability</h2>
<p>Cronbach alpha reliability estimates are available for all of
the IPIP scales on this site. These reliability estimates are based on
responses of the <a href="ESCS_TechnicalReport_January2016.pdf">Eugene-Springfield
Community Sample</a>. These coefficient alpha values can
generally be found in two locations. On Web pages that show scoring
keys (for example, <a href="30FacetNEO-PI-RItems.htm">
the scoring key for Johnson's 30 IPIP-NEO facet scales</a>),
coefficient alpha is listed in parentheses or brackets at the beginning
of each scale.</p>
<p>Alpha reliability coefficients are also listed in the
comparison tables that present statistics on IPIP scales and the
measures on which they were based. For multi-construct IPIP
inventories, links to all available comparison tables are listed on the
<a href="newMultipleconstructs.htm">multi-construct
inventory page</a>. A comparison table for all single constructs
can be found on the <a href="newSingleConstructs.htm">single
constructs page</a>.</p>
<h2>Validity</h2>
<p>Because many IPIP scales were designed to measure constructs
similar to those in existing personality inventories, a primary form of
validity is the correlation between the IPIP scale and the scale on
which it was based. These correlations can be found in the comparison
tables described above.</p>
<p>For additional information on the validity of IPIP scales, one
must go beyond this site to locate studies which have employed the
scale. A partial list of such studies is available on the <a href="newPublications.htm">Publications Page</a>.</p>

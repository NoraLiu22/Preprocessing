One piece that stuck with me was \u003ca href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2023/10/20/ghostwriter-ai-drake-weeknd-billboard-grammy-essay\"\u003eVivian Medithi’s column on an AI-assisted Drake and The Weeknd deep-fake\u003c/a\u003e, which Vivian described as cold, contemptuous, and fundamentally devoid of value: after listening to it, they wrote, “the difference between a fake and the real deal becomes strikingly clear.” The internet keeps filling up with music and writing that feels like those weird non-ideas of non-food, things that nobody wants, and we keep being told it’s the future.\n\nThe FADER’s favorite albums of the year, as always, come from wildly disparate parts of the world, traversing genres and aesthetics. What unites them all is that they started with human ideas and were crafted by human minds and communicated something to other humans — not least the people listed above. Unlike the pablum spat out by algorithms and chatbots, the real-life creativity of the 100+ artists, 19 writers and editors, and one graphic designer on this page represents a future of music that’s unpredictable, weird, and thrillingly alive. — \u003ci\u003eAlex Robert Ross, Editorial Director\u003c/i\u003e\n                   [INSERT_AD]                    50.

MIKE, on the other hand, seems to draw from a bottomlessly fascinating well of inspiration when he creates, taking his art to surprising places with each new release. At 24 tracks — 22 of them self-produced and none phoned in — \u003ci\u003eBurning Desire\u003c/i\u003e is a multileveled maze, but its warmth transcends the inscrutability often implied by such density. The record’s hand-crafted ethos is most evident on songs like “plz don’t cut my wings,” a cut so purely MIKE that Earl Sweatshirt feels more like an extension of his host than his own entity on his guest verse, and “THEY DON’T STOP IN THE RAIN,” which he kicks off with a memory of forging on through storm clouds to finish a set at his Young World III festival this past summer.  To take in the whole album in one sitting is to reckon with the full force of MIKE’s immeasurable skill — a gentle, quiet power that expands with every passing minute. — \u003ci\u003eRaphael Helfand\u003c/i\u003e\n       49. Samia, \u003ci\u003eHoney\u003c/i\u003e            Inside jokes riddle Samia’s sticky-sweet mess of a second album, ultra-personal anecdotes exploding into at-times-painfully relatable lyrical narratives. “Your mom keeps threatening suicide on holidays,” she sings on “Pink Balloon,” before expanding into the vagaries of friendship: “And whether it’s a fallacy / You sing of love persistently / Sometimes when you sing to me / I still believe I know you.” It’s the same on the title track, where Samia sings about wanting to be a mermaid as a way of saying she’s “not scared to be naked / I’m not scared of anything.” Samia’s specificity invites listeners to superimpose themselves into her world and identify the universal behind the personal. \u003ci\u003eHoney\u003c/i\u003e’s sonic universe is as unusual as it is pleasing — a combination of waifish vocals, gritty garage-pop beat loops, dreamy synth pads catalyzed by Samia’s girl-next-door charm — and it’s always as raw as the album’s most screamable lyric: “I hope you marry the girl from your hometown / And I’ll fucking kill her, and I’ll fucking freak out.” \u003ci\u003eHoney\u003c/i\u003e is Samia’s ultimate love letter to the awkward, a clashing embrace of optimism and reality, and, above all, a testament to the pleasure she takes in turning existential crises into really catchy music. — \u003ci\u003eLila Dubois\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    48. bar italia, \u003ci\u003eTracey Denim\u003c/i\u003e            bar italia were reduced to a mosaic of references as they emerged from the London underground in 2023, compared lazily to almost every band from the Velvet Underground to Slowdive to Pulp, as if the whole project was some kind of ironic pastiche. But \u003ci\u003eTracey Denim\u003c/i\u003e, the first of two albums they released on the massive indie Matador this year, isn’t delivered from some icy remove; these are brooding, immediate, supple rock songs about disconnection and disappointment. Even on the first half of the record, where the mixes are more minimal and the melodies cooler, there’s a breadth to the songwriting, tracks like “punkt” bristling with post-punk anxiety before exhaling into the somnolent bliss of “my kiss era.” And on the back half, they really open up: “Friends” is a grin-inducing, fuzzed-out two-minute alt-rock song, while closer “maddington” is breathy, cinematic, and sweetly imperfect. Way more fun than a conversation about their forebears. — \u003ci\u003eARR\u003c/i\u003e       47. Kara Jackson, \u003ci\u003eWhy Does the Earth Give Us People to Love?\u003c/i\u003e            It takes conviction and clarity of vision to create a debut album as fully formed as Kara Jackson’s. For the singer-songwriter and former National Youth Poet Laureate from Chicago, adamance is her resting state, whether she’s \u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7QnY3RVwHE\"\u003eswerving fuccbois\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QMvFbFTy84\"\u003egrieving the loss of a loved one\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://x.com/fridahalo/status/1690364227834277890?s=20\"\u003eprotecting the safety of fans at her concerts\u003c/a\u003e. \u003ci\u003eWhy Does the Earth Give Us People to Love?\u003c/i\u003e is a record that practices and preaches without ever feeling practiced or preachy. Couched within its slyly sprawling compositions are perfect little jewels of metaphor. On “no fun/party,” Jackson wishes for a love “as tough as elephant tusk,” and on “pawnshop,” she laments a lover who left her feeling “permanent as a party balloon.” There’s not much joy to be found within Jackson’s forlorn blues, but she offers us the same gift as Fiona Apple famously did with her “\u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42gNkySFycA\"\u003eThis world is bullshit\u003c/a\u003e” speech. Everybody knows the pain of love and loss, of being had and not held, but few of us have the strength to turn those emotions into great art. By dipping her pen in her own blood, Jackson saves us the labor of doing the same. — \u003ci\u003eWalden Green\u003c/i\u003e\n       46. Jim Legxacy, \u003cI\u003eHNPM\u003c/i\u003e             Jim Legxacy understands that the resonant part of a genre is not the way something sounds but, rather, how the music makes you feel. Yes, \u003cI\u003eHNPM\u003c/i\u003e incorporates elements of drill, Afrobeats, and Midwest emo, but it isn’t simply an eclectic playlist set to shuffle. The same yearning and vulnerability that is present on “candy reign (!),” an Afrobeats song complete with a gospel choir, is there on “old place,” where the story of Legxacy reuniting with an ex finds space between mathy guitars and Jersey club drums. “block hug,” meanwhile, undercuts the hard-boiled street narratives of drill by starting off with twinkly acoustics that would have you swearing he left Fleet Foxes running in the studio. The streaming era has ushered in a glut of genre-agnostic albums built to be dispersed into the playlist ecosystem. \u003cI\u003eHNPM\u003c/i\u003e bucks the trend by presenting its wide-ranging sonic ambition as a whole, while remaining a consistent and revealing portrait of its creator. — \u003ci\u003eDavid Renshaw\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    45. Gia Margaret, \u003ci\u003eRomantic Piano\u003c/i\u003e            Gia Margaret’s career was forced off course almost as soon as it started. Having lost her voice touring her softly folky 2018 debut, \u003ci\u003eThere’s Always Glimmer\u003c/i\u003e, the Chicago singer-songwriter and classically trained pianist turned to her synthesizer as a form of therapy on her exploratory and almost entirely instrumental 2020 follow-up, \u003ci\u003eMia Gargaret\u003c/i\u003e. She keeps following that path on her third album, stripping her sound back even further, nodding to composer-pianists like the pre-minimalist Erik Satie and the uniquely virtuosic Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou. She goes further than the playfully plain album title suggests, drifting constantly between textures and tones, from the sedative “Hinoki Wood” through the throbbing drone that serves as a canvas on “Ways of Seeing” and the muffled heartbeat on the trip-hop-pop song “La langue de l’amitié.” The world Margaret builds with so few elements is so remarkably vivid that it makes the one moment when her voice does interject, on the perfectly restrained centerpiece “City Song,” all the more powerful. \u003ci\u003eRomantic Piano\u003c/i\u003e is proof that, for great composers, the medium is not the message. — \u003ci\u003eARR\n\u003c/i\u003e       44. Asake, \u003ci\u003eWork of Art\u003c/I\u003e            Asake’s \u003ci\u003eWork Of Art\u003c/i\u003e is a polychromatic ode to his upward mobility and a new lease on life. Many would take a breather after a stunning debut like 2022’s \u003ci\u003eMr. Money with the Vibe\u003c/i\u003e, but on his quickfire 2023 sophomore album, the singer picks up where he left things and drastically ups the scales while attempting to situate his music in the same rarified air as high art. Much like \u003ci\u003eMMWTV\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eWork Of Art\u003c/i\u003e plays frenetically, propelled by super-producer Magicsticks’s deft fusion of amapiano, rock, Fújì, and hip-hop. Taking inspiration from the work and life of Jean-Michel Basquiat, \u003ci\u003eWork Of Art\u003c/i\u003e colorfully details Asake’s successes and the breakthroughs he has experienced in rich strokes. He explores his syncretic spiritual leanings on “Olorun'' and “Awodi,” and cathartically pulls back the layers on isolation as a consequence of fame on tracks like “Lonely At The Top” and “Yoga.” Still, \u003ci\u003eWork Of Art\u003c/i\u003e is an album primarily crafted to get people in the spirit of a good time, and it still serves that purpose with a roll call of hits like “2:30,” “Basquiat,” and the Grammy Award-nominated “Amapiano.” By dexterously blending his deep spiritual reflections with party music, Asake reveals himself as the rare popstar keenly aware of every step in his journey and what it takes to reach his destination. — \u003ci\u003eWale Oloworekende\u003c/i\u003e\n       43. Nourished By Time, \u003ci\u003eErotic Probiotic 2\u003c/i\u003e            Nourished By Time is the moniker of Baltimore-born Marcus Brown, an artist adept at extracting elements from music’s past and creating something uniquely individual. Brown, a former  Berklee College of Music student, pinpoints early-’90s R\u0026B as a touchstone — a hinterland between new jack swing and neo soul, where the trail of one decade faded into the start of another. This interest in hybrid times informs \u003cI\u003eErotic Probiotic 2\u003c/i\u003e, an album that blends these sounds with deep house, soul, Baltimore club, and multiple forms of outsider guitar music into something you can always dance to. The groove is God here, and Brown sits between the beats, sometimes using their rich baritone simply to keep the vibe going (“Soap Party”) and others to rail against the establishment. “Once or twice I prayed to Jesus / Never heard a word back in plain English / More like signs or advertisements / Telling me to keep consumerizing,” Brown sings on “The Fields,” a track that feels like the midpoint between Jam \u0026 Lewis and the anarcho-futurist critic Mark Fisher. It’s to Brown’s credit that this melange of influences doesn’t get lost in reverence, instead shining as a passion project made from equal parts heart and craft. — \u003ci\u003eDR\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    42. Kelela, \u003ci\u003eRaven\u003c/i\u003e            \nDespite how often Kelela sings the phrase “far away” across its 15 tracks, \u003ci\u003eRaven\u003c/i\u003e is a deeply intimate album that suggests the nearest dance floor is a perfect space for catharsis. Over drum and bass, UKG, and dancehall, Kelela pushes you to move through your deepest desires, with collaborators like Kaytranada, BAMBII, and Junglepussy alongside her. Kelela’s dexterous, honey-filled voice pours into every corner of the album’s sometimes gritty production: “On the Run” sees her layered harmonies trickle over a bouncy dancehall riddim, while “Fooley” pairs her breathy echoes with chopped-up samples of her own voice. For all of \u003ci\u003eRaven\u003c/i\u003e’s levity, Kelela is intentional about holding space for Black queer womanhood. “They tried to break her, there’s nothing here to mourn / Took all my labor, don’t tell me that I’m strong,” she sings on the album’s title track. After grappling with writer’s block in the six years since 2017’s \u003ci\u003eTake Me Apart\u003c/i\u003e, Kelela made \u003ci\u003eRaven\u003c/i\u003e worth the wait. — \u003ci\u003eSajae Elder\u003c/i\u003e       41. Laurel Halo, \u003ci\u003eAtlas\u003c/i\u003e            The fluid, diaphanous compositions on \u003ci\u003eAtlas\u003c/i\u003e unfurl like a scroll of incense wisping toward a colder atmosphere. Laurel Halo’s fifth studio album undulates through ambient fieldscapes as orchestras both digital and analog hover overhead, fluttering in and out of earshot like birdsong. A record store would likely file the vinyl under classical or electronic, but Halo’s hypnagogic fantasia might slot best in the soundtrack section. \u003ci\u003eAtlas\u003c/i\u003e turns minutes into minor eternities, like touching the bottom of the pool or falling asleep in the grass. Halo’s first solo album since 2018’s \u003ci\u003eRaw Silk Uncut Wood\u003c/i\u003e was borne out of a period of stillness following several years of heavy touring; when interviewed about the album’s creation, she’s described reacquainting herself with the piano at an artists’ residency cut short by the pandemic and blending together the improvisatory techniques of jazz with those of medieval and Renaissance-era music. Vocal stacks and acousmatic flourishes alike are gently nestled between harmonic progressions and liminal fuzz. At times, the pain-staking beauty of \u003ci\u003eAtlas\u003c/i\u003e approximates the surreptitious thrill of watching a pianist rehearse while they think they’re alone — the self-contained intimacy of a pleasurable secret. — \u003ci\u003eVivian Medithi\u003c/i\u003e\n       40. Anysia Kym and Jadasea, \u003ci\u003ePressure Sensitive\u003c/i\u003e            On this joint project, New York producer Anysia Kym and London MC Jadasea wanted to bridge the gap between Black British and American culture in the ‘90s. The resulting album does that and more: It’s a disorientating and dazzling tour through hazed-out footwork, noxious ambient rap, and glamorous hip-house, the pair settling on a palette that sounds like 10 different radio transmissions locking into perfect harmony. This is deeply internal club music, powered by scintillating breakbeats and abrasive samples, Jadasea’s rough-hewn voice always finding its way through Kym’s left-field, widely influenced production. More often than not, it sounds as if Kym’s drums are attempting to smother Jadasea: fractured boom-bap pushing him beneath a rising tide on “Darling,” elastic sub-bass drowning him out like reverberations from the construction site next door on “Nothing Comes to a Sleeper But a Dream.” The effect is that of a rap record first heard in a dream: a slippery, ephemeral moment that you’re always trying to claw back. — \u003ci\u003eShaad D’Souza\u003c/i\u003e       39. jonatan leandoer96, \u003ci\u003eSugar World\u003c/i\u003e            The jonatan leandoer96 side project initially felt like more of a hobby for Yung Lean, an outlet to escape the baggage of perception that he’s struggled to overcome as a rapper, blowing off steam with deliberately sparse compositions. But on \u003ci\u003eSugar World\u003c/i\u003e, he transforms from a lo-fi noodler in the mode of Dean Blunt to a full-fledged art-pop star, reintroducing himself as a schmaltzy crooner. Frederik Valentin’s production is glittering and lush, positioning Lean as an almost Jarvis Cocker-like talent constructing a loving pastiche of pop music’s past. Though he’s often been dismissed as a novelty artist, there’s a real sincerity to Lean’s songwriting, and the sweeping wall of sound on \u003ci\u003eSugar World\u003c/i\u003e highlights that heartfelt sentimentality. — \u003ci\u003eNadine Smith\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    38.

Instead, it’s 27 minutes of dumping — a tape of noodly raps for listeners passionate about the intricacies of language. Mach and his partner in crime Tha God Fahim are a fire-and-ice combo: Mach engages in slippery flows with double and triple meanings, often switching from Creole to English on a dime. Fahim, meanwhile, keeps things grounded, hammering home no-nonsense similes like a ‘97 Wu affiliate’s fever dream. Production-wise, SadhuGold, Nicholas Craven, Fortes, and Denmark Vassey offer everything from easy-listening soul to musty cassette chops, balancing luxury and griminess in equal measure while leaving plenty of empty space for Mach’s wisdom and Fahim’s off-kilter comparisons. At this point, it would have been easy for Mach to leave this kind of tape behind to focus solely on brand-building exercises, so it’s a blessing to hear him and Fahim continue to innovate and experiment with rap’s form and structure, finding new ways to shit talk while dropping jewels for listeners on the hunt for deeper meaning. — \u003ci\u003eSon Raw\u003c/i\u003e       37. jaimie branch, \u003ci\u003eFly or Die Fly or Die Fly or Die ((world war))\u003c/i\u003e            jaimie branch’s third Fly or Die album throbs with life. These nine tracks are jaimie’s last songs, recorded in the months before her tragic 2022 passing at the age of 39, and they transport us back to the world she occupied: a world where the good fight raged on at ground level, but also one where there was always room for torrential love and thunderous joy. The project rests on the pillars of its reinforced bookends: the tentative groove of “borealis dancing” paired with the more confident strut of “bolinko bass,” and the defiant fight song “burning gray” mirroring the righteous war chant “take over the world,” bounded by the album’s budding opener “aurora rising” and its doomsaying closer, “world war ((reprise)).” Each of these tracks shows a different element of branch’s life force — brash and resilient but also introspective and prone to dark ruminations on the cruelty of our world — while “baba louie,” the record’s sprawling centerpiece, feels delivered from beyond the grave. Here, Branch stands on the roof of the towering structure she’s built, surveying the void below with a reassuring grin. — \u003ci\u003eRH\u003c/i\u003e\n       36. mark william lewis, \u003ci\u003eLiving\u003c/i\u003e            In UK singer-songwriter mark william lewis’s only music video, a blurry figure runs down an empty street carrying a duffle bag. From what? Toward whom? Mysteries abound, but the clip feels urgent. Given that lewis exists in the orbit of Dean Blunt’s World Music label, alongside collaborators like Nina Cristante of bar italia, it's unsurprising that little is known about him. The anonymity feels fitting when you consider the eight tracks on his debut LP, \u003ci\u003eLiving\u003c/i\u003e. Elliptical and opaque yet deceptively intimate, these songs reveal their emotional truths gradually. The loping pace of “Enough” mirrors the existential heaviness that he sings of — he traces the contours of a downcast headspace as distant guitar plods and sputters. In the haze, it’s easy to see yourself reflected, the outline of a soul in struggle peering back in a fogged mirror. — \u003ci\u003eColin Joyce\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    35. Diego Raposo, \u003ci\u003eYO NO ERA ASÍ PERO DE AHORA EN ADELANTE, SÍ\u003c/i\u003e            Hailing from the Dominican Republic, producer Diego Raposo’s experimental debut is a genrefuck pastiche that carves out exciting new paths for Latin alternative. He plays with high BPMs tinged with goth flow (“EL UNDERGROUND,” where fellow Dominican vocalist mediopicky seduces a lover like a vampire), distorted vocals wrapped in pop punk guitar riffs (“A\u0026R”), mélanges of jungle, hyperpop and rock (groundbreaking “AL CONTRARIO” with Chilean trapera AKRIILA), and so much more. \u003ci\u003eYO NO ERA ASÍ PERO DE AHORA EN ADELANTE, SÍ\u003c/i\u003e runs the gamut of Latin music’s new vanguard, from Venezuelan Miami producer MJ Nebreda on sparse “EN LA DISCO” to Mexico’s queer alt heartthrob Blue Rojo, whose heavily Auto-Tuned voice opens the album on emotive “19.322239, - 68.540659,” coordinates that point to a spot northeast of Raposo’s native Quisqueya. The idea of “Latin music” is often a general stand-in for anything that sounds a little like reggaeton, but this album makes strides toward a wider-spanning definition, one that celebrates and honors all of South America and the Caribbean's cultural movements and sounds. It's an exciting potential future, and Diego Raposo holds the key to unlocking it. — \u003ci\u003eE.R. Pulgar\u003c/i\u003e\n       34. Noname, \u003ci\u003eSundial\u003c/i\u003e            Noname’s music has always been a Trojan Horse. Her beats are built around Gospel choirs and sparse jazz samples, her flows knotty but conversational, the tone always apparently laid back. But her message is revolution, as personal as it is political. On \u003ci\u003eSundial\u003c/i\u003e, her first album in five years, she aims a sharp look at, among others, an audience less interested in her art than her suffering (“Casual white fans, who invented the voyeur? / Fascinated with mourning, they hope the trauma destroy her”), Barack Obama (“first Black president, and he the one who bombed us”), and hypocrites (“All that eat the rich, tax the rich, y'all ain't really about that shit”). But, crucially, she doesn’t fake perfection. Her messiness is there in the fabric of the record itself (however exhausting the discourse around the Jay Electronica feature on “balloons” might have been, for Noname if nobody else, it wasn’t empty shock). But it’s in Noname’s head too, not least when she raps about Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna soundtracking the “war machine” by playing the Super Bowl, on “namesake,” and Noname’s own subsequent decision to play at Coachella anyway, as if that’s not got its own litany of problems: “Somehow I still fell in line, fuck.” Lesser revolutionaries might pitch themselves as flawless, but Noname knows better. — \u003ci\u003eARR\u003c/i\u003e\n       33. yeule, \u003ci\u003esoftscars\u003c/i\u003e            Nat Ćmiel’s work as yeule across their previous albums, \u003ci\u003eSerotonin II\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eGlitch Princess\u003c/i\u003e, explored the limitations of the body as a physical space, embracing the boundaryless freedom of being a cyborg entity. On \u003ci\u003esoftscars\u003c/i\u003e, they continue to embrace the liberating autonomy of the digital form, but their emotional affectations are felt with an unsettling amount of sheer physicality — grisly, guttural, tear-stained, and soaked in blood. “Don't you feel so pure when you don't have a body anymore?” they ask on “bloodbunny,” but even after transcending into a digital form that is shapeless, \u003ci\u003esoftscars\u003c/i\u003e breathes with mortality and human tactility: black holes, rotten daisies, porcelain skin, bloody mess, bloody hands, tasting like candy. Perhaps there is nothing more human than re-connecting with the art that made you realize you were capable of feeling; the production of softscars is inspired by the soundtracks yeule grew up with, from Smashing Pumpkins to Avril Lavigne, shoegaze to nu-metal and MySpace emo. Lyrically, nothing is taboo: yeule has demons that are both flesh and disembodied, artificial and emotional. But cyborgs bleed, too, and to have scars is to understand that you are truly alive, digital or not. — \u003ci\u003eCady Siregar\n\u003c/i\u003e      [INSERT_AD]                    32. Jlin, \u003ci\u003ePerspective\u003c/i\u003e            Despite being one of footwork’s most criminally underrated producers, Jlin’s been able to garner the recognition she deserves within the world of contemporary classical music, where her percussive, club-informed minimalism is a much-needed breath of fresh air. This remains true on her awe-inspiring mini-album \u003ci\u003ePerspective\u003c/i\u003e, where she transforms her Pulitzer Prize-nominated compositions with Chicago’s Third Coast Percussion into six dizzying, dazzling recorded tracks that are propulsive experiments in texture, timbre, and timing. Take “Paradigm,” an opener that immediately confronts listeners with an onslaught of mutating polyrhythms and phrentic frequencies. Or the moment in “Obscure” when a classic juke sample starts to destabilize before erupting into an eye-widening cascade of competing sounds that seem to catch themselves mid-air. Jlin has always been an expert at maintaining that delicate balance between man and machine, and \u003ci\u003ePerspective\u003c/i\u003e takes it to another level by using orchestral source material as a blueprint for bodily sub-bass beats. — \u003ci\u003eSandra Song\n\u003c/i\u003e       31. John Francis Flynn, \u003ci\u003eLook Over the Wall, See the Sky\u003c/i\u003e            John Francis Flynn makes tradition sound like innovation. The Irish folk singer’s second album, \u003ci\u003eLook Over the Wall, See the Sky\u003c/i\u003e, taps into an ancient understanding of music and national myth. With his throaty, bran-like voice an echo of his chanting forefathers, and dronescapes like a moaning wind through the lonely countryside, Flynn recreates the law of the Irish land through song, while naturally applying his own modern context and arrangements. Across the album’s eight tracks, Flynn spins 19th-century ballads, early-20th-century American protest songs, and Irish trad ditties into explorations of gray space and sound, refreshing the ancient while seeking out new limits to cross. Fortunately, Flynn’s experimentalism never scans as overly heady. Each song on \u003ci\u003eLook Over the Wall, See the Sky\u003c/i\u003e holds a pre-apocalyptic sense of melancholy that rings with an almost unbearable beauty. It’s a new classic. — \u003ci\u003eEM\u003c/i\u003e\n       30. Maria BC, \u003ci\u003eSpike Field\u003c/i\u003e            The spacious songs of \u003ci\u003eSpike Field\u003c/i\u003e tremble with portent and pain, creating music baptized in a mixture of phantasmagorical blood and the sap of a dead tree. The elemental Oakland artist Maria BC’s talent for rendering the everyday into omens, displayed on their 2022 debut \u003ci\u003eHyaline\u003c/i\u003e, is wielded with surgical precision on this follow-up. Glitchy ambience becomes the new connective tissue for the album’s minimalist network of folk, post-rock, and drone; the fraying electronics serve to underscore the music’s aching gothic mood. There’s a literary quality to the music, even when BC’s voice — a shredded and stained wedding veil — sends their lyrics to a space between texture and narrative. Moments of intense horror, love, and grief appear from the fragments, each small detail containing outsized importance. Taken together, the songs of \u003ci\u003eSpike Field\u003c/i\u003e have an emotional resonance that feels impossible in execution, like lightning across a clear blue sky. — \u003ci\u003eJordan Darville\u003c/i\u003e      [INSERT_AD]                    29. Brevin Kim, \u003ci\u003eHigh School Football\u003c/i\u003e            Before \u003ci\u003eHigh School Football\u003c/i\u003e, Brevin Kim’s music was restless and unpredictable. The first two albums by the Massachusetts-born, Los Angeles-based duo of brothers — 2020’s \u003ci\u003eno less than three\u003c/i\u003e and 2022’s \u003ci\u003ePAIN MUSEUM\u003c/i\u003e — built songs from gnarled 808s and glitchy synths. Their sound veered from distorted emo rap to maximalist trap-pop to vulnerable guitar ballads, each new experiment expressed with despaired sincerity. Their stylistic elasticity and affinity for Auto-Tune earned them shine in the hyperpop ecosystem, but they bristled against classification: their pop ambitions were grander than placement within any single scene or genre. On \u003ci\u003eHigh School Football\u003c/i\u003e, Bren and Cal Paulhus temper their wily sonic appetites and zero in on a cohesive, classic aesthetic: intensely emotional guitar-led music that chews on the anxieties of early adulthood. “WALK ON BY” and “I’ll Be Damned” ruminate on what it means to “be someone” after surviving so much failure, while “ShoulderBlades” and “Architect” grapple with giving too much of yourself to a relationship that’s not giving you much back. To spend time with \u003ci\u003eHigh School Football\u003c/i\u003e is to be energized, moved, crushed, and ruined — sometimes all at once. — \u003ci\u003eBrady Brickner-Wood\u003c/i\u003e       28. ANOHNI, \u003ci\u003eMy Back Was A Bridge For You To Cross\u003c/i\u003e            ANOHNI has perfected the art of hiding sharp objects in soft packaging. For her first full-length album in seven years, she brought back her band, The Johnsons, shifting from the heavy electronic production of her last record, \u003ci\u003eHOPELESSNESS\u003c/i\u003e, to the classic soul sound of her earlier work. She shifted thematically too, replacing the blatant political statements in songs like “Drone Bomb Me” and “4 Degrees'' with tales of ground-level, interpersonal tragedy. Of course, for a fervent, lifelong activist like ANOHNI — and for everyone, in the end — the personal is also political. Embedded in the lover’s plea “It Must Change” (and beyond the not-so-subtle social declaration of its title), there’s a nuanced message about the false binaries that comprise our most fundamental understanding of the world. And “It’s My Fault,” a contemplative mid-album cut, holds a subtle critique of traditionally conceived motherhood. Still, the record occasionally lapses into moments of unchecked beauty, as on “Sliver of Ice,” where ANOHNI recounts a dying Lou Reed experiencing the joy of cold water, as if for the first time. — \u003ci\u003eRH\u003c/i\u003e       27. Mitski, \u003ci\u003eThe Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We\u003c/i\u003e            It’s a minor miracle that Mitski’s latest studio effort, \u003ci\u003eThe Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We\u003c/i\u003e, exists at all. The album arrived after Mitski revealed her intention to take a long creative hiatus following the release of 2022’s \u003ci\u003eLaurel Hell\u003c/i\u003e, and it paints a naked, bare portrait of Mitski: she is making this music, for the simple fact that she just wants to. \u003ci\u003eThe Land Is Hospitable…\u003c/i\u003e is classic Mitski with its intimate lyricism (On “I’m Your Man”: “I'm sorry I'm the one you love / No one will ever love me like you again / So, when you leave me, I should die / I deserve it, don't I?”). But it’s one of Mitski’s most subdued albums, foregoing full-band instrumentation and instead relying on acoustic guitars, vocals, and lyricism. Much has been made of Mitski as a sort of prophet of the sad girl, her songs a hymn for the eternally somber, and on \u003ci\u003eThe Land Is Hospitable…\u003c/i\u003e, she neither tries to accept or deny this title. She writes unapologetically for herself, on both the highs and lows of life as she knows it: “Stride through the house naked / Don't even care that the curtains are open / Let the darkness see me.” — \u003ci\u003eCS\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    26. 100 gecs, \u003ci\u003e10,000 gecs\u003c/i\u003e            The idea of a second album from 100 gecs is, in some sense, ridiculous. Dylan Brady and Laura Les could have opted to shift gears and showcase a more serious side, like their many Discord acolytes who’ve left the hyperpop genre tag behind like a bad smell. Instead, what \u003ci\u003e10,000 gecs\u003c/i\u003e does is present the band with the brightness turned up and Subway Surfers videos flanking them on either side. It’s antagonistic, playful, and designed to alienate as well as illuminate. How else can you explain a song like “Frog On The Floor,” a tinny ska-punk bop about accepting differences in others complete with ribbit sound effects? Or “I Got My Tooth Removed,” which begins as a grunge ballad before those same ska trumpets come back and the skanking resumes? It’s not just Less Than Jake revivalism — \u003ci\u003e10,000 gecs\u003c/i\u003e takes metal riffs, slap bass, and Fred Durst flows and shakes them back to life, removed from their prisons of condescension. Album closer “mememe” may attempt to present gecs as unknowable misfits, but this is the project where they put it all out there. These anti-prestige maestros shun earnestness and lean into audacity. “Can you believe we're doing this?” they ask. “And that it sounds this good?” — \u003ci\u003eDR\u003c/i\u003e\n       25. SZA, \u003ci\u003eSOS\u003c/i\u003e            Much like her fellow Scorpio Joni Mitchell, SZA embodies a vulnerability as transparent as “the cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes.” On \u003ci\u003eSOS\u003c/i\u003e, released at the tail-end of last year but coming to define this one, the horny metaphors and somber reflections on lust she’s wielded deftly since \u003ci\u003eCTRL\u003c/i\u003e are sharpened to the point of drawing blood. Her soaring voice moves between revenge fantasies (billion-streaming fuck-you to exes everywhere “Kill Bill”) and wrenching candor (“Special,” where she bemoans becoming a loser by giving herself to one). She’s also playing with sound, from the rock-driven angst of “F2F” to rapping fools under the table with a vicious, elegant bite on the title track, where she lays out the album’s thesis amid swaggering verses about reclaiming her power: “All the funny shit aside / I just want what's mine.” This inability to keep anything to herself — be it self-hatred or self-empowerment — is what makes SZA’s artistry so painfully relatable. She’s cuttingly self-aware, dishing universal truths that make us blush with secondhand embarrassment or nod in resignation at our own fucked up love lives. Phoebe Bridgers feature “Ghost in the Machine” in particular finds the balance between the cringe and the profound: “Can you touch on me and not call me after?” followed by “I need humanity.” SZA has her knives out, but they’re in the hands of a gentle lover fighting her way back to herself. — \u003ci\u003eERP\u003c/i\u003e\n       24. Evian Christ, \u003ci\u003eRevanchist\u003c/i\u003e            Ten years in the making, Evian Christ’s debut album has the qualities of a party you’ve waited your whole life for and delivers in ways you could never have expected. \u003ci\u003eRevanchist\u003c/i\u003e is a total reinvention for the producer, containing no trace of the menacing, trap-spiked dubstep that Kanye West tapped for 2013’s \u003ci\u003eYeezus\u003c/i\u003e. Now a progressive trance auteur, Evian Christ is interested chiefly in the genre’s expansiveness and its quest for serenity. \u003ci\u003eRevanchist\u003c/i\u003e pushes its boundaries with a varied approach to the yearning. Sometimes that reaches a clamor — on the pulverizing “On Embers,” distant vocals plead, “You got to pray…” amongst the chaos. Immediately after, “Yxguden” pulses like the charges on a controlled demolition, enlisting Bladee to coo of “heavenly visions, ecstasy” and duet with a biblically-accurate rave angel. The rest of \u003ci\u003eRevanchist\u003c/i\u003e is less direct, working with timed fuses and sleights of hand; sections of quietude build to revelatory explosions, or maintain the bliss throughout. For the entire duration of \u003ci\u003eRevanchist\u003c/i\u003e, its music shines with the kind of deep personal enlightenment that can only come from a good deal of time in the shadows, away from the noise. — \u003ci\u003eJD\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    23. DJ K, \u003ci\u003ePanico No Submundo\u003c/i\u003e            Brazilian baile funk is one of the most consistently transgressive styles of music in the world, shattering every conventionally accepted standard of mixing and mastering to create a truly out-of-body sonic experience. São Paulo’s DJ K is the warlock behind a sound he describes as “bruxaria,” or witchcraft, and his debut album is appropriately haunted, a dark transmission from a rave in the deepest circle of hell. \u003ci\u003ePanico No Submundo\u003c/i\u003e is a cacophonous symphony of metallic edges, shrieking cackles, and rapid-fire samples, as DJ K leads us through a sweaty throng of bodies like Orpheus in the underworld. For as massive as the beats can get, with explosive bass that constantly peaks into the red, what’s most remarkable about \u003ci\u003ePanico No Submundo\u003c/i\u003e is the silence: between the heavy drops and the laser blasts are startling moments of quiet, as DJ K strategically utilizes extended pauses to make the peaks seem even higher, while traces of sound linger like long shadows. — \u003ci\u003eNS\u003c/i\u003e\n       22. The Armed, \u003ci\u003ePerfect Saviors\u003c/i\u003e            Detroit punk troupe The Armed (also known as ⋈) have been converting and inspiring new disciples since their early experimental post-hardcore howls, and on \u003ci\u003ePerfect Saviors\u003c/i\u003e, they translate their gospel into language the masses might comprehend. Here, the boundless ambition of 2021’s \u003ci\u003eUltrapop\u003c/i\u003e is focused into a dozen pop songs, some leaning into psychedelia, some into funk grooves, some into unexpected melancholy, all bursting with melody like glow sticks snapped in half. Their devilish pitch to the world — \u003ci\u003ewe’re just like you, come join us, it’s fun here\u003c/i\u003e — is the same one that’s inspired great rock music from the jump. But it’s delivered with such wide-eyed conviction here that when Tony Wolski (\u003ca href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2023/06/27/cover-story-the-armed-perfect-saviors-interview-profile-2023\"\u003eor so we’re led to believe\u003c/a\u003e) spits on “Everything’s Glitter” that “this ain't the same fucking thing you've been sold before,” it’s irresistible. — \u003ci\u003eARR\u003c/i\u003e\n       21. brakence, \u003ci\u003ehypochondriac\u003c/i\u003e            At some point over the last few years, brakence realized it was possible to sound “higher def than real life.” That’s how he described \u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/02/03/1142087568/brakence-hypochondriac-interview\"\u003ehis recent approach to production to NPR\u003c/a\u003e earlier this year, reflecting on the lysergic emoting of his second solo album, \u003ci\u003ehypochondriac\u003c/i\u003e. It’s hard to argue with his assessment, as he laces pristine pop melodies with head-spinning tempo changes, spidery guitar lines, and prickly glitches, like a Merry Prankster dumping research chemicals into Max Martin’s punch bowl. brakence’s subject matter is mundane, almost deliberately so — mixing “self-expression with self-obsession,” he details the burnt-out life of a kid torpedoing his relationships by spending too much time playing guitar, scrolling on Twitter, and wandering the Lands Between in Elden Ring. But \u003ci\u003ehypochondriac\u003c/i\u003e is so dizzy with ideas — there’s room for half-time falsetto codas tagged onto jittery maximalist pop songs, woozy guitars that sound like American Football records playing at the wrong speed, and flirtations with Jersey club — that it lends weight and perspective to these everyday concerns. Chaotic, bored, overwhelming, navel-gazey, it’s like real life — or even realer. — \u003ci\u003eCJ\u003c/i\u003e      [INSERT_AD]                    20. Veeze, \u003ci\u003eGanger\u003c/i\u003e            Beneath the often-monotone, always-nonchalant surface of Veeze’s flow, there’s a sea of intense ambition.

On \u003ci\u003eGanger\u003c/i\u003e — a sprawling debut LP years in the making — the hard work shows. Still, imagining Veeze’s creative decisions as blocks in a calculated façade would be missing the bigger picture. Veeze may not have landed in the studio fully formed, but he’s a true eccentric. He’s paved his path to hip-hop’s highest echelon with a sui generis swagger, full of idiosyncrasies — unfinished ideas containing unexpected pearls of wisdom, tossed-off phrases that hint at his obsessive interest in pop culture, basketball, and conspiracy theories — that would be near-impossible to fake. If rap’s center has shifted to the Midwest, the Detroit native has broken into the operating room and set up camp — slumped in a swivel chair, feet up on the control desk, grin on his face. On \u003ci\u003eGanger\u003c/i\u003e, Veeze switches up flows and beats, pitch shifts, and even sings a little. Watch him in slow motion, though, and you’ll see his eyes are always dead set on the rim. The fancy dribbling might look like showboating, but he never wastes a movement. —\u003ci\u003e RH\u003c/i\u003e\n\n       19. Julie Byrne, \u003ci\u003eThe Greater Wings\u003c/i\u003e            With time, the heaviness of loss lifts. Midway through the titular opener of Julie Byrne’s third album, \u003ci\u003eThe Greater Wings\u003c/i\u003e, the New York singer-songwriter arrives at a thought like this, a moment of clarity intoned with gravel: “Name my grief to let it sing.” It’s exactly what she does across the record, completed in the wake of the death of her close friend and collaborator Eric Littmann. \u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/29/julie-byrne-on-death-of-musical-partner-eric-littmann\"\u003eByrne told \u003ci\u003eThe Guardian\u003c/i\u003e this year\u003c/a\u003e that she “couldn’t outrun [her] grief” after his passing. As a result, \u003ci\u003eThe Greater Wings\u003c/i\u003e is suffused with his presence. She muses on life’s meaning, the weight of eternity, and the other spiraling philosophical questions that the experience shook loose. Meandering but thoughtful, these meditations are accompanied by some of the lushest arrangements of her career, wrapping her delicate fingerpicking in pillowy synth pads, gauzy vocal harmonies, and gentle arpeggiations. The pain and sorrow, as a consequence, are cast in golden-hour light. Even if this mourning takes longer to relent, even if there are always questions, she shares a kind of peace that she’s found in the mourning. — \u003ci\u003eCJ\u003c/i\u003e       18. Reverend Kristin Michael Hayter, \u003ci\u003eSaved!\u003c/i\u003e            Great music should terrify the way an encounter with a ghost or a miracle should. When you hear a sound you can’t identify, a song that seems without providence, music divined by some mystical source rather than the materials of this Earth — that is fucking terrifying. No record this year has instilled more terror in me than Reverend Kristin Michael Hayter’s (f.k.a. Lingua Ignota) \u003ci\u003eSaved!\u003c/i\u003e Composed of music very much of this Earth — gospel standards and originals written in a similarly clerical style — \u003ci\u003eSaved!\u003c/i\u003e shakes tradition and filters the earthly through the hellish divine, with its audio errors, tape manipulation, and spartan keys that ring like the doorbell on the gates of hell. \u003ci\u003eSaved!\u003c/i\u003e sounds like an album that should never have been heard by another living soul, a curiously chilling artifact discovered by some ethnomusicologist who went looking for a benediction but instead found himself cursed. The Reverend reaches out a healing hand to us all the same — but before we can clasp it, we must first walk through the flames. Listening to \u003ci\u003eSaved!\u003c/i\u003e is the aural equivalent of reaching transcendence through self-immolation. Each song is like a blaze, burning with glorious, ecstatic terror; the promise of something beyond ourselves, the taunting of heaven. — \u003ci\u003eEM\u003c/i\u003e\n       17. Caroline Polachek, \u003ci\u003eDesire, I Want To Turn Into You\u003c/i\u003e            What is the ultimate desire? On “Blood and Butter,” a standout moment from her stunning second solo album, Caroline Polachek argues that it is to experience heaven: “Holy water, fire in sky.” \u003ci\u003eDesire, I Want To Turn Into You\u003c/i\u003e sounds like it’s trying to ascend to paradise, filtering the unlikely sounds of Celtic music and flamenco through a pop lens to create something idyllic. Polacheck is aloof (“don’t drop my name”) on “Bunny Is a Rider'' yet found in the depths of a vulnerable moment on “Welcome to My Island.” Grimes and Dido appear on “Fly to You” but are blown away by Polachek, whose ability to climb her vocal register injects enough drama into the sleek drum and bass song to position it between the club and an opera hall. This characterful voice fills in the gaps where Polachek relies on abstract lyricism, with the occasional nod to literature or nature. But a line on “I Believe,” written as a tribute to the late SOPHIE, sticks out. \"I don't know, but I believe / We'll get another day together,” she sings on a piano house beat cut through with razor-sharp synths. It’s a vulnerable admission of what has been left behind and what might await at the end of the ascent. — \u003ci\u003eDR\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    16. Kali Uchis, \u003ci\u003eRed Moon In Venus\u003c/i\u003e            Kali Uchis’s third album is a sparkling study in glamor, longing, and standing tall after heartbreak. Just over a decade since debuting as a recording artist, she’s come to embody a modern-day torch singer. In the same lineage as La Lupe or Sade Adu, Kali Uchis exudes languorous desire and divine femininity. Switching effortlessly between English and Spanish, \u003ci\u003eRed Moon In Venus\u003c/i\u003e showcases the Colombian-American singer’s impressive vocal range, one that spans whistle tones (the karmic indictment “Moral Conscience”) and murmured whispers in a lover’s ear (“Como Te Quiero Yo,” replete with breathy invitations to stop fighting and make love). Collaborations with longtime boyfriend Don Tolliver and kindred spirits Omar Apollo and Summer Walker help the dramatics soar. Thankfully, though, Kali Uchis doesn’t need features (or a man, for that matter) to glisten bright as the full moon. \u003ci\u003eRed Moon In Venus\u003c/i\u003e will go down as a crooning, sighing opus for the real lovers, a lighthouse guiding broken hearts to shore. — \u003ci\u003eERP\u003c/i\u003e       15. Peso Pluma, \u003ci\u003eGÉNESIS\u003c/i\u003e            For years, the accepted industry wisdom has been that Spanish-speaking artists have to pivot to English in order to be embraced by the American mainstream. A new wave of regional Mexican music has upended that inherited logic, as boundary-pushing voices like Peso Pluma reach new audiences while remaining true to their roots. On his breakout album \u003ci\u003eGÉNESIS\u003c/i\u003e, the Jalisco-born vocalist filters the acoustic warmth of traditional Mexican styles like ranchera and norteña through a druggy haze. As much as Peso Pluma embraces his musical heritage, singing over thumping guitarrón and brassy horns, he thumbs his nose at convention just as often. Tales of sordid violence and black market trades aren’t new to Mexican music. But more than an old vaquero howling at the moon, Peso Pluma evokes the depressive numbness of a rapper like Future — on songs like “LADY GAGA,” the material flexes are merely a gilded mask for the emptiness he feels inside. The instrumentation might be old school, but Pluma’s lyricism is distinctly contemporary. — \u003ci\u003eNS\u003c/i\u003e\n       14.

It's meditative, vulnerable, and looks to forgiveness as a means of rebirth. Produced entirely by Inflo, \u003ci\u003eHeaven\u003c/i\u003e pulls from the funk-inspired sounds of Sol’s work with experimental R\u0026B outfit SAULT, murky guitar licks and bouncy percussion adding depth to her affirmations. On songs like “Airplane,” Sol assures herself that life’s obstacles won’t stop her from taking flight, while “Miss Romantic” finds her warning a friend to get rid of a man who mistreats her. As self-assuredly firm as it is lovingly tender, Heaven is like a long hug from that friend who just wants you to do better. — \u003ci\u003eSajae Elder\u003c/i\u003e      [INSERT_AD]                    13. Sexyy Red, \u003ci\u003eHood Hottest Princess\u003c/i\u003e            The first rap song Sexyy Red ever made was a diss track aimed at the “lame-ass bitch” a lover was cheating with; her unfaithful boyfriend liked the song so much he would routinely ask her to rap it for his friends. No surprise, then, that \u003ci\u003eHood Hottest Princess\u003c/i\u003e is a masterclass in shit-talking, covering everything from dingy jewelry to overly friendly bitches and beyond. Was “Pound Town” the song of the summer? Or maybe it was “Hellcats SRTs.” Then again, “SkeeYee” rings off in a crowd. Sexyy’s easygoing confidence and tossed-off lascivity can scan as low-effort titillation to nonbelievers, but being hard of heart is their own loss — standing outside the club will never be as fun as dancing on the table. And Sexyy Red’s appeal goes beyond shock and swagger anyway. Listen carefully and it’s possible to pick out the brash bounce of Trina, the minor-key nihilism of Three 6 Mafia, the wry humor of Tay-K, and the zany unpredictability of 2011 Gucci Mane. It’s said that good artists copy and great artists steal. \u003ci\u003eHood Hottest Princess\u003c/i\u003e suggests that greatness can also be earned through sheer force of will. — \u003ci\u003eVM\u003c/i\u003e       12. Yves Tumor, \u003ci\u003ePraise a Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds)\u003c/i\u003e            “Genre-bending” is a laughably limited way of thinking about Yves Tumor’s work, especially when it comes to \u003ci\u003ePraise A Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds)\u003c/i\u003e. On its own, it’s a rich, dense record that isn’t constrained by a singular sound or concept, but rather a feeling that’s both exhilarating and frightening in its enormity — where Tumor’s melismatic, R\u0026B-infused delivery amps up the glam-rock roots of “Echolalia”; psychedelic guitar riffs push through shoegaze distortion on “Heaven Surrounds Us Like a Hood”; and frenetic screeching melts into belabored gasps and an aughties alt-rock earworm on “God Is a Circle.” Because Tumor is, and always has been, one of the few performers who can take a slurry of grunge-inspired guitar, piledriver synths, and penetrating industrial bass and arrange them into something akin to a spiritual revelation. By the end of \u003ci\u003ePraise…\u003c/i\u003e, Tumor starts to feel like a divine figure themself, shepherding the listener through all the senseless noise and chaos towards deliverance. — \u003ci\u003eSS\u003c/i\u003e\n       11. Fever Ray, \u003ci\u003eRadical Romantics\u003c/i\u003e            Exhaustion and ecstasy coexist on \u003ci\u003eRadical Romantics\u003c/i\u003e, the third album from Fever Ray (a.k.a. Karin Dreijer). The music is an act of self-preservation cast as an avant-garde electronic-pop project; here, the club-centered coming-out odyssey of 2017’s \u003ci\u003ePlunge\u003c/i\u003e is weathered as though from exposure, its bright neon colors curling like paint to reveal the steel that lies beneath. Opener “What They Call Us” announces this direction; the first of four songs co-produced by Olof Dreijer, Karin’s brother and bandmate in The Knife, the song’s synths are warped by paranoia and external pressures. There are these tart techno melodies and jolting grooves, and there are also frostbitten moments like the two Trent Reznor co-productions: the punkish and deliciously deviant revenge fantasy “Even It Out” and brutalist love ballad “North.” Dreijer’s voice remains a minor miracle, careening from the domain of mythic creatures and discovering new wells of energy from this plane’s pleasures and torments. Sex, paranoia, and parental protectiveness rendered homicidal are way stations on the search for lasting connection, with both Karin themself and the outside world. On “Kandy,” they spell out the stakes of their quest: “What if I die alone with this song inside?” — \u003ci\u003eJD\u003c/i\u003e      [INSERT_AD]                    10. HiTech, \u003ci\u003eDÉTWAT\u003c/i\u003e\t            As digital noises have mutated and refined, finding new steps and skips between downbeats, so have the dancefloors they spill onto, sticky with well liquor and grenadine. \u003ci\u003eDÉTWAT\u003c/i\u003e is an ecstatic barrage of heart-pounding 808s and ferocious synths, a demand for movement and sweat, an invective to enter the mosh and shake something. HiTech’s synthesis of ghettotech, hip-hop, juke, and footwork could probably set off a party at any time and place in human history, whether a caveful of Ice Age hominids huddled around a fire or underground raves long after humans terrestrialize Mars. King Milo, Milf Melly, and 47Chops are “\u003ca href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2023/06/23/the-rap-report-hitech-sort-of-break-down-their-new-album-dtwat\"\u003etrying to kill club culture\u003c/a\u003e,” i.e. get people to stop pretending they’re too cool to cut loose. If \u003ci\u003eDÉTWAT\u003c/i\u003e can’t do it, it’s hard to imagine an album that will. The warp speed pitter-patter of “SHRIMP \u0026 GRITS;” the downcast shuffle of “WHYYOUFUGGMYOPPS;” the hollow-point echo of “TAKEOFFINNAPORSCHE;” It’s as if their drums go straight from the ears to the limbs — no need for a conscious thought pitstop at the brain. Or, as they say on “TEETEES DISPO,” “if yo auntie in this bitch she gon get on the floor.” — \u003ci\u003eVM\u003c/i\u003e       9. Sword II, \u003ci\u003eSpirit World Tour\u003c/i\u003e            On \u003ci\u003eSpirit World Tour\u003c/i\u003e, Sword II walks the impossibly thin line between beauty and brutality. These eight tracks sound as if a crate of butterflies were released inside a car factory. Every graceful chord is met with a screech, every perfect harmony paired with ear-ringing percussion. It’s an album of contradictions, of curated chaos. Take track two, “First Rule of the Bug,” on which Maria González’s paper-thin singing voice and José Izaguirre’s muttered Spanish monologues are orated over grating guitars and church bells fit for a baptism. Made up of four stalwarts from Atlanta’s DIY scene — González and Izaguirre plus Travis Arnold, and Certain Z — Sword II has been integral in organizing the fight against Cop City, an 85-acre section of a south Atlanta forest on which the city’s police department is building a training center. At a \u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://nobells.blog/stopcopcity-atlanta-music-festival-police/\"\u003eprotest festival\u003c/a\u003e they performed at in March, hundreds of concertgoers were entrapped by police, 35 were arrested, and 23 were charged with domestic terrorism. \u003ci\u003eSpirit World Tour\u003c/i\u003e is a dark album, reflective of the world around it. If the pounding instrumentation found on tracks like “Mirror” and “Crystal” represent destructive outside forces, then the vocals, subtle and light, speak of somewhere serene and promising. If that place can’t be found in this world, the album poses, then maybe it’s in the next. — \u003ci\u003eMillan Verma\u003c/i\u003e\n       8. Sufjan Stevens, \u003ci\u003eJavelin\u003c/i\u003e            On his 10th album, Sufjan Stevens explores his past lives in his own characteristically intimate way. \u003ci\u003eJavelin\u003c/i\u003e’s collaged cover art hints at its contents: this is Every Sufjan, Everywhere, All At Once. “Goodbye Evergreen” crash-lands with the folk-tronica of \u003ci\u003eThe Age of Adz\u003c/i\u003e. “My Red Little Fox” and “So You Are Tired” brighten the devastating minimalism of \u003ci\u003eCarrie \u0026 Lowell\u003c/i\u003e. “Everything That Rises” begins as a tender plea for deliverance à la \u003ci\u003eSeven Swans\u003c/i\u003e before morphing into something stranger, more akin to Stevens’s work as a neo-modernist composer. And the choirs and bells gilding the whole record make it his most Christmassy album since the actual Christmas album he released in 2006. On the day of \u003ci\u003eJavelin\u003c/i\u003e’s release, Stevens posted a message dedicating the album to his late partner, Evans Richardson — laying bare what had always been the beating heart of his discography. That unburdening reaches its apex on “Shit Talk,” an eight-and-a-half-minute edifice of heartbreak that immediately stands among the best things he’s ever done. After almost three decades, Sufjan Stevens keeps finding new ways to cry. — \u003ci\u003eWG\u003c/i\u003e      [INSERT_AD]                    7. Neggy Gemmy, \u003ci\u003eCBD Reiki Moonbeam\u003c/i\u003e            \u003ci\u003eCBD Reiki Moonbeam\u003c/i\u003e’s thrills are constant, its innovations numerous. Here’s an album that plays like a breakneck joyride around a freaky, feral, and fucking fun version of Los Angeles, where garage and big beat blast from every club and your night ends with Kylie Minogue playing you an unreleased song called “On The Floor,” the hit from \u003ci\u003eFever\u003c/i\u003e that got left off the record. Seemingly designed exclusively for fags and their hags, \u003ci\u003eCBD Reiki Moonbeam\u003c/i\u003e washes some of the narcotic haze from Gemmy’s music, allowing her serpentine voice — sometimes drunken and bratty, other times creaking like an old wooden door — and remarkable talents as a pop producer to properly shine. Like past Neggy Gemmy records, this album is often shot through with melancholy, but it’s more often searching and excitable. The electro-shoegaze of opener “California” gives way to music on constant lookout for a good time, finding it in over-the-top handbag house (“Gemmy Juice”), glazed-over trap (“Twisted”) and screwed up nu-rave (“Seeing Stars”). \u003ci\u003eCBD…\u003c/i\u003e is a testament to the sheer thrills you can conjure with Ableton, heavy eyeliner, and an open mind — so much so that you’d hope the dance-pop divas currently flailing on the charts are taking note. — \u003ci\u003eSD\u003c/i\u003e\n       6. Amaarae, \u003ci\u003eFountain Baby\u003c/i\u003e            Amaarae always has her eyes on the future of Afropop. The Ghanaian-American singer has been steadily working towards that goal since 2017’s \u003ci\u003ePassionfruit Summers\u003c/i\u003e EP announced her arrival during the halcyon days of West Africa’s disruptive alté subculture. Her reputation as a transformative auteur was further established on her debut album, \u003ci\u003eTHE ANGEL YOU DON’T KNOW\u003c/i\u003e, where she bent words and moods at will thanks to her sirenic cadence and shapeshifting production choices that evoked desire and angst in equal measure. On her sophomore album, \u003ci\u003eFountain Baby\u003c/i\u003e, Amaarae continues to operate at a peerless level, reaching deep into herself to make the sort of genre-agnostic music that she has been inching towards for the last half-decade. Simply put, Amaarae no longer plays by conventions, allowing her to create a buoyant, unsinkable record rooted in supreme self-expression about self, community, and love. Here, Amaarae nonchalantly pulls threads from afrobeats, punk, R\u0026B, and alt-pop into a zeitgeist-reshaping sound that’s as luxurious-sounding as it is adventurous. Romance, sex, money, and the supreme art of being a bad bitch guide the narrative of \u003ci\u003eFountain Baby\u003c/i\u003e, but Amaarae is also intimately aware of the trade-offs that life in the fast lane can demand. Look past the heavy subtext and mazy obfuscations of \u003ci\u003eFountain Baby\u003c/i\u003e, and you’ll find evidence of her fluid non-conformity in spades as she waits for the rest of Afropop to catch up. — \u003ci\u003eWO\u003c/i\u003e      [INSERT_AD]                    5. Danny Brown x JPEGMAFIA, \u003ci\u003eSCARING THE HOES\u003c/i\u003e            Defying both an exhausted mainstream rap scene and now-established underground approaches favoring slow tempos and drumless ambiance, \u003ci\u003eScaring The Hoes\u003c/i\u003e is a rap record that isn’t afraid to be fast, loud, and fun. The beats, all by JPEGMAFIA, chop up everything from \u003ci\u003eTRL\u003c/i\u003e staples and Japanese jingles to no wave, noise, and gospel, funneling these disparate sources through a grimy, bitcrushed sampler with no concessions to TikTok trends. This kitchen-sink approach extends to the rhymes, with both Brown and Peggy riling each other up with increasingly outlandish shots at Papa John’s, ‘90s mixtape mainstay Canibus, and people buying Jack Harlow combo meals, among other targets. Here, Brown takes the lead, sounding positively liberated compared to his recent, grim-faced solo work, retooling double-time flows from his EDM-leaning days to narrate sexual exploits and comedowns in equal measure. JPEG, meanwhile, keeps the project grounded, playing the comparative straight man to Brown’s screeching lead while still finding new ways to troll listeners, notably declaring himself “the Black Marjorie Taylor Greene.” An audio smoking session with rap’s preeminent class clowns, \u003ci\u003eScaring The Hoes\u003c/i\u003e is a strong reminder that the best hip-hop is raw, off the cuff, and anything but overwrought. —\u003ci\u003e SR\u003c/i\u003e       4. billy woods \u0026 Kenny Segal, \u003ci\u003eMaps\u003c/i\u003e            billy woods refused to stand still, but the world caught up with him anyway. \u003ci\u003eMaps\u003c/i\u003e might seem on its surface to be the New York independent luminary’s most approachable album yet, after a career marked by hallucinogenically complex rhymes, coiled allusions, and lyrical sleight of hand. Kenny Segal’s beats are mostly looser and lighter than they were on his last full-length with woods, 2019’s nervy \u003ci\u003eHiding Places\u003c/i\u003e, and woods spills diesel-black comedy onto even his darkest visions (try the party scene in “FaceTime” where “the vibe was animal pelts”). Taken as a whole, though, \u003ci\u003eMaps\u003c/i\u003e is disorienting. It’s a reflection of the relentless tour woods went on to make up for two years of lockdown, an album strewn with missed connections and jogged memories, jet lag, dead time in the Low Countries. And what lingers long after the last lonely jazz piano sample isn’t the hellfire vision of “Babylon by Bus” or the out-of-body depression of “Hangman” but the sense of something elemental having been left behind in a rush to catch the next budget flight. So while he raps half in defiance and half in awe near the top of “Soundcheck” that he “might watch the sunset over your city from a parapet or a park bench,” it’s really just another sunset he’s not watching over his own city. By the end, on “NYC Tapwater,” back home with his cat purring on his lap, he’s seeing that the block has changed in his absence. By the final devastating verse on “As The Crow Flies,” when he finally stops still to watch his son in the playground, he’s realized that every moment away is another moment closer to the end. — \u003ci\u003eARR\u003c/i\u003e       3. Lana Del Rey, \u003ci\u003eDid you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd\u003c/i\u003e            \u003ci\u003eDid you know that there’s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd\u003c/i\u003e does away with the idea that Lana Del Rey is a pop musician in any traditional sense, but it arrived during a year in which she was more popular than ever. Del Rey spent 2023 announcing arena tours mere days before they started and selling them out instantly. Her streams skyrocketed. Tens of thousands thronged to her shows across the world, treating her quiet, ramshackle spectacular like the goth girl Super Bowl. Amid all of this was \u003ci\u003eOcean Blvd\u003c/i\u003e, a diffuse but stinging LP that finds her dredging up the threads of her own life and career like hair from a drain. On 2021’s \u003ci\u003eBlue Banisters\u003c/i\u003e, Del Rey sang candidly about her family for the first time, and this record expands on that new facet of her songwriting. On “Fingertips” — a lucent, chorusless ballad — she sings about her relationship with her mother with such fragility that it feels like it could break under the slightest pressure. And “A\u0026W” — the fiery, seven-minute apotheosis of Del Rey’s career to date — details the cruel, reckless misogyny she’s dealt with throughout her life. Befitting an artist totally alone in her field, Del Rey fills \u003ci\u003eOcean Blvd\u003c/i\u003e with allusions to and samples of her own work: the strings from “Norman fucking Rockwell” on “A\u0026W,” the chorus of “Venice Bitch” on “Taco Truck x VB.” It’s heady, sometimes impenetrably so. But in stripping back her work to its barest elements, Del Rey delivers a record that’s clarified and unflinching, and which makes a strident case for her way of doing things: forge your own path and have faith you’ll end up on top. — \u003ci\u003eSD\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    2. Wednesday, \u003ci\u003eRat Saw God\u003c/i\u003e            “We always started by tellin' all our best stories first,” Karly Hartzman begins on Wednesday’s “Chosen to Deserve,” the catchy centerpiece of their best album yet. “So now that it's been a while, I'll get around to tellin' you all my worst.” Hartzman is \u003ci\u003eRat Saw God\u003c/i\u003e’s narrator, recollecting vignettes of the American South with wonder and staunch realism, scored by grunge-inflicted alt-country rock and doses of heavy shoegaze. The record is defined by its vivid, suffocating qualities. There’s the “Hot Rotten Grass Smell” of her neighbor’s freshly-mowed lawn, a sensation evoked by a vigorous onslaught of MJ Lenderman’s doomsaying guitar work. In a confession to a romantic partner on “Chosen To Deserve,” Hartzman details a past full of friends overdosing on Benadryl, “fucking underneath a dogwood tree,” and binge-drinking at her parents’ house. Xandy Chelmis’s distorted pedal-steel only adds to its conflicted nostalgia. Wednesday wrestle with voyeurism on “Bull Believer” — a ripping, eight-minute grunge anthem where the torrential downpour of instrumental chaos, alongside swarming drums and Hartzman’s wailing, make for an exorcism. Across \u003ci\u003eRat Saw God\u003c/i\u003e, they look beyond the grueling realities of their lives in the South and revel in just how pulsating with life it all is, crying for it to not be forgotten. — \u003ci\u003eCS\u003c/i\u003e       1. a.s.o., \u003ci\u003ea.s.o.\u003c/i\u003e            \u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2009/01/01/interview-lee-scratch-perry/\"\u003eLee “Scratch” Perry was moved to create dub music as we know it after throwing on some porn in the studio\u003c/a\u003e. Decades later, dub’s sensuality continues to be heard, a sigh of pleasure echoing across history. That echo was singularly transmuted this year by a.s.o., the Berlin-based duo of Alia Seror-O’Neill and Lewie Day, on their self-titled debut. This is dream-pop for an abandoned megacity airport terminal in a William Gibson story, conspiring for an album that does not seek to mirror what came before to create its power. That’s not to say it runs from the past: there are strands of trip-hop — a genre of greyscale samples, atrophied breakbeats, and ennui rendered rapturous — as well as its more demure sibling downtempo, where dub’s inherent sexiness was integrated into rakish Eurodisco. But it’s in their confluence where something radical happens. The tension between the connections Seror-O’Neill seeks and their absence, and how she lays bare its effect on her, helps the music approach magic. Suddenly, the electronics are iridescent, the mood a deep and endless indigo. Her vocal presence flexes a range spanning from sauna lullaby to horny invocation and thrums with passion displaced by circumstance. People are strange and distant. Lovers can’t be trusted, nor can her own lonely thoughts. The music’s vivid pop orchestration keeps pace, conjuring 24 chrome-slick images every second. \n\nMere appropriation of the Gen X Soft Club aesthetic this album gestures to will be the goal of most ‘90s-mining artists; a.s.o. have a much deeper well of intention. It’s what makes \u003ci\u003ea.s.o\u003c/i\u003e a success rather than imitating styles of music created three or four decades ago, and how the album glides out of their echoes and into one of its own. — \u003ci\u003eJD\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                   \u003ciframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4j6581zSQlD384wqYJ2OcP?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e                   Lana Del Rey Caroline Polachek Danny Brown Kelela SZA Laurel Halo Sufjan Stevens Fever Ray evian christ Jadasea Kali Uchis mitski Jlin The Armed Yves Tumor Anohni Noname Mike Yeule Julia Byrne JPEGMAFIA Samia Mach-Hommy billy woods 100 gecs Kenny Segal amaarae jim legxacy diego raposo brakence gia margaret Tha God Fahim Veeze Maria BC neggy gemmy Asake Jaimie Branch Wednesday bar italia jonatan leandoer96 kara jackson HiTech Nourished By Time Sexyy Redd Peso Pluma Sword II Anysia Kym The Reverend Kristin Michael Hayter DJ K Cleo Sol mark william lewis Brevin Kim aso Hip-Hop R\u0026B Rock Electronic Caribbean Modern Classical Pop Jazz Grime Techno House Drum \u0026 Bass Dancehall Reggae Afrobeats Country Folk Cumbia Reggaeton Ambient Club Footwork Experimental Noise Punk Emo Soul Gospel Jordan Darville Alex Robert Ross David Renshaw Raphael Helfand Cady Siregar Emma Madden Vivian Medithi Nadine Smith Lila Dubois Walden Green Wale Oloworekende Shaad D'Souza Son Raw Sajae Elder Colin Joyce E.R.

      <p>Beats aren't gendered. So why are we still in the dark ages when it comes to gender equality in the music studio? Women represent <a href="http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/women-account-for-less-than-5-percent-of-producers-and-engineers-andmdash-but-maybe-not-for-long/Content?oid=1597594">less than 5%</a> of music producers and engineers, something that <a href="http://www.thefader.com/artist/grimes">Grimes</a> recently highlighted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/522974110633058305">tweet</a> responding to a <em>Guardian</em> piece about the sexual assault and emotional abuse allegations recently leveraged by <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/14/kesha-sues-dr-luke-for-emotional-abuse-and-alleged-sexual-assault">Kesha against Dr, Luke</a>. Unfortunately, it's a story that's disturbingly familiar in relation to the female performer/male producer dynamic. </p><p>Yes, the music industry—like every industry on this patriarchal planet—is sexist. That is not news. But this means we're missing out on a whole world of sounds, stories, and perspectives. If you'll allow me to go a lil' <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1315615-a-room-of-one-s-own">Virginia Woolf</a> for a second, if the vast majority of music that surrounds us is produced by men, then most of the music we document will be music that is produced by men, which is how we got ourselves into this mess in the first place.</p><p>The hunger for change is there, and crucially at a mainstream level: <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/28/kelly-rowland-interview-tokimonsta-collaboration">Kelly Rowland told us</a> she couldn't be more excited to be collaborating with a woman—LA producer Tokimonsta—on her new project, and J Dilla's mom <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/28/interview-ma-dukes">Ma Dukes reminded us</a> that "music is universal; you don't have to speak a certain language to understand what you get from music." So what's up with our current situation? Are women simply less interested than men in being producers, or is society not providing the support? The FADER spoke with 13 producers, who also happen to be women, about the challenges faced by women in production and engineering, and what they think can be done to make things better.</p><p><br></p>

	Unfortunately, the repulsive reality is women are expected to be the sexualized commercial object for sale in music, and production and engineering is rarely objectified for financial gain. [Barriers to career progression for women include] misogyny, sexism, unequal pay, alienation, pressure to sell your body for coins, pressure to make your body (rather than your music) the central focus of your career in order to survive in the industry, segregation (for example: all-female line-ups).

	There are plenty of female artists out there now who are self-produced and doing cutting-edge productions to surround their own vocals or compositions, which is vital part of the musical landscape right now, but the resulting message is that the female producer is an aesthetically presented vocalist who only produces her own songs. This sets up three additional hurdles to an already challenging field, because vocal chops, aesthetic presentation, and songwriting are three separate and time-consuming skills that should in no way be prerequisite. The archetype of Male Producer (take Rick Rubin, or Phil Spector for example) is not a man who necessarily composes, sings, or looks good on camera. Quite the opposite—the Male Producer is passionate about music but not a performer, putting in years hunched behind the console in unglamorous isolation before achieving guru status. By holding up female performers as producer-icons, we could potentially be discouraging the girls who don't feel comfortable presenting themselves as visual objects from entering the field. At the moment, an artist is not as likely to bring in a woman to produce his track as a man, not because of a bias against women per se, but because on some level it's playing safe: a killer producer, history tells us, looks like a man. Also the steep minority of women producers to choose from makes it a less likely match for artists seeking it out. But Jay-Z brought in 16 year old Ebony "WondaGurl" Oshunrinde to make beats for his <em>Magna Carta</em> record, and hopefully more rappers will follow suit.</p><p>
	<strong>How to change things:</strong> For others aspiring to be the next WondaGurl, there's an uphill battle to push through to be taken seriously by clients and create a whole new archetype for girls on deck, and the ones who do will be heroes and exponentially attract others to the field. I think it's up to girls to teach themselves the skills they need and step up to the plate as musical pioneers, not up to corporate sponsorships to give handouts that emphasize that the recipient is a minority rather than as a expert. Ultimately the music has to speak for itself and make the biggest change. I really think it's only a matter of time though. I'd give it five years max till we have a top 10 track made by a female producer.

	I believe there aren't many female producer and engineers, because they find this side of the business to be mostly male-dominated and many woman do not like to have to compete with men. If you have the art of sound, and feel you can put the music together to make yourself feel good, there should be no barrier to progress in this industry. You just have to have the right team around, the music speaks for itself. I'm not sure why a woman has never won a Grammy [in this field], but I feel Missy Elliot should get a Grammy for her hard work in the industry as a producer. I would also like to win a Grammy one day, that would be so cool.<br>
</p><p>
	<strong>How to change things: </strong>I feel women should enter more beat battle competitions, that would be the first step in getting noticed by people from all over. There are many industry people that attend those events and that I feel would be a good place to promote yourself.

	<a href="http://www.hollyherndon.com/"></a>Music, despite common misconceptions, is quite conservative. The archetypes don't seem to ever really change. It's quite transparent how little the music industry formula, or major motion picture formula, has changed since the advent of the internet. It's like they are in permanent austerity mode, and so play it safe. Every year we get a diva, a dancer, a bad boy, a crooner, a girl next door, a fashion queen, a dainty songstress; all younger updates on a previous model. No room for new archetypes. The most powerful thing about hip-hop is that it has a history of setting it's own agenda and taking risks, but sadly is often also burdened with crippling gender issues. Our biggest barrier is our infatuation with these old archetypes, and a lack of insistence on establishing new ones that reflect a culture we would like to live in. That extends far beyond gender issues. We have to create new fantasies.
</p><p>
	<strong>How to change things</strong>: I think this is something more complex than just female involvement. I think a number of people struggle to find a place within the industry due to this preoccupation with old archetypes, and insistence that people adhere to the same affected role-playing in order to be considered worthy of opportunities. Adherence to those kind of roles inherently creates barriers for people of diverse lifestyles and opinions.  What distinguishes someone like Missy Elliott, for example, is that she exists outside of those narrow roles, and ultimately I think that until people insist on seeing greater diversity of style and opinion in popular music we will continue to face this challenge.

	I think a lot of girls get intimidated by such a male-driven profession. The set up for ages has been female performers and male producers, and I think people simply get used to this arrangement. A big barrier is the stigma. Like "You're good, for a girl." Having to explain yourself, simply because people aren't used to the idea of a woman being in charge.

	I think our culture has systematically engrained this idea that technology is more of a man's thing. Men were ones that fixed the VCR, women were the ones that watched the VHS of <em>Titanic</em> on the VCR. Men have to be open minded to the fact that women can make platinum selling beats in every category of music. Though women are starting to take over more music exec positions, there are still the big guys up there that may continue to undermine our ability to make quality tracks.
</p><p><strong>How to change things:</strong> It would be too easy to name things like "start school programs" or air PSAs. The reality is that there is a systematic flaw in our culture. Women need to feel proud to stand on their own and be creative without worrying about how we may be inadequate.

	Engineering and producing is a scary thing to start and a very difficult thing to stick with and excel at. Making it to the top is very competitive. A lot has already been said about the idea that women are generally less likely to initially try something for fear of judgment or failure than men and to combat this I really believe the key to change is more visible female producers. The more there are in the public space, the more young girls will see it as a option for them from a young age and find the confidence to start learning. That means we need women not only to be producing but—and this is important—to stimulate meaningful change we need them to actually rise to the top and become visible. Producers by nature aren't always visible, so that means to create most change, she must not only be a producer but also potentially have what it takes to be a performer—publicly seen and embraced. We all are aware of the standards expected of women in this area so I'll just leave that there. We need some pretty one in a million girls to help break the cycle so it truly is a numbers game: the more women going into the industry means the more women going up, and visibility is the key to change.
</p><p>
	<strong>How to change things:</strong> It's a two prong attack: 1) Getting more girls exposed to introductory production workshops at a young age before they get into that teenage headspace of learning that they can't. 2) Developing some quality production mentoring programs that are specifically aimed at promising young female engineers to develop their skills further. This mentoring program is something I have thought a lot about initiating when I get the time and support.<br>

	I think there are a million reasons and it's way deeper than the "boys club" theory. I think a lot of professions are like this. Less doctors, less lawyers, less filmmakers, less directors whatever. I think it stems from society telling girls they should be wearing pink and playing with Barbies and cooking in an Easy Bake Oven. Even if they aren't specifically told these things everything leans towards it, which puts in people's heads that they aren't supposed to do such things, or it would never work or be accepted. I think it starts there. I also think that not a lot of females are mentored by the right people. I have worked with several men that started to feel threatened the second I started to get a little bit of attention. Most men get freaked out when women do things better than them or even as good as them and it goes for everything. Politics, music, business, whatever.<br>
</p><p>
	<strong>How to change things: </strong>Production and engineering schools should encourage women to join, maybe look at their ratio, start mentoring programs. The few women in high positions should take other women under their wing and help them. That goes for male engineers too. This all goes down to the basic bottom line of feminism in general though.<br>

	Honestly I don't know why there aren't more female producers and engineers. Maybe because the industry doesn't highlight the few females that are in that profession, unlike the many males that get plenty of attention. Or maybe because some females just aren't interested. It takes more than creativity and a good ear, to be a producer and/or engineer takes time. So there's this thing called passion that you must possess.
</p><p>
	<strong>How to change things:</strong><em> </em>I think the industry should highlight the many female producers and engineers we do have in the music industry, no matter what scene they may be in, and maybe that will encourage more girls to take on the challenge. There's numerous females that work magic outside of the vocal booth—Sylvia Robinson who produced the hip-hop classic "Rapper's Delight" to Beyonce who was a producer on her <em>I Am.. Sasha Fierce</em> album—but that gets no praise when it should.<br>

	There have been a fair few [female producers and  engineers] actually. From Delia Derbyshire to Tina Weymouth to Susan Day to Missy to Zavoloka. Game changing birds that all the boys know about and listen to, but whose impact was/is always somehow defused by their positioning within the cultural context. Women must also take responsibility for playing the role of titty, cutie, breeder and feeder. The world isn't fair and it is a harder stance to take on than to just acquiesce, and most humans will go for the road most travelled. Humans crave validation and we all have to take responsibility for how we manifest that. The newer breed are much more computer savvy and ready to have a go on the technology (less girls who just want to have a sing).</p><p>
	<strong>How to change things:</strong> Stop making cheap glamour, fame and attention so desirable—but this is a crisis within society as a whole and not just this business called show. Art has children and instead of revering people like Missy, the press champions nonsense like Madonna as a modern woman—and if u look at what she has "bred," it's verging on cultural crimes against humanity. I understand that she has made money etc, but if that is the criteria then Starbucks really is God. Offer ALL your kids chemistry sets and coding lessons. There is hope because everyone has computers and it's up to the parents and the girls themselves to put in the hours to learn these things. Raise humans with the confidence and the tools to do this and we may yet advance. Recognize Missy.

	The road to the top is hard everywhere: music, science, academia etc. It takes a lot of work, courage and perseverance. By the time we reach true expertise in a certain field, we are usually confronted with the choice between career or motherhood and, although both are possible, I just can't imagine being able to exceed in both. I'm 31 and I don't have children (yet) because I chose to work on my music career. Tracy Emin said in an interview recently "There are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men." Perhaps this is why a lot of women 'give up.' Some are scared to enter the male-dominated industry but that shouldn't be an excuse anymore. If you don't stand up for your work you won't get anywhere. This industry is hard and nasty a lot of the times, you just have to keep your chin up and create strong work that can't be ignored.</p><p>
	<strong>How to change things: </strong>Start young! Encourage music programming in schools or kindergardens, show how easy and fun it actually is, let them fall in love with it and pursue it as a career. Provide workshops and learning events where girls (and boys) can learn and practice for free. Encourage mentoring by other women artists. Bigger female representation in music events and in music press, without drawing undesired attention to it (less click-bait articles about the problem, more focus on the work of women producers). And if you're going to write about it, include men in the debate, we need to shift this paradigm together and work towards equality in the future.

	In any field that's so heavily dominated by powerful men, it's extremely difficult for women to gain respect or be welcomed, and in the music industry the sheer intimidation of how women are treated probably keeps many aspiring female producers from moving up the ladder and garnering proper attention. Whereas only 5% of high profile producers and engineers are female, there are obviously many other women still under the radar. They're out there, just not included in that noteworthy percentage, which to me is the biggest problem.<br>
</p><p>
	<strong>How to change things: </strong>Since power starts at the top, it would be great if both labels and high profile artists took a little more time and consideration when selecting producers, and reached out to talented women instead of cycling through the same ~10 men that are responsible for most of what you hear on the radio (also a good look for the general diversification and progression of pop music). But since that takes more time and effort and equality doesn't seem to be much of a concern to the industry higher-ups, we need to keep having this conversation and having it loud. If pop music's audience is vocal about a change needing to happen, maybe we can shake the structure from the bottom. Profiling talented female producers and engineers more frequently is a start. Profiling women in the music industry without the qualifier of "female" would be great, since female isn't a genre.

<h2>The Company of Biologists is a signatory to United2Act Against Paper Mills</h2>
<p><img src="https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/ImageLibrary/JournalsGateway/United2Act_logo.png?versionId=6776" alt="United2Act logo" style="width: 150px; height: 52px;" /></p>
<p>Publishers big and small play an important part in protecting research integrity. Like many other publishers, we put <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/pages/journal-policies">systems, tools and processes</a> in place to help us with this, and we are members of a number of organisations dedicated to maintaining standards in publishing ethics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some players in the scholarly publishing landscape that are not genuine and the problem of so-called paper mills is a threat to authors and publishers alike. According to COPE “[p]aper mills are the process by which manufactured manuscripts are submitted to a journal for a fee on behalf of researchers with the purpose of providing an easy publication for them, or to offer authorship for sale.” Some of these organisations seem genuine on the surface and it can be hard for researchers to spot the bad actors.</p>
<p>It is important that the various stakeholders work together to address the problem of paper mills, which is why we have become signatories of United2Act Against Paper Mills, an initiative supported by COPE and STM. A summit in May 2023 led to several collective actions that all signatories support, and working groups have been set up to develop these plans further. </p>

<h2>JEB launches two new grants for junior faculty staff</h2>
<p>To celebrate its <a href="/jeb/pages/100">100th anniversary</a>, Journal of Experimental Biology has launched two new grants to support junior faculty staff. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.biologists.com/grants/kickstart-travel-grants/" target="_blank">Research Partnership Kickstart Travel Grants</a> aim to support junior faculty staff (e.g. Lecturer, Assistant Professor, Group Leader, Principal Investigator) to travel to another research lab for up to seven days to initiate a new research collaboration and develop, write and submit a major grant application for collaborative research.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biologists.com/grants/ecr-visiting-fellowships/" target="_blank">ECR Visiting Fellowships</a> provide funding to junior faculty staff (e.g. Lecturer, Assistant Professor, Group Leader, Principal Investigator) to attract an early-career researcher (e.g. graduate student or post-doctoral researcher) to undertake a defined research project in their lab for one to three months.</p>
<p>To be eligible for either of these two grants, applicants must be within five years of setting up their first lab/research group and be working in the field of experimental biology relating to animal comparative physiology or biomechanics.</p>

<h2>The Forest of Biologists — a bio-positive publishing initiative from The Company of Biologists</h2>
<p><img src="https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/ImageLibrary/Forest/fob-strap-black.svg?versionId=6776" alt="The Forest of Biologists logo" style="width: 200px; height: 79px;" /></p>
<p>The Company of Biologists is excited to announce a new biodiversity initiative — <a href="https://forest.biologists.com" target="_blank">The Forest of Biologists</a> — creating, restoring and preserving important woodland habitats in the UK.</p>
<p>For each Research Article and Review article published in the five Company journals (<a href="https://journals.biologists.com/dev">Development</a>, <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jcs">Journal of Cell Science</a>, <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb">Journal of Experimental Biology</a>, <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/dmm">Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms</a>, <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/bio">Biology Open</a>), a tree is planted in a UK forest. For each peer review completed, a piece of ancient woodland is being preserved. All of these trees are represented together in a virtual forest.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://forest.biologists.com" target="_blank">forest.biologists.com</a> to see the trees that have been planted and preserved to date and read the <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/150/6/dev201715/297131">Editorial</a>&nbsp;to find out more about the launch of this initiative.</p>

<h2>Journal of Experimental Biology uses Proofig to aid image manipulation checks</h2>
<img src="https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/ImageLibrary/BiologyOpen/Proofig_logo_small.PNG?versionId=6776" alt="Proofig logo" style="width: 150px; height: 45px;" /><br />
<p>The Company of Biologists has chosen <a href="https://www.proofig.com/" target="_blank">Proofig</a> to help with image manipulation checks across its portfolio of journals in the biological and biomedical sciences field.</p>
<p>All articles accepted by Journal of Experimental Biology and its sister journals undergo rigorous ethics checks, including screening for plagiarism and image manipulation. We use a combination of tools and technology alongside a team of people for best practices in our ethics checks procedures. Proofig will aid our team to analyse a wide variety of images, including western blot bands, all types of microscopies (confocal, light or electron), plates, plants, <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> images.</p>
<p>Find out more about image manipulation on our <a href="/jeb/pages/journal-policies#images">journal policy page</a>.</p>

<h2>Journal of Experimental Biology has exceeded its Open Access target for 2021</h2>
<p>In August 2020 Journal of Experimental Biology, along with its sister journals Development and Journal of Cell Science, committed to becoming a Transformative Journal.</p>
<p>Transformative Journals proactively champion Open Access publishing and have Open Access growth targets. Over the 2021-2024 transition period, the journals aim to grow the proportion of Open Access research content by at least 5% year-on-year in absolute terms. For 2021, these targets were not only met, but they were exceeded, with Journal of Experimental Biology’s Open Access research content growing by around 15%.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/ImageLibrary/JExperimentalBiol/News/TJ%20progress%202021.PNG?versionId=6776" style="width: 600px; height: 379px;" /></p>
<p>Read &amp; Publish agreements played an important part in reaching these targets – these are agreements made with our library partners to offer authors an additional APC-free Open Access publishing route.</p>
<p>Read more about our status as a <a href="https://bit.ly/3pV8n2U" target="_blank">Transformative Journal</a>, which allows us to support a range of publishing options for our authors, and check our&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/3sXKcDc" target="_blank">list of participating institutions</a> to see if you are eligible for APC-free publication of OA Research Articles through our Read &amp; Publish initiative.</p>

<h2><a id="name_change" name="name_change"></a>Journal of Experimental Biology facilitates author name changes retrospectively</h2>
<p>The Company of Biologists recognises that there are many reasons why an author might want to change their name, including but not limited to marriage, divorce, change in gender identity or change in religion. Having your name changed on academic papers retrospectively means that you are still correctly linked to those papers and your contribution to science is traceable. To support this process, The Company of Biologists, the publisher of JEB, facilitates retrospective name changes on all its journals. Authors can choose to have name changes made with or without a public notification in the journal and it will not require a formal correction of the article in question. </p>

<h2><a id="covid-update" name="covid-update"></a>How JEB is supporting our community through the COVID-19 pandemic: update</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 outbreak, declared as a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, has had an unprecedented impact on researchers worldwide. With many labs, institutes and universities now reopening, the Editors of The Company of Biologists’ journals have reviewed the actions announced in <a href="#COVID-19">March</a> aimed at alleviating concerns that members of our community may have had at that time.</p>
<p>We are sure that everyone will recognise the need for ongoing flexibility as the impact of the evolving pandemic continues to be felt at both home and work.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any reviewer or author unable to meet deadlines set by the journal should contact the <a href="mailto:jeb@biologists.com">Editorial Office</a> for advice on deadline extension.</li>
    <li>Many authors are likely to still be experiencing disruption to the normal running of their lab that makes experimental revisions challenging. The journal needs to ensure that submissions are held to the same standards as usual and that all conclusions drawn in a paper are supported by the data presented. However, we remind reviewers to limit requests for experimental revisions to those they deem essential for publication in the journal.</li>
    <li>Where authors are concerned about their ability to respond to reviewers’ reports, we encourage them to contact the <a href="mailto:jeb@biologists.com">Editorial Office</a> to discuss their revision further.</li>
    <li>Our <a href="journal-policies#Scoop">scoop protection</a> policy means you don’t need to worry about being scooped once you’ve submitted your manuscript – even if your revisions take longer than expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope these policies will continue to support our communities. Please contact the <a href="mailto:jeb@biologists.com">Editorial Office</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>In recognition of the unprecedented and ongoing challenges facing the library and research communities worldwide, there will be no increase in The Company of Biologists’ e-journal prices in 2021.</p>
<p>As a not-for-profit publisher committed to maximising the availability of high-quality biological science research, we are keen to support our authors, readers and library customers as far as possible during these difficult times.</p>
<p>We are therefore freezing fees for e-access to our subscription journals – Development, Journal of Cell Science and Journal of Experimental Biology – until 31 December 2021. This applies to both new and existing customers. Article processing charges (APCs) for these three journals will also remain at 2020 levels throughout 2021.</p>
<p>In addition, we are waiving 2021 price increases for the two-year Read &amp; Publish Open Access agreements we have signed with national library consortia – Jisc in the UK, IReL in Ireland, and MALMAD in Israel – and with individual institutions.</p>

<h2><a id="COVID-19" name="COVID-19"></a>How JEB is supporting our community through the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>
<p>We are, of course, aware that the COVID-19 pandemic is having an unprecedented impact on researchers worldwide, with many labs shutting down either partially or fully. The Editors of all The Company of Biologists’ journals have been considering ways in which we can alleviate concerns that members of our community may have around publishing activities during this time. Here, we detail the actions we are taking at this point:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any reviewer or author unable to meet deadlines set by the journal should contact the <a href="mailto:jeb@biologists.com">Editorial Office</a> and we will be able to extend your deadline. Our Academic Editors may also be somewhat delayed in handling papers as they deal with pressing matters – we hope that all parties will recognise the need for increased flexibility with timelines during this period. Please note that reviewers will still receive automated reminders from our system, but these are not intended to put you under increased pressure so please just let us know if you need extra time.</li>
    <li>Our <a href="journal-policies#Scoop">scoop protection policy</a> means you don’t need to worry about being scooped once you’ve submitted your manuscript – even if your revisions take longer than expected. Moreover, we will not necessarily reject a new submission if a competing paper has just been published: in these cases, we encourage authors to contact us to discuss how to proceed.</li>
    <li>We ask that reviewers bear in mind that authors may be unable to conduct experimental revisions for a paper. Obviously, the journal needs to ensure that submissions are held to the same standards as usual, and that all conclusions drawn in a paper are supported by the data presented, but we ask reviewers to limit requests for experimental revisions to those they deem essential for publication in the journal.</li>
    <li>Where authors are concerned about their ability to respond to reviewers’ reports, we encourage them to contact the <a href="mailto:jeb@biologists.com">Editorial Office</a> to discuss their revision further. Please send us a point-by-point response indicating where you are able to address concerns raised (either experimentally or by changes to the text) and where you will not be able to do so within the normal timeframe of a revision. The Editor will then provide further guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope these policies will help to support authors during these difficult times; we will continue to review the situation going forwards. Please don’t hesitate to contact the <a href="mailto:jeb@biologists.com">Editorial Office</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Following Hans Hoppeler’s announcement of his intention to step down as Editor-in-Chief of Journal Experimental Biology in July 2020, The Company of Biologists initiated a community consultation to search for a new Editor-in-Chief with a strong vision both for the future evolution of the journal and for its role in the community. Following a shortlisting and interview process, we are pleased to announce that Craig Franklin (University of Queensland, Australia) will be the next Editor-in-Chief of JEB.</p>
<p>With research interests in animal ecophysiology and conservation physiology, and a JEB Monitoring Editor since 2011, Craig is already very familiar with the journal and says he is looking forward to his new role: “I am excited by the opportunity to work with a great team of editors and editorial staff to ensure the continuing success of JEB. It would be remiss not to acknowledge the outstanding leadership and direction provided by Hans over the past 16 years. The sense of community among the authors, reviewers and editorial staff is one of the strengths of JEB, and I look forward to working on your behalf.”</p>
<p>Over the next few months, Craig will be working alongside Hans to ensure a smooth handover when Hans steps down at the end of July.</p>
<p>The Company of Biologists would like to thank all members of the JEB community - Editorial Board members, early-career researchers, reviewers, authors and readers – who took part in the consultation and provided feedback, not only on who they would like to see at the helm but also on the journal’s strengths and weaknesses and the challenges that both JEB and the comparative physiology/biomechanics community face in the coming years. We will be sharing some of this feedback in an Editorial later in the year.</p>

Publons makes it simple for reviewers to showcase their peer review contributions in a format that can be included in job and funding applications (without breaking reviewer anonymity). Reviews completed previously can also be added by forwarding review receipts (i.e. ‘Review received’ emails) to <a href="mailto:reviews@publons.com">reviews@publons.com</a>.</p>

As The Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC) puts it: ‘Citations are the most important vehicle for the discovery, dissemination, and evaluation of all scholarly knowledge.’</p>
<p>This is why we choose to support this important initiative I4OC and ensure that the citation data in all of our journals is freely accessible. It means that everyone can access the citation data for all articles, even if they cannot access the scientific article itself. This is done by depositing reference lists with Crossref and ensuring the citation data is open, both for future articles, and also for all articles in our online archives.</p>
<p>For more information on this initiative and the publishers who support it, visit <a href="https://i4oc.org/">https://i4oc.org/</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="formatfree" name="formatfree"></a>Journal of Experimental Biology introduces format-free submission</h2>
<p>At Journal of Experimental Biology, we are committed to making submission as easy as possible for our authors. We realise that submitting a paper to any journal can be a lengthy process: authors are asked to comply with detailed journal-specific guidelines without knowing whether the paper will be accepted or even peer-reviewed. We are therefore delighted to announce our new format-free submission policy.</p>
<p>Authors can now submit a paper to Journal of Experimental Biology in any format. We will only ask what is absolutely necessary at submission. What this means is that as long as an article adheres to our guidelines on length and the text and figures are easily viewable by reviewers, we only require information that is necessary to confirm the identities of all authors. This does mean that other requirements, such as file formats and sizes, our submission checklist, and provision of funding information, will move to the revision stage – at which point over 95% of papers will be accepted for publication.</p>
<p>As part of this change, and recognising the importance of comprehensive Materials and Methods sections to aid transparency and reproducibility, we are also removing the Materials and Methods section from our length limit to an article. The aim is to allow authors the space they need to describe their methods in sufficient detail for readers to fully understand and replicate the experiments conducted.</p>
<p>For further details, please refer to our <a href="manuscript-prep">Manuscript Preparation guidelines</a>, or <a href="mailto:jeb@biologists.com?subject=Format-free%20submission">get in touch</a> with any queries.</p>

<h2><a id="biorxiv" name="biorxiv"></a>Journal of Experimental Biology supports preprints – two-way integration with bioRxiv</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/ImageLibrary/JournalsGateway/cshl_logo.png?versionId=6776" style="width: 169px; height: 80px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/ImageLibrary/JournalsGateway/bioRxiv_logo.png?versionId=6776" style="width: 174px; height: 60px;" /></p>
<p>The Company of Biologists and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s preprint server <a href="https://biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> are delighted to announce two-way integration of their manuscript submission systems, operated by Bench&gt;Press (HighWire Press).</p>
<p>Authors depositing a manuscript in bioRxiv can now transfer their paper directly to any of The Company of Biologists’ journals (Development, Journal of Cell Science, Journal of Experimental Biology, Disease Models &amp;Mechanisms and Biology Open) through a simple transfer portal – avoiding the need to re-enter information or upload files in multiple submission systems.</p>
<p>In addition, authors submitting a manuscript to any of The Company of Biologists’ journals can deposit their article in bioRxiv through a simple one-click process in the journal's submission system. Once deposited through this optional service, the unrefereed manuscript will become free for anyone to read almost immediately, regardless of the editorial decision made at the journal. It will be citable with a bioRxiv DOI, and its usage can be tracked. This system has been in place at Development for several months. Feedback has been positive and the service is now being extended to all the Company’s journals.</p>
<p>Through these services, The Company of Biologists aims to support authors in making their research available to the community at an early stage – before peer review and formal publication.</p>

<h2><a id="orcid" name="orcid"></a>ORCID iD required for corresponding authors</h2>
<h2><img alt="" src="https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/ImageLibrary/JournalsGateway/ORCID.png?versionId=6776" style="width: 174px; height: 78px;" /></h2>
<p>We have recently signed the <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID </a>agreement, joining the growing number of publishers who recognize the value of widespread ORCID adoption and require ORCID iDs to be provided at submission by their authors.</p>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID </a>provides a unique identifier for all researchers that can be linked to their different research works and activities across multiple platforms. It also serves to distinguish authors with similar names and simplify searching of publications databases (such as PubMed, Scopus, etc.) to avoid retrieving articles by authors with the same name.</p>
<p>During the submission process, the corresponding author will be required to provide an ORCID iD and we encourage authors to use ORCID iDs to identify each researcher.</p>

<h2><a id="dryad" name="dryad"></a>Data accessibility made easy with Dryad</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/ImageLibrary/JournalsGateway/Dryad.png?versionId=6776" style="width: 165px; height: 98px;" /></p>
<p>We are delighted to announce that The Company of Biologists journals, including Journal of Experimental Biology, are partnering with the <a href="https://datadryad.org/" target="_blank">Dryad </a>data repository to support authors in making the data underlying their research available to the community, and to better integrate data accessibility with manuscript submission.</p>
<p>For many years, Journal of Experimental Biology has encouraged authors to make data that cannot be included as ‘flat’ figures available to readers upon publication. Several appropriate field-specific repositories exist where authors can deposit data for community access. <a href="journal-policies#data" target="_blank"> Journal of Experimental Biology journal policies</a> require  that such data are made available at the time of publication, and encourages authors to deposit at an early stage so that referees can review the data behind the paper.</p>
<p>However, issues of data availability apply across all fields and data types and, in many cases, there is no specific repository for the deposition of data. In some cases, relevant data can be made available as part of the Supplementary Information, but this is not always appropriate (particularly given the large file sizes that are often involved). To overcome this problem, a number of general purpose data repositories have been developed that allow researchers to submit data packages in almost any format, and can be accessed and cited by the community. In addition, they allow your files to be permanently and safely archived. Where appropriate, Journal of Experimental Biology encourages authors to submit data to repositories such as <a href="https://datadryad.org/" target="_blank">Dryad</a> and <a href="https://figshare.com/" target="_blank">figshare</a>.</p>
<p>Our partnership with <a href="https://datadryad.org/" target="_blank">Dryad</a> will now allow authors to submit their data packages at the time of manuscript submission, so that the data can be made securely available to referees and then automatically made public, if and when the paper is published. Dryad charges a small <a href="https://datadryad.org/pages/payment" target="_blank">fee</a>, but <a href="https://datadryad.org/pages/payment" target="_blank">waivers </a>are available for submissions from low-income or lower-middle-income economies. Data packages are given a permanent, citable DOI and bidirectional linking between the data and the paper will help readers easily access the relevant files. We are not changing our <a href="/pages/journal-policies#data" target="_blank">policies</a> regarding deposition, but hope to make it easier for authors to deposit data where they wish to do so. Our staff and editors can provide advice to authors on what types of data should ideally be made available, so please feel free to <a href="mailto:jeb@biologists.com">get in touch</a> with any queries. See <a href="https://datadryad.org/pages/faq" target="_blank">Dryad's FAQs</a> for more information. We welcome your feedback on this new partnership.</p>

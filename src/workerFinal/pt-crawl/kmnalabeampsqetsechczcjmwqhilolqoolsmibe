    <td><p align="center">McWORLD: DIVIDE OR IMPERA? BOTH ! </p>
    <p>The July 13, 1992 International Herald Tribune [IHT] features two articles on
    centripetal and centrifugal opposing forces in the contemporary world. A front page
    article by the New York Times' Thomas Friedman cites Harvard's Robert Reich among others
    on simultaneous centripetal globalization and nationalist or ethnic centrifugal
    self-assertion. In East Asia the future seems to be burying the past, Friedman writes,
    while in Sarajevo, the West Bank, Nagorno-Karabak, Moldova and Northern Ireland the past
    seems to be burying the future. The editorial page features the Washington Post's E.J.
    Dionne on the contradiction between the decline of national economies through
    globalization and &quot;the decline of big ideas&quot; as well as &quot;the impulse to
    fragment&quot; into nationalism and xenophobia. These contradictory observations are
    becoming ever more common and were also reflected in a long article in the March 1992
    [Vol. 269, No. 3] Atlantic by Benjamin Barber entitled &quot;Jihad Vs. McWorld.&quot; All
    these observations are very much to the point in the turbulence among today's global
    villages. </p>
    <p>However, most of the analyses of these observations, and particularly Barber's article,
    miss the essential point: The centripetal &quot;McWorld&quot; globalism and the
    centrifugal &quot;Jihad&quot; tribalism are not two distinct and opposed tendencies. The
    furure and the past, as well as East and West Asia, Eastern Europe and Northen Ireland are
    all inexterably connected if not united in the present McWorld economic and therefore
    political crisis. The centrifugal national, ethnic, religious and other outbursts are the
    direct result of globalizing centripetal pressures and the resultant simultaneous crisis
    in this process. The centrifugal manifestations are -- in the words of Robert Reich -- the
    &quot;counter-reaction&quot; to the painful centripetal exigencies. </p>
    <p>Jihad is the response to the fact that, as Mr. Barber points out, &quot;all national
    economies are now vulnerable to the inroads of larger, transnational markets.&quot; For
    the market, resource, ecological and information-technological imperatives of
    globalization themselves generate the fragmentation and Lebanonization of the world. The
    reason is that, although &quot;each of the four imperatives just cited is transnational,
    transideological, and transcultural,&quot; they do not apply &quot;impartially&quot; and
    McWorld does not &quot;deliver peace, prosperity and relative unity.&quot; On the
    contrary, globalization itself generates economic polarization into haves and have-nots,
    both on a global scale and within particular societies. Thereby, globalization also
    threatens the cultural identity of both. Moreover, during recurrent world economic crises
    like the present one, the have nots are economically immiserated by absolute as well as
    relative loss of income. As the Bible correctly observed, &quot;to those that hath shall
    be given; from those that hath not, shall be taken [what little they hath].&quot;
    Therefore, &quot;McWorld is [not] in competition with [but itself generates] the forces of
    global breakdown, national dissolution, and centrifugal corruption,&quot; in short Jihad
    Lebanonization. </p>
    <p>As part and parcel of the one McWorld economic crisis, especially since the 1979-82
    recession and during the 1980s &quot;recovery,&quot; per capita national income declined
    25 percent in Africa and nearly 15 percent in Latin America, which were thrust into a
    depression worse than that of the 1930s. Now the ex &quot;socialist&quot; former Soviet
    Union and Eastern Europe are joining this depression also as a direct result of the
    decline in the price of oil and the debt crisis since 1981, as well as the Reaganomic arms
    race to star wars, and the renewed world recession of the 1990s. </p>
    <p>Reaganomic deficit spending kept not only the American but the whole Western economy
    afloat in the 1980s through global military Keynesianism. However, this McWorld policy was
    at the cost of depression in all of Africa and Latin America, parts of Asia and the Middle
    East, and most of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, which it bankrupted. Reaganomics
    would also have bankrupted the American economy, were it not for the subsidies through the
    capital inflow from some of these and Western Europe and Japan, which were not available
    to the &quot;socialist&quot; economies. </p>
    <p>However, the American economy is now also threatened with similar bankruptcy as this
    inflow of capital disappears in the recession or depression of the 1990s: In Japan, the
    recession and deflationary crash in stock and real estate prices have obliged its
    financial institutions now to repatriate more capital to Japan than it exports. In
    Germany, far from causing the present recession as the populist myth has it, reunification
    first postponed and still obfuscates the cause of the recession: First, the western
    carpetbagger conquest of the eastern market through reunification maintained effective
    demand longer than elsewhere in the West. However, this demand was temporarily maintained
    for West German [and European] firms through a German version of &quot;Reaganomic&quot;
    fiscal deficit finance in the East, which obliged the German rate of interest to rise to
    permit the state to attract private capital. Thus, both the new recession generated
    Japanese and the German competition for capital also draw capital away from the American
    economy and its U.S. government. Yet for both of the latter this capital has become a
    habit forming fix, the withdrawal symptoms from which can only spell political disaster
    for the United States and the world. No wonder that in the same July 13 IHT like so many
    others in recent days, Friedman can lament the failure of last week's Munich economic
    summit -- without however analyzing either the causes nor the probable disasterous
    consequences of that failure. </p>
    <p>Thus the legacy of global Reaganomics is now aggravated again by the renewed present
    world wide recession or perhaps depression. The political events in the East since 1989
    were the direct result of [McWorld economic crisis generated] economic decline in these
    regions. Now economic depression is hitting them too. In 1990, production declined by 20
    per cent in Eastern Europe and by nearly 10 percent in the Soviet Union. In 1991, that
    decline was by some 20 percent again in both, and in 1992 it threatens to do so once
    again. Among and within all the above named, the hardest hit are the weakest and poorest
    population segments and regions, such as those in declining industrial regions and in the
    former Soviet Central Asia, where unemployment rose to over 20 percent before recent
    events to which it contributed. In the former Jugoslavia, today's terrible civil war is
    the direct consequence of the economic and debt crisis of the 1980s. An alternative
    Western policy could have lessened the debt's sociopolitical ravages and avoided
    Jugoslavia's dismemberment and civil war. </p>
    <p>Of course, this world wide economic polarizing and immiserating process was not
    confined to the above mentioned regions. The same economic polarization and immiserization
    and resulting communal &quot;identity&quot; crises also visited the rust belt and inner
    city slums in the United States [as illustrated by the burning of South Central Los
    Angeles]; the north of the United Kingdom, including Scotland [renewed independence fever]
    and Northern Ireland [increased communal strife]; and even the Ruhr and north as well as
    other parts of Germany and the south of France [&quot;foreigners out&quot;], among many
    other parts of the &quot;rich&quot; industrial parts of the world. </p>
    <p>The same July 13, 1992 IHT front page also carry two articles on Japan and East Asia.
    One by the IHT's Michel Richardson relies heavily on Francis Fukuyama of &quot;the end of
    history&quot; fame. The other by the Washington Post's Paul Blustein recounts how the
    Japanese have fallen on hard times. Unfortunately of course, the real McWorld connection
    between the two headlines and reports is not made by the IHT but is left for us to make:
    At the top of the page, now &quot;East Asia Spurns West's Cultural Model&quot; and
    supposedly reverts to Confuscianism. However, Blustein and Fukuyama fail to tell us that
    this counter-reaction now occurs precisely because &quot;Japan's Lean Times Hit Home&quot;
    due to its present economic recession, as is reported at the bottom of the page. However
    more than the revival of Confuscianism or Fukuyama's liberalism, war and radical right
    populist politics and dicatorships, not to mention anti-feminist and women backlashes and
    rabid racism and ethnocide, around the world is what is now threatening &quot;the end of
    history&quot; as we knew it since World War II. </p>
    <p>It is little wonder then that Mr. Barber can also observe fragmentation tendencies
    among regions and peoples -- and &quot;good riddance&quot; tendencies among those who
    regard themselves as burdened by state &quot;welfare&quot; transfer payments from
    relatively rich to absolutely poor. In each of these, people seek to [re?]establish their
    own &quot;identity&quot; and to use it to monopolize ever scarcer economic resources for
    &quot;us&quot; and/or to deny access to the same to &quot;them&quot; within the same
    global, regional and local economy of McWorld. In this process of course, both
    globalization and the fragmentation it generates undermine and threaten democracy, as Mr.
    Barber righlty observes. Moreover, the inroads of transnational markets and McWorld
    economic crisis render not only national markets but also national democracy vulnerable,
    if not altogether ineffective, as an arbiter of national welfare. For these same reasons
    however, the confederations Mr. Barber proposes can offer little remedy or solace to those
    who seek to dispute over the scarce resources and income of a depressed and shrinking,
    instead of uniting to share a healthy and growing, McWorld economic pie. The American
    Articles of Confederation, evoked by Mr. Barber, foundered on the world and American
    economic crisis of the 1770s and 1780s and led to the Constitution, which benefitted from
    economic recovery thereafter. That is unfortunately not yet in sight this time. </p>
    <p>Therefore, Mr. Barber's second option of bottom up grass roots &quot;strong&quot;
    democracy in civil society - or &quot;civil democracy&quot; as Marta Fuentes and I have
    termed it - offers many alternative ways of participatory organization and mobilization
    simultaneously to pursue economic and identity ends. Unfortunately in today's world,
    economic, political, social, cultural, and ideological crisis, grass roots social
    movements and their populist leaders also opt for less than civil democratic appeals,
    positions, and actions and Jihads. They range from the Metrarie, Louisiana home district
    of David Duke in the America First of Pat Buchanan to the former Common European Home of
    the former head of the former Soviet Union, Michael Gorbachev. The socio-political
    manifestations also include the threat to the Maastricht process of West European
    unification, which are posed by the present world economic recession before its resultant
    political institutional manifestations in the Danish NO vote and other second thoughts
    elsewhere. That is not to mention the other balkanization process in Europe, which
    includes the Lebanonization already of Yugoslavia and the Caucasus as previews of what may
    spread to other parts of Europe and Asia, as well as to other regions in our single but
    polarizing and fragmentizing McWorld. </p>
    <p>Barber's &quot;guess is that globalization will eventually vanquish
    retribalization.&quot; However, it has already and repeatedly failed to do so during the
    last 50 years of the &quot;American century&quot; or the last 500 years since Columbus
    &quot;globalized&quot; us all. Moreover, Gorbachev recently observed that the market is
    far older than capitalism. This market unifies but does not homogenize and instead
    simultaneously polarizes and thereby fragmentizes. Therefore, this &quot;McWorld&quot;
    market has failed to vanquish retribalization also during the last 5,000 years since
    &quot;national economies&quot; in Egypt, Levant, Anatolia, the Transcaucasus, Mesopotamia,
    Persia, India and Central Asia all became &quot;vulnerable to the inroads of larger,
    transnational markets,&quot; which joined them all in a single world system. </p>
    <p>Today, we all still live and struggle in this same system, and as per the lemma of the
    peoples of the former Portugese colonies: &quot;A Luta Continua!&quot; - the struggle
    continues. </td>

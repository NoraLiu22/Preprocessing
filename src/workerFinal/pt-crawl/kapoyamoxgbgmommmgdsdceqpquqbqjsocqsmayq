The Sabbath in Puritan New England, 1891</p>
<p class="main_body">by Alice Morse Earle, Seventh Edition, To the Memory of my Mother
Mother</p>
<h1 class="main_body">Chapter 15.</h1>
<h2 class="main_body">The Church Music.</h2>
<p class="main_body">Of all the dismal accompaniments of public worship in the 
early days of New England, the music was the most hopelessly forlorn,--not alone 
from the confused versifications of the Psalms which were used, but from the 
mournful monotony of the few known tunes and the horrible manner in which those 
tunes were sung. It was not much better in old England. In 1676 Master Mace 
wrote of the singing in English churches, &quot;&#39;T is sad to hear what whining, 
toling, yelling or shreaking there is in our country congregations.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">A few feeble efforts were made in America at the beginning 
of the eighteenth century to attempt to guide the singing. The edition of 1698 
of &quot;The Bay Psalm-Book&quot; had &quot;Some few Directions&quot; regarding the singing added on 
the last pages of the book, and simple enough they were in matter if not in 
form. They commence, &quot;<i>First</i>, observe how many note-compass the tune is 
next the place of your first note, and how many notes above and below that so as 
you may begin the tune of your first note, as the rest may be sung in the 
compass of your and the peoples voices without Squeaking above or Grumbling 
below.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">This &quot;Squeaking above and Grumbling below&quot; had become far 
too frequent in the churches; Judge Sewall writes often with much self-reproach 
of his failure in &quot;setting the tune,&quot; and also records with pride when he &quot;set 
the psalm well.&quot; Here is his pathetic record of one of his mistakes: &quot;He spake 
to me to set the tune. I intended Windsor and fell into High Dutch, and then 
essaying to set another tune went into a Key much to high. So I pray&#39;d to Mr. 
White to set it which he did well. Litchfield Tune. The Lord Humble me and 
Instruct me that I should be the occasion of any interruption in the worship of 
God.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">The singing at the time must have been bad beyond belief; 
how much of its atrocity was attributable to the use of &quot;The Bay Psalm-Book,&quot; 
cannot now be known. The great length of many of the psalms in that book was a 
fatal barrier to any successful effort to have good singing. Some of them were 
one hundred and thirty lines long, and occupied, when lined and sung, a full 
half-hour, during which the patient congregation stood. It is told of Dr. West, 
who preached in Dartmouth in 1726, that he forgot one Sabbath Day to bring his 
sermon to meeting. He gave out a psalm, walked a quarter of a mile to his house, 
got his sermon, and was back in his pulpit long before the psalm was finished. 
The irregularity of the rhythm in &quot;The Bay Psalm Book&quot; must also have been a 
serious difficulty to overcome. Here is the rendering given of the 133d Psalm:--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">1. How good and sweet to see<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&#39;ts for bretheren to dwell<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together in unitee: </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">2. Its like choice oyle that fell<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the head upon<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that down did flow<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the beard unto<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beard of Aron:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skirts of his garment<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that unto them went down: </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">3. Like Hermons dews descent<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sions mountains upon<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for there to bee<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lords blessing<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life aye lasting<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandeth hee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">How this contorted song could have been sung even to the 
simplest tune by unskilled singers who possessed no guiding notes of music is 
difficult to comprehend. Small wonder that Judge Sewall was forced to enter in 
his diary, &quot;In the morning I set York tune and in the second going over, the 
gallery carried it irresistibly to St. Davids which discouraged me very much.&quot; 
We can fancy him stamping his foot, beating time, and roaring York at the top of 
his old lungs, and being overcome by the strong-voiced gallery, and at last 
sadly succumbing to St. David&#39;s. Again he writes: &quot;I set York tune and the 
Congregation went out of it into St. Davids in the very 2nd going over. They did 
the same 3 weeks before. This is the 2nd Sign. It seems to me an intimation for 
me to resign the Praecentor&#39;s Place to a better Voice. I have through the Divine 
Long suffering and Favour done it for 24 years and now God in his Providence 
seems to call me off, my voice being enfeebled.&quot; Still a third time he &quot;set 
Windsor tune;&quot; they &quot;ran over into Oxford do what I would.&quot; These unseemly 
&quot;running overs&quot; became so common that ere long each singer &quot;set the tune&quot; at his 
own will and the loudest-voiced carried the day. A writer of the time, Rev. 
Thomas Walter, says of this reign of <i>concordia discors</i>: &quot;The tunes are 
now miserably tortured and twisted and quavered, in some Churches, into a horrid 
Medly of confused and disorderly Voices. Our tunes are left to the Mercy of 
every unskilful Throat to chop and alter, to twist and change, according to 
their infinitely divers and no less Odd Humours and Fancies. I have myself 
paused twice in one note to take breath. No two Men in the Congregation quaver 
alike or together, it sounds in the Ears of a Good Judge like five hundred 
different Tunes roared out at the same Time, with perpetual Interfearings with 
one another.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">Still, confused and poor as was the singing, it was a 
source of pure and unceasing delight to the Puritan colonists,--one of the rare 
pleasures they possessed,--a foretaste of heaven;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;for all we know<br>
	Of what the blessed do above<br>
	Is that they sing and that they love.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">And to even that remnant of music--their few jumbled 
cacophonous melodies--they clung with a devotion almost phenomenal.</p>
<p class="main_body">Nor should we underrate the cohesive power that 
psalm-singing proved in the early communities; it was one of the most potent 
influences in gathering and holding the colonists together in love. And they 
reverenced their poor halting tunes in a way quite beyond our modern power of 
fathoming. Whenever a Puritan, even in road or field, heard at a distance the 
sound of a psalm-tune, though the sacred words might be quite undistinguishable, 
he doffed his hat and bowed his head in the true presence of God. We fain must 
believe, as Arthur Hugh Clough says,--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There is some great truth, partial, very likely, but 
	needful, Lodged, I am strangely sure, in the tones of an English 
	psalm-tune.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">Judge Sewall often writes with tender and simple pathos of 
his being moved to tears by the singing,--sometimes by the music, sometimes by 
the words. &quot;The song of the 5th Revelation was sung. I was ready to burst into 
tears at the words, <i>bought with thy blood</i>.&quot; He also, with a vehemence of 
language most unusual in him and which showed his deep feeling, wrote that he 
had an intense passion for music. And yet, the only tunes he or any of his 
fellow-colonists knew were the simple ones called Oxford, Litchfield, Low Dutch, 
York, Windsor, Cambridge, St. David&#39;s and Martyrs.</p>
<p class="main_body">About the year 1714 Rev. John Tufts, of Newbury, who had 
previously prepared &quot;A very Plain and Easy Introduction to the Art of Singing 
Psalm-tunes,&quot; issued a collection of tunes in three parts. These thirty-seven 
tunes, all of which but one were in common metre, were bound often with &quot;The Bay 
Psalm-Book.&quot; They were reprinted from Playford&#39;s &quot;Book of Psalms&quot; and the notes 
of the staff were replaced with letters and dots, and the bars marking the 
measures were omitted. To the Puritans, this great number of new tunes appeared 
fairly monstrous, and formed the signal for bitter objections and fierce 
quarrels.</p>
<p class="main_body">In 1647 a tract had appeared on church-singing which had 
attracted much attention. It was written by Rev John Cotton to attempt to 
influence the adoption and universal use of &quot;The Bay Psalm-Book.&quot; This tract 
thoroughly considered the duty of singing, the matter sung, the singers, and the 
manner of singing, and, like all the literature of the time, was full of 
Biblical allusion and quotation. It had been said that &quot;man should sing onely 
and not the women. Because it is not permitted to a woman to speake in the 
Church, how then shall they sing? Much lesse is it permitted to them to prophecy 
in the church and singing of Psalms is a kind of Prophecying.&quot; Cotton fully 
answered and contradicted these false reasoners, who would have had to face a 
revolution had they attempted to keep the Puritan women from singing in meeting. 
The tract abounds in quaint expressions, such as, &quot;they have scoffed at Puritan 
Ministers as calling the people to sing one of <i>Hopkins-Jiggs</i> and so <i>
hop</i> into the pulpit.&quot; Though he wrote this tract to encourage good singing 
in meeting, his endorsement of &quot;lining the Psalm&quot; gave support to the very 
element that soon ruined the singing. His reasons, however, were temporarily 
good, &quot;because many wanted books and skill to read.&quot; At that time, and for a 
century later, many congregations had but one or two psalm-books, one of which 
was often bound with the church Bible and from which the deacon lined the psalm.</p>
<p class="main_body">So villanous had church-singing at last become that the 
clergymen arose in a body and demanded better performances; while a desperate 
and disgusted party was also formed which was opposed to all singing. Still 
another band of old fogies was strong in force who wished to cling to the same 
way of singing that they were accustomed to; and they gave many objections to 
the new-fangled idea of singing by note, the chief item on the list being the 
everlasting objection of all such old fossils, that &quot;the old way was good enough 
for our fathers,&quot; &amp;c. They also asserted that &quot;<i>the names of the notes were 
blasphemous</i>;&quot; that it was &quot;popish;&quot; that it was a contrivance to get money; 
that it would bring musical instruments into the churches; and that &quot;no one 
could learn the tunes any way.&quot; A writer in the &quot;New England Chronicle&quot; wrote in 
1723, &quot;Truly I have a great jealousy that if we begin to <i>sing</i> by <i>rule</i>, 
the next thing will be to <i>pray</i> by rule and <i>preach</i> by rule and <i>
then comes popery</i>.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">It is impossible to overestimate the excitement, the 
animosity, and the contention which arose in the New England colonies from these 
discussions over &quot;singing by rule&quot; or &quot;singing by rote.&quot; Many prominent 
clergymen wrote essays and tracts upon the subject; of these essays &quot;The 
Reasonableness of Regular Singing,&quot; also a &quot;Joco-serious Dialogue on Singing,&quot; 
by Reverend Mr. Symmes; &quot;Cases of Conscience,&quot; compiled by several ministers; 
&quot;The Accomplished Singer,&quot; by Cotton Mather, were the most important. &quot;Singing 
Lectures&quot; also were given in many parts of New England by various prominent 
ministers. So high was party feud that a &quot;Pacificatory Letter&quot; was necessary, 
which was probably written by Cotton Mather, and which soothed the troubled 
waters. The people who thought the &quot;old way was the best&quot; were entirely 
satisfied when they were convinced that the oldest way of all was, of course, by 
note and not by rote.</p>
<p class="main_body">This naive extract from the records of the First Church of 
Windsor, Connecticut, will show the way in which the question of &quot;singing by 
rule&quot; was often settled in the churches, and it also gives a very amusing 
glimpse of the colonial manner of conducting a meeting:--</p>
<p class="main_body">&quot;July 2. 1736. At a Society meeting at which Capt. Pelatiah 
Allyn Moderator. The business of the meeting proceeded in the following manner 
Viz. the Moderator proposed as to the consideration of the meeting in the 1st 
Place what should be done respecting that part of publick Woiship called Singing 
viz. whether in their Publick meetings as on Sabbath day, Lectures &amp;c they would 
sing the way that Deacon Marshall usually sung in his lifetime commonly called 
the &#39;Old Way&#39; or whether they would sing the way taught by Mr. Beal commonly 
called &#39;Singing by Rule,&#39; and when the Society had discoursed the matter the 
Moderator pioposed to vote for said two ways as followeth viz. that those that 
were for singing in publick in the way practiced by Deacon Marshall should hold 
up their hands and be counted, and then that those that were desirous to sing in 
Mr. Beals way called &#39;by Rule&#39; would after show their minds by the same sign 
which method was proceeded upon accordingly. But when the vote was passed there 
being many voters it was difficult to take the exact number of votes in order to 
determine on which side the major vote was; whereupon the Moderator ordered all 
the voters to go out of the seats and stand in the alleys and then those that 
were for Deacon Marshalls way should go into the mens seats and those that were 
for Mr. Beals way should go into the womens seat and after much objections made 
against that way, which prevailed not with the Moderator, it was complied with, 
and then the Moderator desired that those that were of the mind that the way to 
be practiced for singing for the future on the Sabbath &amp;c should be the way sung 
by Deacon Marshall as aforesaid would signify the same by holding up their hands 
and be counted, and then the Moderator and myself went and counted the voters 
and the Moderator asked me how many there was. I answered 42 and he said there 
was 63 or 64 and then we both counted again and agreed the number being 43. Then 
the Moderator was about to count the number of votes for Mr. Beals way of 
Singing called &#39;by Rule&#39; but it was offered whether it would not be better to 
order the voters to pass out of the Meeting House door and there be counted who 
did accordingly and their number was 44 or 45. Then the Moderator proceeded and 
desired that those who were for singing in Public the way that Mr. Beal taught 
would draw out of their seats and pass out of the door and be counted. They 
replied they were ready to show their minds in any proper way where they were if 
they might be directed thereto but would not go out of the door to do the same 
and desired that they might be led to a vote where they were and they were ready 
to show their minds which the Moderator refused to do and thereupon declared 
that it was voted that Deacon Marshalls way of singing called the &#39;Old Way&#39; 
should be sung in Publick for the future and ordered me to record the same as 
the vote of the Said Society which I refused to do under the circumstances 
thereof and have recorded the facts and proceedings.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">Good old lining, droning Deacon Marshall! though you were 
dead and gone, you and your years of psalm-singings were not forgotten. You 
lived, an idealized memory of pure and pious harmony, in the hearts of your old 
church friends. Warmly did they fight for your &quot;way of singing;&quot; with most 
undeniable and open partiality, with most dubious ingenuousness and rectitude, 
did your old neighbor, Captain Pelatiah Allyn, conduct that hot July 
music-meeting, counting up boldly sixty-three votes in favor of your way, when 
there were only forty-three voters on your side of the alley, and crowding a 
final decision in your favor. It is sad to read that when icy winter chilled the 
blood, warm partisanship of old friends also cooled, and innovative Windsor 
youth carried the day and the music vote, and your good old way was abandoned 
for half the Sunday services, to allow the upstart new fashion to take control.</p>
<p class="main_body">One happy result arose throughout New England from the 
victory of the ardent advocates of the &quot;singing by rule,&quot;--the establishment of 
the New England &quot;singing-school,&quot;--that outlet for the pent-up, 
amusement-lacking lives of young people in colonial times. What that innocent 
and happy gathering was in the monotonous existence of our ancestors and 
ancestresses, we of the present pleasure-filled days can hardly comprehend.</p>
<p class="main_body">Extracts from the records of various colonial churches will 
show how soon the respective communities yielded to the march of improvement and 
&quot;seated the taught singers&quot; together, thus forming choirs. In 1762 the church at 
Rowley, Massachusetts, voted &quot;that those who have learned the art of Singing may 
have liberty to sit in the front gallery.&quot; In 1780 the same parish &quot;requested 
Jonathan Chaplin and Lieutenant Spefford to assist the deacons in Raising the 
tune in the meeting house.&quot; In Sutton, in 1791, the Company of Singers were 
allowed to sit together, and $13 was voted to pay for &quot;larning to sing by Rule.&quot; 
The Roxbury &quot;First Church&quot; voted in 1770 &quot;three seats in the back gallery for 
those inclined to sit together for the purpose of singing&quot; The church in 
Hanover, in 1742, took a vote to see whether the &quot;church will sing in the new 
way&quot; and appoint a tuner. In Woodbury, Connecticut, in 1750 the singers &quot;may 
sitt up Galery all day if they please but to keep to there own seat &amp; not to 
Infringe on the Women Pues.&quot; In 1763, in the Ipswich First Parish, the singers 
were allowed to sit &quot;two back on each side of the front alley.&quot; Similar entries 
may be found in nearly every record of New England churches in the middle or 
latter part of that century.</p>
<p class="main_body">The musical battle was not finished, however, when the 
singing was at last taught by rule, and the singers were allowed to sit together 
and form a choir. There still existed the odious custom of &quot;lining&quot; or 
&quot;deaconing&quot; the psalm. To this fashion may be attributed the depraved condition 
of church-singing of which Walters so forcibly wrote, and while it continued the 
case seemed hopeless, in spite of singing-schools and singing-teachers. It would 
be trying to the continued uniformity of pitch of an ordinary church choir, even 
now-a-days, to have to stop for several seconds between each line to listen to a 
reading and sometimes to an explanation of the following line.</p>
<p class="main_body">The Westminster Assembly had suggested in 1664 the 
alternate reading and singing of each line of the psalm to those churches that 
were not well supplied with psalm-books. The suggestion had not been adopted 
without discussion, It was in 1680 much talked over in the church in Plymouth, 
and was adopted only after getting the opinion of each male church member. When 
once taken into general use the custom continued everywhere, through 
carelessness and obstinacy, long after the churches possessed plenty of 
psalm-books. An early complaint against it was made by Dr. Watts in the preface 
of his hymns, which were published by Benjamin Franklin in 1741. As Watts&#39; 
Psalms and Hymns were not, however, in general use in New England until after 
the Revolution, this preface with its complaint was for a long time little seen 
and little heeded.</p>
<p class="main_body">It is said that the abolition came gradually; that the 
impetuous and well-trained singers at first cut off the last word only of the 
deacon&#39;s &quot;lining;&quot; they then encroached a word or two further, and finally sung 
boldly on without stopping at all to be &quot;deaconed.&quot; This brought down a tempest 
of indignation from the older church-members, who protested, however, in vain. A 
vote in the church usually found the singers victorious, and whether the church 
voted for or against the &quot;lining,&quot; the choir would always by stratagem vanquish 
the deacon. One old soldier took his revenge, however. Being sung down by the 
rampant choir, he still showed battle, and rose at the conclusion of the psalm 
and opened his psalm-book, saying calmly, &quot;<i>Now</i> let the <i>people of the 
Lord sing</i>.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">The Rowley church tried diplomacy in their struggle against 
&quot;deaconing,&quot; by instituting a gradual abolishing of the custom. In 1785 the 
choir was allowed &quot;to sing once on the Lord&#39;s Day without reading by the 
Deacon.&quot; In five years the Rowley singers were wholly victorious, and &quot;lining 
out&quot; the psalm was entirely discontinued.</p>
<p class="main_body">In 1770, dissatisfaction at the singing in the church was 
rife in Wilbraham, and a vote was taken to see whether the town would be willing 
to have singing four times at each service; and it was voted to &quot;take into 
consideration the Broken State of this Town with regard to singing on the 
Sabbath Day.&quot; Special and bitter objection was made against the leader beating 
time so ostentatiously. A list of singers was made and a singing-master 
appointed. The deacon was allowed to lead and line and beat time in the 
forenoon, while the new school was to have control in the afternoon; and 
&quot;whoever leads the singing shall be at liberty to use the motion of his hand 
while singing for the space of three months only.&quot; It is needless to state who 
came off victorious in the end. The deacon left as a parting shot a request to 
&quot;make Inquiry into the conduct of those who call themselves the Singers in this 
town.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">In Worcester, in 1779, a resolution adopted at the town 
meeting was &quot;that the mode of singing in the congregation here be without 
reading the psalms line by line.&quot; &quot;The Sabbath succeeding the adoption of this 
resolution, after the hymn had been read by the minister, the aged and venerable 
Deacon Chamberlain, unwilling to abandon the custom of his fathers and his own 
honorable prerogative, rose and read the first line according to his usual 
practice. The singers, previously prepared to carry the desired alteration into 
effect, proceeded in their singing without pausing at the conclusion of the 
line. The white-haired officer of the church with the full power of his voice 
read on through the second line, until the loud notes of the collected body of 
singers overpowered his attempt to resist the progress of improvement. The 
deacon, deeply mortified at the triumph of the musical reformation, then seized 
his hat and retired from the meeting-house in tears.&quot; His conduct was censured 
by the church, and he was for a time deprived of partaking in the communion, for 
&quot;absenting himself from the public services of the Sabbath;&quot; but in a few weeks 
the unhouselled deacon was forgiven, and never attempted to &quot;line&quot; again.</p>
<p class="main_body">Though the opponents of &quot;lining&quot; were victorious in the 
larger villages and towns, in smaller parishes, where there were few hymn-books, 
the lining of the psalms continued for many years. Mr. Hood wrote, in 1846, the 
astonishing statement that &quot;the habit of lining prevails to this day over 
three-fourths of the United States.&quot; This I can hardly believe, though I know 
that at present the practice obtains in out of the way towns with poor and 
ignorant congregations. The separation of the lines often gives a very strange 
meaning to the words of a psalm; and one wonders what the Puritan children 
thought when they heard this lino of contradictions that Hood points out:--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;The Lord will come and He will not,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">and after singing that line through heard the second 
line,--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;Keep silence, but speak out.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">Many new psalm-books appeared about the time of the 
Revolutionary War, and many church petitions have been preserved asking 
permission to use the new and more melodious psalm and hymn books. Books of 
instruction also abounded,--books in which the notes were not printed on the 
staff, and books in which there were staffs but no notes, only letters or other 
characters (these were called &quot;dunce notes&quot;); books, too, in which the notes 
were printed so thickly that they could scarcely be distinguished one from the 
other.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;A dotted tribe with ebon heads<br>
	That climb the slender fence along,<br>
	As black as ink, as thick as weeds,<br>
	Ye little Africans of song.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">One book--perhaps the worst, since it was the most 
pretentious--was &quot;The Compleat Melody or Harmony of Sion,&quot; by William 
Tansur,--&quot;Ingenious Tans&#39;ur Skilled in Musicks Art.&quot; It was a most superficial, 
pedantic, and bewildering composition. The musical instruction was given in the 
form of a series of ill-spelled dialogues between a teacher and pupil, 
interspersed with occasional miserable rhymes. It was ill-expressed at best, and 
such musical terms as &quot;Rations of Concords,&quot; &quot;Trilloes,&quot; &quot;Trifdiapasons,&quot; 
&quot;Leaps,&quot; &quot;Binding cadences,&quot; &quot;Disallowances,&quot; &quot;Canons,&quot; &quot;Prime Flower of 
Florid,&quot; &quot;Consecutions of Perfects,&quot; and &quot;Figurates,&quot; make the book exceedingly 
difficult of comprehension to the average reader, though possibly not to a 
student of obsolete musical phraseology.</p>
<p class="main_body">A side skirmish on the music field was at this time fought 
between the treble and the tenor parts. Ravenscroft&#39;s Psalms and Walter&#39;s book 
had given the melody, or plain-song, to the tenor. This had, of course, thrown 
additional difficulties in the way of good singing; but when once the trebles 
obtained the leading part, after the customary bitter opposition, the improved 
singing approved the victory.</p>
<p class="main_body">Many objections, too, were made to the introduction of 
&quot;triple-time&quot; tunes. It gave great offence to the older Puritans, who wished to 
drawl out all the notes of uniform length; and some persons thought that marking 
and accenting the measure was a step toward the &quot;Scarlet Woman.&quot; The time was 
called derisively, &quot;a long leg and a short one.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">These old bigots must have been paralyzed at the new style 
of psalm-singing which was invented and introduced by a Massachusetts tanner and 
singing-master named Billings, and which was suggested, doubtless, by the 
English anthems. It spread through the choirs of colonial villages and towns 
like wild-fire, and was called &quot;fuguing.&quot; Mr. Billings&#39; &quot;Fuguing Psalm Singer&quot; 
was published in 1770. It is a dingy, ill-printed book with a comically 
illustrated frontispiece, long pages of instruction, and this motto:--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;O, praise the Lord with one consent<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this grand design<br>
	Let Britain and the Colonies<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Unanimously join.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">The succeeding hymn-books, and the patriotic hymns of 
Billings in post-Revolutionary years have no hint of &quot;Britain&quot; in them. The 
names &quot;Federal Harmony,&quot; &quot;Columbian Harmony,&quot; &quot;Continental Harmony,&quot; &quot;Columbian 
Repository,&quot; and &quot;United States Sacred Harmony&quot; show the new nation. Billings 
also published the &quot;Psalm Singer&#39;s Amusement,&quot; and other singing-books. The 
shades of Cotton, of Sewall, of Mather must have groaned aloud at the 
suggestions, instructions, and actions of this unregenerate, daring, and 
&quot;amusing&quot; leader of church-singing.</p>
<p class="main_body">It seems astonishing that New England communities in those 
times of anxious and depressing warfare should have so delightedly seized and 
adopted this unusual and comparatively joyous style of singing, but perhaps the 
new spirit of liberty demanded more animated and spirited expression; and 
Billings&#39; psalm-tunes were played with drum and fife on the battlefield to 
inspire the American soldiers. Billings wrote of his fuguing invention, &quot;It has 
more than twenty times the power of the old slow tunes. Now the solemn bass 
demands their attention, next the manly tenor, now the lofty counter, now the 
volatile treble. Now here! Now there! Now here again! Oh ecstatic, push on, ye 
sons of harmony!&quot; Dr. Mather Byles wrote thus of fuguing:--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;Down starts the Bass with Grave Majestic Air,<br>
	And up the Treble mounts with shrill Career,<br>
	With softer Sounds in mild melodious Maze<br>
	Warbling between, the Tenor gently plays<br>
	And, if th&#39; inspiring Altos joins the Force<br>
	See! like the Lark it Wings its towering Course<br>
	Thro&#39; Harmony&#39;s sublimest Sphere it flies<br>
	And to Angelic Accents seems to rise.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">A more modern poet in affectionate remembrance thus sings 
the fugue:--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;A fugue let loose cheers up the place,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;With bass and tenor, alto, air,<br>
	The parts strike in with measured grace,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;And something sweet is everywhere. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;As if some warbling brood should build<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bits of tunes a singing nest;<br>
	Each bringing that with which it thrilled<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;And weaving it with all the rest.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">All public worshippers in the meetings one hundred years 
ago did not, however, regard fuguing as &quot;something sweet everywhere,&quot; nor did 
they agree with Billings and Byles as to its angelic and ecstatic properties. 
Some thought it &quot;heartless, tasteless, trivial, and irreverent jargon.&quot; Others 
thought the tunes were written more for the absurd inflation of the singers than 
for the glory of God; and many fully sympathized with the man who hung two cats 
over Billings&#39;s door to indicate his opinion of Billings&#39;s caterwauling. An old 
inhabitant of Roxbury remembered that when fuguing tunes were introduced into 
his church &quot;they produced a literally fuguing effect on the older people, who 
went out of the church as soon as the first verse was sung.&quot; One scandalized and 
belligerent old clergyman, upon the Sabbath following the introduction of 
fuguing into his church, preached upon the prophecy of Amos, &quot;The songs of the 
temple shall be turned into howling,&quot; while another took for his text the sixth 
verse of the seventeenth chapter of Acts, &quot;Those that have turned the world 
upside down, are come hither also.&quot; One indignant and disgusted church attendant 
thus profanely recorded in church his views:--</p>
<p class="main_body">&quot;Written out of temper on a Pannel in one of the Pues in 
Salem Church:--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;Could poor King David but for once<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;To Salem Church repair;<br>
	And hear his Psalms thus warbled out,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Lord, how he would swear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;But could St Paul but just pop in,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;From higher scenes abstracted,<br>
	And hear his Gospel now explained,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;By Heavens, he&#39;d run distracted.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">These lines were reprinted in the &quot;American Apollo&quot; in 
1792.</p>
<p class="main_body">The repetition of a word or syllable in fuguing often lead 
to some ridiculous variations in the meanings of the lines. Thus the words--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;With reverence let the saints appear<br>
	And bow before the Lord,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">were forced to be sung, &quot;And bow-wow-wow, And bow-ow-ow,&quot; 
and so on until bass, treble, alto, counter, and tenor had bow-wowed for about 
twenty seconds; yet I doubt if the simple hearts that sung ever saw the 
absurdity.</p>
<p class="main_body">It is impossible while speaking of fuguing to pass over an 
extraordinary element of the choir called &quot;singing counter.&quot; The counter-tenor 
parts in European church-music were originally written for boys&#39; voices. From 
thence followed the falsetto singing of the part by men; such was also the 
&quot;counter&quot; of New England. It was my fortune to hear once in a country church an 
aged deacon &quot;sing counter&quot;. Reverence for the place and song, and respect for 
the singer alike failed to control the irrepressible start of amazement and 
smile of amusement with which we greeted the weird and apparently demented 
shriek which rose high over the voices of the choir, but which did not at all 
disconcert their accustomed ears. Words, however chosen, would fail in 
attempting to describe the grotesque and uncanny sound.</p>
<p class="main_body">It is very evident, when once choirs of singers were 
established and attempts made for congregations to sing the same tune, and to 
keep together, and upon the same key, that in some way a decided pitch must be 
given to them to start upon. To this end pitch-pipes were brought into the 
singers&#39; gallery, and the pitch was given sneakingly and shamefacedly to the 
singers. From these pitch-pipes the steps were gradual, but they led, as the 
Puritan divines foresaw, to the general introduction of musical instruments into 
the meetings.</p>
<p class="main_body">This seemed to be attacking the very foundations of their 
church; for the Puritans in England had, in 1557, expressly declared &quot;concerning 
singing of psalms we allow of the people joining with one voice in a plain tune, 
but not in tossing the psalms from one side to the other with mingling of 
organs.&quot; The Round-heads had, in 1664, gone through England destroying the noble 
organs in the churches and cathedrals. They tore the pipes from the organ in 
Westminster Abbey, shouting, &quot;Hark! how the organs go!&quot; and, &quot;Mark what musick 
that is, that is lawful for a Puritan to dance,&quot; and they sold the metal for 
pots of ale. Only four or five organs were left uninjured in all England. &#39;Twas 
not likely, then, that New England Puritans would take kindly to any musical 
instruments. Cotton Mather declared that there was not a word in the New 
Testament that authorized the use of such aids to devotion. The ministers 
preached often and long on the text from the prophecy of Amos, &quot;I will not hear 
the melody of thy viols;&quot; while, Puritan-fashion, they ignored the other half of 
the verse, &quot;Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs.&quot; Disparaging 
comparisons were made with Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s idolatrous concert of cornet, flute, 
dulcimer, sackbut, and psaltery; and the ministers, from their overwhelming 
store of Biblical knowledge, hurled text after text at the &quot;fiddle-players.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">Some of the first pitch-pipes were comical little 
apple-wood instruments that looked like mouse-traps, and great pains was taken 
to conceal them as they were passed surreptitiously from hand to hand in the 
choir. I have seen one which was carefully concealed in a box that had a leather 
binding like a book, and which was ostentatiously labelled in large gilt letters 
&quot;Holy Bible;&quot; a piece of barefaced and unnecessary deception on the part of some 
pious New England deacon or chorister.</p>
<p class="main_body">Little wooden fifes were also used, and then metal 
tuning-forks. A canny Scotchman, who abhorred the thought of all musical 
instruments anywhere, managed to have one fling at the pitch-pipe. The pitch had 
been given but was much too high, and before the first verse was ended the choir 
had to cease singing. The Scotchman stood up and pointed his long finger to the 
leader, saying in broad accents of scorn, &quot;Ah, Johnny Smuth, now ye can have a 
chance to blaw yer braw whustle agaen.&quot; At a similar catastrophe owing to the 
mistake of the leader in Medford, old General Brooks rose in his pew and roared 
in an irritated voice of command, &quot;Halt! Take another pitch, Bailey, take 
another pitch.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">In 1713 there was sent to America an English organ, &quot;a pair 
of organs&quot; it was called, which had chanced, by being at the manufacturers 
instead of in a church, to have escaped the general destruction by the 
Round-heads. It was given by Thomas Brattle to the Brattle Street Church in 
Boston. The congregation voted to refuse the gift, and it was then sent to 
King&#39;s Chapel, where it remained unpacked for several months for fear of hostile 
demonstrations, but was finally set up and used. In 1740 a Bostonian named 
Bromfield made an organ, and it was placed in a meeting-house and used weekly. 
In 1794 the church in Newbury obtained an organ, and many unpleasant and 
disparaging references were made by clergymen of other parishes to &quot;our 
neighbor&#39;s box of whistles,&quot; &quot;the tooting tub.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">Violoncellos, or bass-viols, as they were universally 
called, were almost the first musical instruments that were allowed in the New 
England churches. They were called, without intentional irreverence, &quot;Lord&#39;s 
fiddles.&quot; Violins were widely opposed, they savored too much of low, tavern 
dance-music. After much consultation a satisfactory compromise was agreed upon 
by which violins were allowed in many meetings, if the performers &quot;would play 
the fiddle wrong end up.&quot; Thus did our sanctimonious grandfathers cajole and 
persuade themselves that an inverted fiddle was not a fiddle at all, but a small 
bass-viol. An old lady, eighty years old, wrote thus in the middle of this 
century, of the church of her youth: &quot;After awhile there was a bass-viol 
Introduced and brought into meeting and did not suit the Old people; one Old 
Gentleman got up, took his hat off the peg and marched off. Said they had begun 
fiddling and there would be dancing soon.&quot; Another church-member, in derisive 
opposition to a clarinet which had been &quot;voted into the choir,&quot; brought into 
meeting a fish-horn, which he blew loud and long to the complete rout of the 
clarinet-player and the singers. When reproved for this astounding behavior he 
answered stoutly that &quot;if one man could blow a horn in the Lord&#39;s House on the 
Sabbath day he guessed he could too,&quot; and he had to be bound over to keep the 
peace before the following Sunday. A venerable and hitherto decorous old deacon 
of Roxbury not only left the church when the hated bass-viol began its 
accompanying notes, but he stood for a long time outside the church door 
stridently &quot;caterwauling&quot; at the top of his lungs. When expostulated with for 
this unseemly and unchristianlike annoyance he explained that he was &quot;only 
mocking the banjo.&quot; To such depths of rebellion were stirred the Puritan 
instincts of these religious souls.</p>
<p class="main_body">Many a minister said openly that he would like to walk out 
of his pulpit when the obnoxious and hated flutes, violins, bass-viols, and 
bassoons were played upon in the singing gallery. One clergyman contemptuously 
announced &quot;We will now sing and fiddle the forty-fifth Psalm.&quot; Another 
complained of the indecorous dress of the fiddle-player. This had reference to 
the almost universal custom, in country churches in the summer time, of the 
bass-viol player removing his coat and playing &quot;in his shirt sleeves.&quot; Others 
hated the noisy tuning of the bass-viol while the psalm was being read. Mr. 
Brown, of Westerly, sadly deplored that &quot;now we have only catgut and resin 
religion.&quot;</p>
<p class="main_body">In 1804 the church in Quincy, being &quot;advanced,&quot; granted the 
singers the sum of twenty-five dollars to buy a bass-viol to use in meeting, and 
a few other churches followed their lead. From the year 1794 till 1829 the 
church in Wareham, Massachusetts, was deeply agitated over the question of 
&quot;Bass-Viol, or No Bass-Viol.&quot; They voted that a bass-viol was &quot;expedient,&quot; then 
they voted to expel the hated abomination; then was obtained &quot;Leave for the Bass 
Viol to be brought into ye meeting house to be Played On every other Sabbath &amp; 
to Play if chosen every Sabbath in the Intermission between meetings &amp; not to 
Pitch the Tunes on the Sabbaths that it don&#39;t Play&quot; Then, they tried to bribe 
the choir for fifty dollars not to use the &quot;bars-vile,&quot; but being unsuccessful, 
many members in open rebellion stayed away from church and were disciplined 
therefor. Then they voted that the bass-viol could not be used unless Capt. 
Gibbs were previously notified (so he and his family need not come to hear the 
hated sounds); but at last, after thirty years, the choir and the 
&quot;fiddle-player&quot; were triumphant in Wareham as they were in other towns.</p>
<p class="main_body">We were well into the present century before any cheerful 
and also simple music was heard in our churches; fuguing was more varied and 
surprising than cheerful. Of course, it was difficult as well as inappropriate 
to suggest pleasing tunes for such words as these:--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;Far in the deep where darkness dwells,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of horror and despair,<br>
	Justice hath built a dismal hell,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid her stores of vengeance there: </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;Eternal plagues and heavy chains,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Tormenting racks and fiery coals,<br>
	And darts to inflict immortal pains,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyed in the blood of damned souls.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">But many of the words of the old hymns were smooth, lively, 
and encouraging; and the young singers and perhaps the singing-masters craved 
new and less sober tunes. Old dance tunes were at first adapted; &quot;Sweet Anne 
Page,&quot; &quot;Babbling Echo,&quot; &quot;Little Pickle&quot; were set to sacred words. The music of 
&quot;Few Happy Matches&quot; was sung to the hymn &quot;Lo, on a narrow neck of land;&quot; and 
that of &quot;When I was brisk and young&quot; was disguised with the sacred words of &quot;Let 
sinners take their course.&quot; The jolly old tune, &quot;Begone dull care,&quot; which 
began,--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;My wife shall dance, and I will sing,<br>
	And merrily pass the day.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">was strangely appropriated to the solemn words,--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="main_body">&quot;If this be death, I soon shall be<br>
	From every pain and sorrow free,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="main_body">and did not seem ill-fitted either.</p>
<p class="main_body">&quot;Sacred arrangements,&quot; &quot;spiritual songs,&quot; &quot;sacred airs,&quot; 
soon followed, and of course demanded singers of capacity and education to sing 
them. From this was but a step to a paid quartette, and the struggle over this 
last means of improvement and pleasure in church music is of too recent a date 
to be more than referred to.</p>
<p class="main_body">I attended a church service not many years ago in 
Worcester, where an old clergyman, the venerable &quot;Father&quot; Allen, of Shrewsbury, 
then too aged and feeble to preach, was seated in the front pew of the church. 
When a quartette of singers began to render a rather operatic arrangement of a 
sacred song he rose, erect and stately, to his full gaunt height, turned slowly 
around and glanced reproachfully over the frivolous, backsliding congregation, 
wrapped around his spare, lean figure his full cloak of quilted black silk, took 
his shovel hat and his cane, and stalked indignantly and sadly the whole length 
of the broad central aisle, out of the church, thus making a last but futile 
protest against modern innovations in church music. Many, in whom the Puritan 
instincts and blood are still strong, sympathize internally with him in this 
feeling; and all novelty-lovers must acknowledge that the sublime simplicity and 
deep piety in which the old Puritan psalm-tunes abound, has seldom been attained 
in the modern church-songs. Even persons of neither musical knowledge, taste, 
nor love, feel the power of such a tune as Old Hundred; and more modern and more 
difficult melodies, though they charm with their harmony and novelty, can never 
equal it in impressiveness nor in true religious influence.</p>

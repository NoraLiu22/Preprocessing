Notes and Comments 

<p>Provisional version by Neil Parsons April 1999</p>

<p>Botswana is a unitary state with a multi-party parliamentary
system, an executive presidency, and executive machinery dominated
by a cabinet of ministers chaired by the president. Since
independence Botswana has exhibited strong elements of democracy -
accountability of government to the electorate through regular free
elections held every five years, relatively uncorrupt bureaucracy
accountable to government, government and judicial respect for
human rights and the rule of law, and the economic underpinning of
increasing resources distributed through government.</p>

<p>Against these factors must be balanced the centralization of
power away from popular participation in decision-making at local
levels, increasingly unequal distribution of resources between rich
and poor, internal security measures introduced in the 1980s
(against subversion by South African agents), and the dependence of
the economy on the world price fluctuations of a single commodity
(diamonds) under foreign multinational control.</p>

<hr>
<p class="backto"><a name="constitution" href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>

<h2>Constitution</h2>

<p>Botswana follows a republican and presidential variant of
ex-colonial British model consitutions, which came into operation
at independence in 1966. Ultimate sovereignty is vested in
parliament through the presidency. Parliament consists of a
National Assembly of elected members (elected by universal adult
suffrage in single-member constituencies), and a handful of
ex-officio members nominated by the ruling political party. There
is also a House of Chiefs, with an advisory role on matters of
legislation pertaining to 'tribal' law and custom.</p>

<p class="backto"><a name="president" href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<h2>President and Vice-President</h2>


<p>The president is both head of state and head of government,
presiding over the cabinet of ministers drawn from the National
Assembly, and acting as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The
constitution was amended in 1970 so that the president would no
longer be an elected member of parliament standing for a
constituency. Instead the president would be automatically elected
as an ex-officio member and as president in parliamentary elections
after prior nomination by the party with the majority of members
elected.</p>

<p>The president is assisted by a vice-president. The office of the
president oversees foreign affairs, the security forces, and the
various branches of administration, while the ministry of finance
and development planning generally supervises other line
ministries. The relative power and autonomy of the bureaucracy,
particularly of the ministry of finance and development planning,
is counterbalanced by the authority of an effective cabinet style
of government.</p>

<hr>
<p class="backto"><a name="political_parties" href="#contents">Back to
contents</a></p>
<h2>Political parties</h2>


<p>The ruling party, first elected in 1965 and re-elected at
five-yearly intervals since then, is the Botswana Democratic Party
(BDP). Its overwhelming majorities in elections have been based on
rural support, stimulated by the benefits of development programmes
usually introduced in the year immediately preceding an election.
The BDP leadership is drawn from the richer strata of rural
dwellers and older members of the middle class in towns.</p>

<p>Opposition parties have drawn their strength generally from
urban areas. The Botswana People's Party (BPP) was the main but
ineffective opposition in the 1960s when urban areas were small.
Since then the Botswana National Front (BNF) has grown in strength,
largely among the working class and younger middle class in the
rapidly expanding urban areas but also including some support among
conservatives in certain rural areas. By 1989 the BNF held both
parliamentary seats and the majority of the city council of
Gaborone, and similar representation in other urban areas.
Meanwhile the ruling B.D.P. controlled the nine rural district
councils, six of them almost totally. The 1994 elections, however,
rolled back the BDP power base, with a number of seats won only by
small margins.</p>

<p>The next <a href="http://www.agora.stm.it/elections/election/botswana.htm">
elections</a> are due this year, 1999. The BNF might have been
expected to reach parity with the BDP, but it has been split in two
since 1998. The majority of its sitting MP's have formed a Botswana
Congress Party (BCP) at variance with the old BNF still led by its
founder Kenneth Koma.</p>

contents</a></p>
<h2>Local government</h2>


<p>Local councils, rural and urban, have been elected since 1969
simultaneously with national parliamentary elections. The power of
local councils is limited by the right of central government to
nominate ex officio voting members, and by central government
appointment of supervisory district commissioners and planning
staff. Local government retains responsibility for the maintenance
of local services such as primary education. Its greatest power
lies in land allocation.</p>

<p>The period since the 1970s has seen increasing privatization of
traditional communal land into residential and agricultural plots,
and livestock ranching areas, which are being fenced for security
of individual leasehold tenure.</p>

<p class="backto"><a name="foreign_policy" href="#contents">Back to
contents</a></p>
<h2>Foreign policy</h2>


<p>The political and economic alignments of Botswana's foreign
policy are indicated by the places to which it has sent resident
ambassadors - originally New York and Washington, London and Lusaka
in the 1960s; followed by Brussels, Harare and Stockholm in the
1980s, and by Windhoek, Moscow and Beijing in the early 1990s. An
ambassador in Pretoria was appointed in 1994 -- Botswana having
declined to exchange diplomats with South Africa since 1966.</p>

<p>The main hostile factors in Botswana's foreign relations after
1966 were Rhodesia until its independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, and
South Africa until the beginning of its internal political
settlement in 1990. In both cases the preceding five or six years
saw military incursions and other attempts to destabilize Botswana
by these hostile powers.</p>

<p>South Africa also attempted to obtain Botswana's recognition of
a "shadow" republic called Bophuthatswana (meaning union of all the
Tswana) - carved out of South African territory next to Botswana in
1976, and fully reincorporated into South Africa in 1994.</p>

<hr>
<p class="backto"><a name="legal_system" href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<h2>Legal system</h2>


<p>The legal system of Botswana is a mixture of Romano-Dutch and
English common law principles. There are also local systems of
'tribal' law and custom in rural district, which govern everyday
disputes and property relations but are subordinate to statutory
law.</p>

<p>The civil legal code of Botswana dates back to 1890, when the
Laws of the Cape Colony were adopted by the colonial state. The
Cape code being Romano-Dutch as modified by English common law. The
civil code has itself been modified by cases and precdents since
1890, as well as by legislation. Tswana customary law, as
represented by the laws and precedents of the eight recognised
"tribes", is also recognised in matters of property, inheritance
and personal dispute arbitration in rural areas. See <a href=
"http://168.167.13.200/newpage5.htm">UB Law Department</a> and <a
href="http://www.sn.apc.org/sangonet/SAIE/saie29/botwil.html">Women
and Law</a>.</p>

<h2>Police and military</h2>


<p>Cross-border insurgency resulted in the foundation in the later
1970s and rapid development in the later 1980s of the Botswana
Defence Force, with mobile ground forces and an air wing. See the
Canadian site <a href=

further links to Office of the President, Public Service
Management, Botswana Police, Information and Broadcasting,

1999).</p>

<p>The Botswana government's mission statement is called <a href=
"http://www.gov.bw/gem/vision_2016.html">Vision 2016</a>. The
curious title was derived from the once admired "Vision 2020" of
Malaysia, which until 1998 almost matched Botswana's record of
economic growth. The (optically unbalanced) number "2016" will be
the date of Botswana's 50th anniversary of independence.</p>

<p>The Confucian Classics is a canon of important writings reflecting the teachings of the philosopher <a href="../Classics/confucius.html">Confucius</a> (Kongzi 孔子, 551-479 BCE). Authorship was partially attribtued to Confucius himself, especially concerning the so-called Five Classics (<i>wujing</i> 五經). In fact, only a small part of the whole canon dates from the time in which Confucius lived, which was called the late <a href="../../History/Zhou/zhou-event-chunqiu.html">Spring and Autumn period</a> 春秋 (770-5th cent. BCE). Parts of the "Book of Documents", the "Book of Songs", the "Book of Changes" and the "Spring and Autumn Annals" existed already before the time of Confucius and must be deemed "ancient classical texts" which Confucians often referred to. Yet the main part of the corpus was written or at least compiled during the <a href="../../History/Han/han.html">Han period</a> 漢 (206 BCE-220 CE), when <a href="../Classics/confucius.html">Confucianism</a> became the official state philosophy and thinking.</p>

<p>The books of the canon are divided in the <i>Wujing</i> 五經 "Five Canonical Works", including the <a href="../Classics/yijing.html"><i>Yijing</i></a> 易經 "Book of Changes", the <a href="../Classics/shangshu.html"><i>Shangshu</i></a> 尚書 (also known as <i>Shujing</i> 書經) "Book of Documents", the <a href="../Classics/shijing.html"><i>Shijing</i></a> 詩經 (or <i>Maoshi</i> 毛詩) "Book of Poetry" , the <a href="../Classics/liji.html"><i>Liji</i></a> 禮記 "Records of Rites" and the <a href="../Classics/chunqiuzuozhuan.html"><i>Chunqiu</i></a> 春秋 "Spring and Autumn Annals" (the <i>Chunqiu</i> is in most cases combined with the so-called "Commentary" by Zuo Qiuming 左丘明, the <a href="../Classics/chunqiuzuozhuan.html#zuozhuan"><i>Zuozhuan</i></a> 左傳), and the <i>Sishu</i> 四書 "Four Books", including the teachings of the four philosophers Kongzi 孔子 (the <a href="../Classics/lunyu.html"><i>Lunyu</i></a> 論語 "Confucian Analects"), his disciple <a href="../../History/Zhou/personszengzi.html">Zeng Shen</a> 曾參 (505-436, the <a href="../Classics/daxue.html"><i>Daxue</i></a> 大學 "Great Learning"), <a href="../../History/Zhou/personszisi.html">Kong Ji</a> 孔伋 (483-402 BCE), a grandson of Confucius (the <a href="../Classics/zhongyong.html"><i>Zhongyong</i></a> 中庸 "Doctrine of the Mean"), and the book <a href="../Classics/mengzi.html"><i>Mengzi</i></a> 孟子 that includes the teachings of the philosopher Meng Ke 孟軻 (385-304 or 372-289 BCE).</p>

<h2>The Six Classics</h2>

<p>Traditional texts speak of the "Six Classics" (<i>liujing</i> 六經 or <a href="../Classics/liuyi.html"><i>liuyi</i></a> 六藝) that consist of the Five Classics listead above and a classical book about music that has vanished. This book about music might now be part of the <i>Liji</i> as the chapter <a href="../Classics/yueji.html"><i>Yueji</i></a> 樂記 "Records of Music". If it ever existed as a separated classic is not sure. Other interpretations say that the term <i>Liujing</i> has to be understood as the "Six Arts" (like the middle-age <i>artes liberales</i>): the <i>Shangshu</i> representing royal speeches, the <i>Chunqiu</i> representing historiography, the <i>Shijing</i> representing poetry, the <i>Yijing</i> divining, the <i>Liji</i> (or <i>Yili</i>) representing rituals, and finally the <i>Yueji</i> as the <i>ars musica</i>.</p>

<h2>The Nine Classics</h2>

<p>Later scholars count nine Canonical Works (<i>jiujing</i> 九經) that add four books to the Five Classics, namely some other writings on rites and etiquette, the <a href="../Classics/zhouli.html"><i>Zhouli</i></a> 周禮 "Rites of the Zhou" and the <a href="../Classics/yili.html"><i>Yili</i></a> 儀禮 "Etiquette and Rites", as well as two early Han period commentaries to the "Spring and Autumn Annals", the <a href="../Classics/gongyangzhuan.html"><i>Gongyangzhuan</i></a> 公羊傳 commentary by Gongyang Gao 公羊高, and the <a href="../Classics/guliangzhuan.html"><i>Guliangzhuan</i></a> 穀梁傳 commentary by Guliang Xi 穀梁喜.</p>

<h2>The Thirteen Classics</h2>

<p>During the reign of Emperor Taizong 唐太宗 (r. 626-649) of the <a href="../../History/Tang/tang.html">Tang period</a> 唐 (618-907), the "smaller classics" were added and thus formed the corpus of the Thirteen Confucian Classics (<i>shisanjing</i> 十三經). The smaller classics are the <a href="../Classics/xiaojing.html"><i>Xiaojing</i></a> 孝經 "Book on Filial Piety", the <i>Lunyu</i>, the <i>Mengzi</i>, the "Doctrine of the Mean", the "Great Learning", and the semantical dictionary <a href="../Classics/erya.html"><i>Erya</i></a> 爾雅. Not counting the "Doctrine of the Mean" and the "Great Learning", because they are both part of the <i>Liji</i>, the canon of thirteen classics is full.</p>

<p>The first scholar screen, collect and compile the classical books were the Han period scholars <a href="../../History/Han/personsliuxiang.html">Liu Xiang</a> 劉向 (79-8 or 77-6 BCE) and his son <a href="../../History/Han/personsliuxin.html">Liu Xin</a> 劉歆 (d. 23 CE). Xin composed a catalogue of existing writings of the six literary categories, the <a href="../Science/qilve.html"><i>Liuyilüe</i></a> 六藝略. This catalogue lists many different versions of one single classic and thus shows how complicate it was to find out the orthodox version of a text and to what quarrels it eventually led. The books that were written on <a href="zhujian.html">bamboo slips</a> have been partially destroyed by war and other catastrophs. Until the end of the Han period, the orthodox version had won through and was <a href="../Terms/beiming.html">cut into slabs of stone</a> in 175 CE (the so-called <i>Xiping</i> <a href="shijing_stone.html">Stone Classics</a> 熹平石經) under <a href="../../History/Han/personshanlingdi.html">Emperor Ling</a> 漢靈帝 (r. 167-188). A second cutting was undertaken during the <a href="../../History/Division/sanguo.html">Three Empires period</a> 三國 (220-280) on order of the child emperor <a href="../../History/Division/personscaofang.html">Cao Fang</a> 曹芳 (r. 239-254) in 245 AD (the <i>Zhengshi</i> Stone Classics 正始石經). On the Zhengshi stone slabs, the text of the classics was incised in three different forms of characters. The third stone cutting (<i>Kaicheng</i> Stone Classics 開成石經) was made in 836 CE under the supervision of Emperor Wenzong 唐文宗 (r. 826-840).</p>

<p>The Confucian Classics had a position among Chinese literature like the bible has in the West. Scholars attempting to graduate in the <a href="../../History/Terms/examination.html">state examinations</a> had to learn, to explain and to exegete the most important of these books. For the Confucian society, these classical writings contained the basic knowledge for the state system as well as for the conduct at home.</p>

<h2><a name="guwenjinwen"></a>The New-Text and Old-Text Schools</h2>

<p>The difference between the so-called old-texts and the new-texts of the <a href="classics.html">Confucian Classics</a> developed at the end of the <a href="../../History/Han/han.html">Former Han period</a> 前漢 (206 BCE-8 CE). Until that date there was only one tradition which operated with a text corpus of Confucian Classics which was transmitted first more or less orally and then written down in the second century BCE in the then usual <a href="../Script/hanzi-writingstyles.html#lishu">chancery script</a> (<i>lishu</i> 隸書). Only with the discovery of older texts written in the seal script (<i>zhuanshu</i> 篆書) during the first century BCE <a href="../Classics/confucius.html">Confucian</a> scholars began making a difference between the new-texts used until that date (<i>jinwen</i> 今文) and the old-texts (<i>guwen</i> 古文) newly discovered.</p>

<p>In the mid-Former Han period, when Confucianism was made state doctrine and the government appointed experts or erudites (<a href="../../History/Terms/boshi.html"><i>boshi</i></a> 博士) for individual texts, a variety of alternative texts were available for most of the Confucian Classics.</p>

<p>The <a href="../Classics/shijing.html"><i>Shijing</i></a> 詩經 "Book of Songs" was available in three different versions.</p>

<p>Emperor Wu set up a general professorship for the <i>Yijing</i>, Emperor Xuan had them divided into three, and the Jing Fang version was only given a professorship during the reign of <a href="../../History/Han/personshanyuandi.html">Emperor Yuan</a> 漢元帝 (r. 49-33 BCE), but this is not sure.</p>

<p>The <a href="../Classics/gongyangzhuan.html"><i>Gongyangzhuan</i></a> 公羊傳 commentary on the <a href="../Classics/chunqiuzuozhuan.html"><i>Chunqiu</i></a> 春秋 "Spring and Autumn Annals" was transmitted by Yan Pengzu 嚴彭祖 and Yan Anle 顔安樂. They had been handed down by <a href="../../History/Han/personshumusheng.html">Master Humu</a> 胡毋生 and <a href="../../History/Han/personsdongzhongshu.html">Dong Zhongshu</a> 董仲舒. Emperor Wu set up one professorship, Emperor Xuan one for both versions each. The <a href="../Classics/guliangzhuan.html"><i>Guliangzhuan</i></a> 穀梁傳 commentary had been transmitted by <a href="../../History/Han/personsxiaqiujianggong.html">Master Jiang from Xiaqiu</a> 瑕丘江公, and it is not known if there was a professorship for it. It might also have been that the <i>Guliangzhuan</i> was an old-text classic.</p>

<p>The scholarly approach of the new-text school was to use the classics with a practical purpose in government and social behaviour. It was deeply influenced by <a href="../Diverse/yinyangwuxing.html">correlative thinking</a> which saw Yin and Yang 陰陽 and the Five Agents (<i>wuxing</i> 五行) acting in nature, society and government. Minuscule events and statements were therefore interpreted as of enormous meaning and influence. Everything was seen as interconnected and centered on the ruler. Terms and names were seen as crucial points in the whole universal system. It was especially the teachings of Dong Zhongshu that were held in high esteem. His book <a href="../Classics/chunqiufanlu.html"><i>Chunqiu fanlu</i></a> 春秋繁露 "Rich dew of Spring and Autumn" is therefore treated as a semi-classic.</p>

<p>The new-text philosophers saw Confucius as a politician who compiled or at least processed the texts of the <a href="classics.html">Five Classics</a> (<i>wujing</i> 五經) with the intention to use paradigms from history to enlighten the rulers and their ministers of the present. It was especially the <i>Chunqiu</i> Annals and the commentaries <i>Gongyangzhuan</i> and <i>Guliangzhuan</i> of which each single word and sentence was interpreted as a political critique (<i>baobian</i> 褒貶 "praise and blame") of historical events. The mentioning of the personal name of a <a href="../../History/Terms/zhuhou.html">regional ruler</a>, for instance, was an expression of his virtue, and the omission of a <a href="../../History/Terms/wujue.html">title of nobility</a> was seen as a criticism. The interpreters of the new-text school saw a great meaning in each single word. When the power of the central government and that of the emperor declined in the later part of the Former Han dynasty the new-text interpretations lost their attraction and the <a href="apocryphal.html">apocryphal interpretations</a> (<i>chenwei</i> 讖緯) were en mode.</p>

<p>It was only during the 18th century that Confucian scholars again were interested in the study of the new-text interpretations of the Confucian Classics. The most important new-text researchers of the late <a href="../../History/Qing/qing.html">Qing period</a> 清 (1644-1911) is the so-called Changzhou Study Group 常州學派 under Zhuang Cunyu 莊存與 (1719-1788), Zhuang Shuzu 莊述祖 (1751-1816), Liu Fenglu 劉逢祿 (1776-1829) and <a href="../../History/Qing/personssongxiangfeng.html">Song Xiangfeng</a> 宋翔鳳 (1779-1860), as well as <a href="../../History/Qing/personsweiyuan.html">Wei Yuan</a> 魏源 (1794-1857), <a href="../../History/Qing/personsgongzizhen.html">Gong Zizhen</a> 龔自珍 (1792-1841), Liao Ping 廖平 (1852-1932), Pi Xirui 皮錫瑞 (1850-1908) and <a href="../../History/Qing/personskangyouwei.html">Kang Youwei</a> 康有為 (1858-1927).</p>

<p>In the first third of the Former Han period more and more versions of Confucian classics were dug out from different sources: From hidings in the walls of the manor of the family Kong (<i>Kongbi</i> 孔壁) that was destroyed when Liu Yu 劉餘, Prince Gong of Lu 魯恭王, enlarged his palace, from secret libraries, or from among the populace that submitted texts to Liu De 劉德, Prince Xian of Hejian 河間獻王. Those were the old-texts with the following versions:</p>

<p>The <i>Yijing</i> by Fei Zhi 費直, the Old-Text "Documents" (<i>Guwen Shangshu</i> 古文尚書), the "Songs" by Mao (<i>Maoshi</i> 毛詩), the so-called "lost rites" (<i>Yili</i> 逸禮) and the "Rites of the Zhou" (<i>Zhouli</i>), and the <a href="../Classics/chunqiuzuozhuan.html"><i>Zuozhuan</i></a> 左傳 as a parallel version of the <i>Chunqiu</i> annals. While the new-texts were more oriented to the present, the old-texts were focused on a more interpretive or even philological approach, without the large theoretical framework that tried to bind together the new-texts. For this reason the old-text school produced a lot of philological work, like the <a href="../Classics/erya.html"><i>Erya</i></a> 爾雅 thesaurus and the character dictionary <a href="../Science/shuowenjiezi.html"><i>Shuowen jiezi</i></a> 說文解字.</p>

<p>The old-text interpretors saw the <a href="../../History/Zhou/personszhougong.html">Duke of Zhou</a> 周公 as the first Saint (<i>xiansheng</i> 先聖), Confucius as the foremost teacher (<i>xianshi</i> 先師), according to his own words that he only transmitted and did not compile new books (<i>shu er bu zuo</i> 述而不作). The Confucian Classics were seen as historiographical material and not as an advice for the reform of society or government. Old-text interpreters also refrained from seeking a deeper meaning behind each single word, as the new-text interpreters did. Likewise, old-text philosophers did not see a direct correlation between human and especially the ruler's behaviour and a Celestial response in the shape of omina and portents.</p>

<p>During the reign of <a href="../../History/Han/personshanaidi.html">Emperor Ai</a> 漢哀帝 (r. 7 -1 BCE) the scholar <a href="../../History/Han/personsliuxin.html">Liu Xin</a> 劉歆 suggested setting up professorships for the old-texts and thus initiated the competitive atmosphere of the Confucian texts. Liu's argument against the prevailing new-text tradition was that their base was not complete, wrong or defective, and advocated the use of the purportedly more reliable old-texts. The academic dispute between the two school should last for the next two hundred years. During the usurpation of <a href="../../History/Han/personswangmang.html">Wang Mang</a> 王莽 (r. 8-22 CE), who preferred the old-texts, professorships for the old-texts were finally set up, including one for the lost (?) classic of music (<i>Yuejing</i> 樂經).</p>

<p>When he was overthrown and the Han dynasty refounded <a href="../../History/Han/personshanguangwudi.html">Emperor Guangwu</a> 漢光武帝 (r. 25-57 CE) reestablished the fourteen professorships of the new-text school. But he also had - at least for a certain time - established a chair for the old-text <i>Zuozhuan</i>. This was also done by <a href="../../History/Han/personshanzhangdi.html">Emperor Zhang</a> 漢章帝 (r. 75-88) who established chairs for the <i>Gongyangzhuan</i> and <i>Guliangzhuan</i>, the <i>Zuozhuan</i>, <i>Guwen Shangshu</i> and the <i>Maoshi</i>. Famous old-text scholars were <a href="../../History/Han/personsyangxiong.html">Yang Xiong</a> 揚雄 (53 BCE-18 CE), and also <a href="../../History/Han/personshuantan.html">Huan Tan</a> 桓譚 (23 BCE-56 CE) and <a href="../../History/Han/personswangchong.html">Wang Chong</a> 王充 (27-97 CE), who initiated a philosophy of realism that did away with the theories of correlation and apocryphal interpretations of the Classics. Under the scholar <a href="../../History/Han/personsjiakui.html">Jia Kui</a> 賈逵 (30-101 CE), the old-text school won more and more ground and produced famous teachers as <a href="../../History/Han/personsfuqian.html">Fu Qian</a> 服虔, <a href="../../History/Han/personsmarong.html">Ma Rong</a> 馬融 (79-166 CE) and <a href="../../History/Han/personszhengxuan.html">Zheng Xuan</a> 鄭玄 (127-200). These were able to gradually merge the interpretations and focal points of the two schools with the result that at the end of the Later Han period the antagonisms of the two schools had disappeared. Scholars of that time, like Zhou Fang 周防 or <a href="../../History/Han/personsluzhi.html">Lu Zhi</a> 盧植 (d. 192 CE), are not any more clearly classifiable as belonging to one school or the other.</p>

<p>During the late 18th and early 19th century the philological interpretation (<i>kaozhengxue</i> 考證學) of the Confucian Classics according to the old-text school was revived by the so-called <a href="../Religion/philqianjiaxuepai.html">Qian-Jia school</a> 乾嘉學派. Their discipline of studies of the Han period old-text writings is also called <i>Hanxue</i> 漢學. The most important scholars of the old-text traditions are <a href="../../History/Qing/personszhangtaiyan.html">Zhang Taiyan</a> 章太炎 (1869-1936) and <a href="../../History/Qing/personsliushipei.html">Liu Shipei</a> 劉師培 (1884-1919).</p>

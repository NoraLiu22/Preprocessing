The secondary issue is whether the "facts" contained in the flyers are sufficiently accurate to merit protection against claims for defamation and related privacy torts. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="14" id="pa14"> During a primary contest for State Senate, opponents of candidate Brian Stack issued campaign flyers criticizing him for previously hiring a person with a criminal conviction, plaintiff G.D. One campaign flyer stated that G.D. was "a DRUG DEALER who went to JAIL for FIVE YEARS for selling coke near a public school." G.D. filed a lawsuit alleging defamation, violation of privacy, and other related torts, and named as defendants the Hudson County Democratic Organization and certain individuals, as the purported authors and distributors of the flyers. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="15" id="pa15"> Defendants assert truth as a defense. G.D. had been convicted of second-degree possession with intent to distribute cocaine and sentenced to a five-year prison term. Thirteen years later, he successfully petitioned for the expungement of his criminal record. Defendants reason that G.D.'s conviction was a public fact maintained as a public record long before the expungement and that the publication of that fact during a political campaign was a legitimate exercise of their free-speech rights and did not violate G.D.'s reasonable expectation of privacy. <span page-number="283" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p283"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="16" id="pa16"> G.D. counters that the record of his conviction was expunged and, therefore, his conviction &mdash; as a matter of law &mdash; is deemed not to have occurred. G.D. submits that, after the expungement of his record, the pronouncement that he was convicted of a crime was simply false and the dissemination of the expunged information violated his privacy rights. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="17" id="pa17"> The trial court denied the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The Appellate Division reversed and dismissed G.D.'s causes of action, holding that the expungement of a public record &mdash; the record of a criminal conviction &mdash; does not, for purposes of defamation and the other related tort claims, render false a public fact. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="18" id="pa18"> The issue before us arises in the realm of political discourse, where speech is often harsh and caustic, but where the constitutional guarantee of free expression is given great latitude. Although our expungement statute relieves a prior offender of some civil disabilities, it does not extinguish the truth. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="19" id="pa19"> First, defendants in this case were entitled to assert truth as a defense to the defamation and other related tort actions, even though G.D.'s conviction was subject to an expungement order. Second, G.D. has failed to establish that the flyers were not substantially accurate. Last, G.D. had no reasonable expectation of privacy that information so long in the public domain before the entry of the expungement order would be erased from the public's mind or from papers already widely disseminated. We therefore affirm the Appellate Division's dismissal of G.D.'s claims on summary judgment. </p> <h3> I.</h3> <h3> A.</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="22" id="pa22"> In 1991, G.D., a resident of Union City, was charged in a three-count Hudson County indictment with possession of a controlled dangerous substance (cocaine), possession with intent to distribute <span page-number="284" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p284"></span> cocaine, and distribution of cocaine.<a note-disclosure="1" href="#6c3120fc-7fac-4939-9f1b-4ba0a890d830-fn1"></a> He pled guilty to second-degree possession with intent to distribute cocaine and, on January 8, 1993, was sentenced to a five-year (flat) state-prison term.<a note-disclosure="2" href="#f86a8d18-213f-4db9-ac22-807d302015af-fn2"></a> The remaining charges were dismissed.

G.D. claimed that the flyers damaged his reputation and caused him severe emotional harm, entitling him to compensatory and punitive damages. On May 14, 2008, G.D. filed a second complaint concerning the same two flyers, seeking compensatory and punitive damages and naming as defendants: Craig Guy; Howard Demellier, Jr.; Raul (Rudy) Garcia and his wife, Nicole Harrison-Garcia; Richard and CareyAnn Shaftan; and Mountaintop Media. This second complaint asserted claims for libel, casting G.D. in a false light, misappropriating his name and image, improper publication of private facts, invasion of privacy, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="73" id="pa73"> The trial court consolidated the two actions and, with the parties' consent, entered an order both sealing the pleadings and directing the parties to maintain the confidentiality of documents submitted to the court. Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that because the alleged defamatory statements were true, G.D. could not obtain relief on any of his claims. G.D. argued that the expunged conviction, as a matter of law, was a "non-event" and "deemed not to have occurred," and therefore he moved to bar defendants from asserting truth as a defense. He also sought partial summary judgment on the ground that the flyers were defamatory per se. </p> <h3> C.</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="75" id="pa75"> The trial court denied defendants' and G.D.'s motions, substantially because the discovery process was in its incipient stage &mdash; there were no depositions &mdash; and therefore the court could not "adequately address the actual events leading up to the alleged defamatory flyer[s]." The court made some preliminary observations <span page-number="288" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p288"></span> based on the summary-judgment record before it: that G.D. was either a public figure or involved in a matter of public concern, that a court cannot "erase the memories of the general public who have knowledge of the criminal acts prior to the expungement," and that "a party does not have a constitutionally protected privacy interest in his criminal conviction even if expunged." But, in view of the uncompleted discovery process, the court came to no hard conclusions. Indeed, "given the proper set of circumstances, i.e., improper procurement of [G.D.'s] criminal history," the court noted that defendants may be liable for defamation. Moreover, the court reserved judgment whether defendants "would have been under an obligation not to publish" the events contained in the expunged records if they knew that G.D.'s criminal history had been expunged.<a note-disclosure="6" href="#70ea25f9-5324-4435-b9be-e94932a5a0a9-fn6"></a>  </p><div note-container="6" id="70ea25f9-5324-4435-b9be-e94932a5a0a9-fn6"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="76" id="pa76"> The trial court supplemented its oral decision rendered on November 17, 2008, with a written statement of reasons addressed to the Appellate Division. <i>See R.</i> 2:5-6(c).</p> </div> <h3> D.</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="78" id="pa78"> The Appellate Division granted both G.D.'s and defendants' motions for leave to appeal and granted defendants' motion to stay discovery pending appeal.

He makes four basic arguments. First, because his expunged conviction is deemed not to have occurred under the expungement statute, <a href="/statute/new-jersey-statutes/title-2c-the-new-jersey-code-of-criminal-justice/chapter-2c52-definition-of-expungement/section-2c52-27-effect-of-expungement" class="raw-ref">N.J.S.A.</a> 2C:52-27, the publication of that conviction by defendants was a false and defamatory statement, and therefore defendants cannot invoke truth as a defense. Second, even if truth were a defense to the defamation claim, the information contained in one of the campaign flyers was not "fairly accurate" because he did not "sell" drugs, he did not go to jail for "five years," and he did not commit an offense involving a "public school." Third, concerning the privacy torts, defendants violated his reasonable expectation of privacy by publishing information about a highly personal matter that was expunged by law and therefore no longer contained in a public record. Last, the Appellate Division dismissed G.D.'s action prematurely, before virtually any discovery was taken, precluding inquiry into several areas, including how defendants came into possession of the expunged information. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="85" id="pa85"> Defendants counter that the expungement statute does not render a true statement false and that truth is a defense to a <span page-number="291" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p291"></span> defamation action and is protected under the First Amendment. Defendants maintain that the expungement statute does not obliterate the history or memory of a criminal conviction, or impinge on the right to speak freely, but only restricts use and access to the records of the conviction. Defendants also contend that the campaign flyers met the "fairly accurate" test in reporting G.D.'s possession-with-intent-to-distribute-drugs conviction. Defendants conclude that a truthful report of a matter within the public realm is neither defamatory nor violative of any privacy interest and that the Appellate Division, in the sensitive area touching on free speech, properly entered a timely order of summary judgment on G.D.'s non-actionable claims. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="86" id="pa86"> Amicus curiae North Jersey Media Group argues that, regardless of how expansively the expungement statute is read, both the First Amendment and defamation law protect the "accurate reporting of official records by the media" and prohibit the "imposition of civil or criminal sanctions for publication of true facts." Similarly, the New Jersey Press Association and its companion amici posit that truth is not only a defense to a defamation claim, but "a constitutionally protected value," and that the expungement statute cannot "erase the occurrence of events" or "transform an arrest or conviction into a private fact that would support an invasion of privacy claim." On the other hand, amicus Electronic Privacy Information Center urges this Court to hold that the "truth" about an expunged conviction should not defeat a claim for invasion of privacy and to recognize that the privacy torts are distinct from defamation. In the Center's view, an expunged criminal conviction is a private fact &mdash; regardless of its truth &mdash; and the publication of a private fact can be the basis of an invasion-of-privacy claim. </p> <h3> III.</h3> <h3> A.</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="89" id="pa89"> The facts in this case must be viewed in their proper context: statements made in the heat of a contentious political campaign. <span page-number="292" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p292"></span> We also must recognize that political discourse, even in its meanest form, is at the very core of free-speech protections. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="90" id="pa90"> With that backdrop in mind, we must determine whether the expungement statute negates truth as a defense to a defamation action when a person publishes information about an expunged conviction. In other words, in circumstances such as here, can speech about an expunged conviction, assuming that the speech is substantially accurate, be punished through a defamation action? The answer to that question requires us to determine the reach of the expungement statute and whether the expansive interpretation of that statute sought by G.D. would run afoul of the free-speech guarantees of our federal and state constitutions. And we must decide whether dissemination of information that was in the public domain &mdash; but is now the subject of an expungement order &mdash; violates a reasonable expectation of privacy. That is, are formerly public facts (an arrest and conviction) transformed into private ones by the expungement statute, thereby subjecting defendants in this case to the tort of invasion of privacy? </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="91" id="pa91"> We begin our analysis with a review of the law of defamation. </p> <h3> B.</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="93" id="pa93"> In a free society, "[t]he right to enjoy one's reputation free from unjustified smears and aspersions," <i>Senna v.</i> <i>Florimont</i>, <a href="/case/senna-v-florimont-2#p480" class="raw-ref">196 N.J. 469</a>, 480, <a href="/case/senna-v-florimont-2" class="raw-ref">958 <i>A.</i>2d 427</a> (2008), must be weighed against "[t]he significant societal benefit in robust and unrestrained debate on matters of public interest," <i>id.</i> at 491, 958 <i>A.</i>2d 427.

At the time of the Governor's veto, the expungement statute then in place provided only for the expungement of "evidence of [the criminal] conviction." <i>See L.</i> 1931, c. 345, &sect;&sect; 1 to 3; <i>L.</i> 1936, c. 174, &sect;&sect; 2, 3. The Legislature attempted to amend that statute to include expungement of records in cases in which charges and complaints were dismissed or withdrawn. Assemb. 480, 184th Leg. (N.J. 1959).

Suppose one with personal knowledge of the event were to declare its occurrence, and be sued for defamation; where would he get proof of the truth if the record were gone?

Ibid</i>, (emphasis added). That last statement suggests that the Governor understood that a plaintiff could not file a defamation action and claim that a "fact" was no longer a "fact" simply because a record was expunged.

Moreover, the breadth of the expungement statute &mdash; on its face; &mdash; is limited to those government agencies that are statutorily required to be served with the expungement order. <i>See <a href="/statute/new-jersey-statutes/title-2c-the-new-jersey-code-of-criminal-justice/chapter-2c52-definition-of-expungement/section-2c52-10-service-of-petition-and-documents" class="raw-ref">N.J.S.A.</a> </i> 2C:52-10, -15. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="117" id="pa117"> On that basis, in <i>E.A. v.

Common sense tells us that an arrest or conviction may become general knowledge within a community and that people will not banish from their memories stored knowledge even if they become aware of an expungement order. And long before the entry of an expungement order, information about an arrest and conviction may be compiled by data aggregators and disseminated to companies interested in conducting background checks. <i>See</i> <i>Report of the Supreme Court Special Committee on Public Access</i> <i>to Court Records</i> 32, 46, 53 (2007).

The suggestion that G.D.'s criminal-conviction information was posted on the Department of Corrections' website only in August 2008 seems rather farfetched.

It is not intended to create an Orwellian scheme whereby previously public information &mdash; long maintained in official records &mdash; now becomes beyond the reach of public discourse on penalty of a defamation action.

As we have explained, an expungement does not make untruthful the recitation of historical facts in the campaign flyers.

The panel took judicial notice that Union City &mdash; the identified locale of the drug offense &mdash; is a compact urban community with twelve schools. <i>Ibid.</i> Given our disposition of this issue, we need not address whether the Appellate Division's taking judicial notice of where schools were located in Union City more than a dozen years ago was appropriate.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="149" id="pa149"> To be clear, G.D. pled guilty to possessing with <i>intent to</i> <i>distribute</i> a substantial quantity of cocaine and was sentenced to a five-year prison term. G.D.'s guilty plea was an admission that he did not possess the illicit drugs for his own personal consumption. The relevant provision of the Code of Criminal Justice, <i>N.J.S.A.</i> 2C:35-5, proscribes both distribution and possession with intent to distribute controlled dangerous substances (CDS). The statutory language does not have a distinct category that prohibits selling or possessing with intent to sell CDS. It would be fair and reasonable to infer that a person who admitted to having the intent to distribute cocaine from a large cache was not acting for eleemosynary purposes. We also find that the reference to G.D. as a drug dealer is not inconsistent with the criminal charge to which G.D. pled guilty &mdash; possession with intent to distribute. That would be a fair report &mdash; substantial truth &mdash; based on a review of the judgment of conviction. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="150" id="pa150"> Last, G.D. certifies that he did not "go to jail for five years." While it may be true that G.D. did not serve five years in state prison, he was sentenced to prison for five years, regardless of when he was released on parole. As a matter of law, we conclude that the campaign flyer's statement that G.D. "went to jail for five years" is, at the very least, substantially accurate, however imprecise the flyer's language may be. Certainly, the "substance," "gist," and "sting" of that statement when measured against G.D.'s sentence cannot serve as the basis for a claim of falsity in a defamation action. <span page-number="307" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p307"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="151" id="pa151"> In short, in response to the summary-judgment motion, G.D. was required to affirmatively assert that the words used in the flyers were not substantially true. Because G.D. has not done so and has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the truthfulness of the assertions in the flyers, we affirm the Appellate Division's grant of summary judgment on the defamation action. </p> <h3> VI.</h3> <h3> A.</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="154" id="pa154"> We now address the related tort claims alleged in G.D.'s complaint that flow from the publication of the campaign flyers. The intentional-and negligent-infliction-of-emotional-distress claims also fail because those torts are predicated on the same conduct alleged in the defamation claim. At least in the circumstance here, there is "a certain symmetry or parallel between claims of emotional distress and defamation that calls for consistent results." <i>See Decker v. Princeton Packet, Inc.</i>, <a href="/case/decker-v-princeton-packet#p432" class="raw-ref">116 N.J. 418</a>, 432, <a href="/case/decker-v-princeton-packet" class="raw-ref">561 <i>A.</i>2d 1122</a> (1989). In this case, the challenged speech was not only true or substantially true, but also directly touched on a matter of public interest and concern. Because the emotional-distress and defamation claims are so closely linked together, "it comports with first amendment protections to deny an emotional-distress claim based on" a publication that does not constitute defamation. <i>See</i> <i>ibid.</i> G.D. cannot proceed on a claim of intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress based on campaign flyers that do not give rise to a defamation action. </p> <h3> B.</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="156" id="pa156"> We also agree that the Appellate Division properly dismissed on summary judgment G.D.'s false-light claim. New Jersey recognizes a privacy tort when "[o]ne . . . gives publicity to a matter concerning another that places the other before the public in a false light." <i>Romaine, supra</i>, <a href="/case/romaine-v-kallinger#p294" class="raw-ref">109 <i>N.J.</i> at 294</a>, <a href="/case/romaine-v-kallinger" class="raw-ref">537 <i>A.</i>2d <span page-number="308" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p308"></span> 284</a> (alterations in original) (citing <i>Restatement</i> <i>(Second) of Torts, supra</i>, &sect; 652E). It is not necessary to detail all of the elements of this cause of action. It is enough to say that "a fundamental requirement of the false light tort is that the disputed publicity be in fact false, or else at least have the capacity to give rise to a false public impression as to the plaintiff." <i>Ibid</i>, (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In other words, a false-light claim requires that the offending party make "a major misrepresentation of plaintiffs character, history, activities, or beliefs." <i>Id.</i> at 295, <a href="/case/romaine-v-kallinger" class="raw-ref">537 <i>A.</i>2d 284</a> (alteration and quotation omitted). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="157" id="pa157"> Because G.D.'s arguments in support of his false-light claim are essentially the same as those he advances on his defamation claim, the result can be no different. As we said earlier, although the expungement statute permits G.D. to misrepresent his past, defendants were not required to do so. The expungement statute is intended to remove various civil disabilities and to promote an offender's reintegration into society; it does not alter historical facts for either a defamation or false-light action. Moreover, the campaign flyers contained substantially accurate statements about his criminal conviction.<a note-disclosure="15" href="#cdbfa77e-c7e9-47ec-a447-7f58e90c827c-fn15"></a> This is not a case in which a defendant widely publicizes that a plaintiff was charged with a criminal offense but knowingly did not mention that the charge was found to be baseless.

Only in a footnote in his petition for certification does he glancingly make reference to such an issue concerning his false-light claim. Therefore, we do not address that issue. <i>See N.J. Div.

The point brutally driven home in the flyers was that in 2000 &mdash; six years before G.D. obtained an expungement of his criminal conviction &mdash; an elected official appointed to his staff a person with a drug conviction.

The judgment of conviction in G.D.'s case was a court record available to the public for thirteen years before the entry of the expungement order. During all those years, the information concerning G.D.'s conviction was available to commercial data companies as well as to newspapers and other public organizations. The reality is that criminal-conviction information is disseminated well before the entry of an expungement order. <i>Report of the Supreme Court Special</i> <i>Committee on Public Access to Court Records, supra</i>, at 46. Moreover, "once the Judiciary has made information available to a requester, it no longer has control of that information." <i>Ibid.</i> Indeed, in the Public-Access-to-Court-Records report, we recognized that the "expungement of criminal records could become meaningless since previously re-leased conviction information is published in databases which the Judiciary has no power to update or correct." <i>Id.</i> at 53; <i>cf.</i> Asbury Park Press, http://php.app.com/njsen/search.php (last visited Jan. 14, 2011) (posting criminal-conviction information online).

G.D.'s conviction was not a hidden secret; the expungement did not expurgate his past. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="165" id="pa165"> A number of courts have found that an offender has no protected privacy interest in expunged criminal records. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <i>Eagle v.

With regard to New Jersey's expungement statute, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has noted that "because expungement is available only after a minimum statutory period of ten years has elapsed, and because references to a defendant's criminal conduct may persist in public news sources after expungement, the information <span page-number="311" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p311"></span> expunged is never truly 'private.'" <i>Nunez v.</i> <i>Packman</i>, <a href="/case/nunez-v-pachman-2#p229" class="raw-ref">578 <i>F.</i>3d 228, 229</a> (3d Cir. 2009).<a note-disclosure="16" href="#d775f36b-9eea-4065-9e46-25fe31550f2b-fn16"></a> The Eighth Circuit has recognized that an expungement statute cannot "permanently erase from the public record those affairs that take place in open court," and that "no governmental body holds the power to nullify [a] historical fact." <i>Eagle,</i> <i>supra</i>, 88 <i>F.</i>3d at 626-27.  </p><div note-container="16" id="d775f36b-9eea-4065-9e46-25fe31550f2b-fn16"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="166" id="pa166"> The Third Circuit declined to consider whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in expunged criminal records as a matter of state constitutional law. <i>Nunez, supra</i>, 578 <i>F.</i>2d at 229.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="167" id="pa167"> This is not a case in which a defendant peered through closed curtains into a bedroom or wrongly acquired a personal diary and made highly private information available to the public. A person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the sanctity of his or her bedroom and personal diary from peeping toms intent on making private facts titillating fodder for the public. This case, however, deals with public acts, a guilty plea and sentence in a public courtroom, and public facts, court records available to the public over many years. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="168" id="pa168"> We hold that the expungement order did not and could not create a reasonable expectation of privacy in matters so long in the public domain. Accordingly, the Appellate Division correctly entered summary judgment on those claims. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="169" id="pa169"> We also conclude that defendants did not commit the tort of misappropriation of G.D.'s name and image because the use of his name and image in the campaign flyers was not for a commercial purpose directly benefiting defendants. <i>See</i> <i>Bisbee, supra</i>, <a href="/case/bisbee-v-john-c-conover-agency#p342" class="raw-ref">186 <i>N.J.Super.</i> at 342</a>, <a href="/case/bisbee-v-john-c-conover-agency" class="raw-ref">452 <i>A.</i>2d 689</a> (citing <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts,</i> <i>supra</i>, &sect; 652C) (holding that only when plaintiffs name or likeness is appropriated for defendant's commercial benefit is right to privacy invaded). That the Shaftan defendants are in the business of public relations and marketing and prepared the campaign flyers does not make publication of the flyers a publication in the commercial sense. <i>See ibid</i>, (citing <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra</i>, &sect; 652C comment d). The campaign <span page-number="312" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p312"></span> flyers represented political speech attacking the judgment of a candidate running for public office. This is the type of speech that is at the heart of First Amendment guarantees. <i>See Buckley, supra</i>, <a href="/case/buckley-v-valeo#p14" class="raw-ref">424 <i>U.S.</i> at 14-15</a>, <a href="/case/buckley-v-valeo#p632" class="raw-ref">96 <i>S.Ct.</i> at 632</a>, <a href="/case/buckley-v-valeo#p685" class="raw-ref">46 <i>L.Ed.</i>2d at 685</a>.

Am. v.</i> <i>Gandi</i>, <a href="/case/banco-popular-no-america-v-gandi#p177" class="raw-ref">184 N.J. 161</a>, 177, <a href="/case/banco-popular-no-america-v-gandi" class="raw-ref">876 <i>A.</i>2d 253</a> (2005) (quotation omitted) (emphasis added). However, for reasons already expressed, G.D. cannot establish that defendants committed an unlawful act or a wrong against him that constitutes a tort entitling him to a recovery. Therefore, G.D.'s civil-conspiracy claim must also be dismissed. </p> <h3> VII.</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="174" id="pa174"> In summary, we conclude that truth is a defense to G.D.'s defamation action, despite the expungement of the record of his conviction. We also conclude that G.D. cannot claim that he possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy about information long in the public domain: a guilty plea entered and sentence imposed in a public courtroom and recorded in documents kept in the courthouse for more than thirteen years. We therefore affirm the Appellate Division, which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and dismissed plaintiffs complaint in its entirety. <span page-number="313" pagination-id="205 N.J. 275" id="p313"></span> <i>For affirmance</i> &mdash; Chief Justice RABNER and Justices LONG, LaVECCHIA, ALBIN, RIVERA-SOTO, HOENS, and Judge STERN (temporarily assigned) &mdash; 7. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="175" id="pa175"> <i>Opposed</i> &mdash; None. </p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> <p class="empty-paragraph"></p> </section><hr> </section></div></div></section><section class="pb-5 container-fluid d-none"><div class="row"><div class="content-header col-12 col-lg-5 offset-lg-2"><div class="slogan text-muted mt-4">Summaries of</div><div class="short-title"><h1 class="mt-2">G.D. v.

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 257]]</font> The 
          theories which have been suggested by the more prominent members of 
          the Society for Psychical Research in order to explain the phenomena 
          of phantasms or apparitions of various kinds, are all founded on telepathy, 
          or thought-transference, the facts of which have been demonstrated by 
          a long series of experiments. It is found that many persons are more 
          or less sensitive to the thoughts or will-powers of others, and are 
          able to reproduce, more or less closely, any definite mental images 
          sought to be conveyed to them. It is urged that those who experience 
          phantasmal sights or sounds are a kind of thought-readers, and are so 
          powerfully affected by the thoughts of friends who are in certain excitable 
          mental states or physical crises, especially at periods of imminent 
          danger or when at the point of death, as to externalize those thoughts 
          in visual or auditory hallucinations either in the waking state or as 
          unusually vivid dreams.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This telepathic theory is held to receive 
          strong support, and in fact to be almost proved, by the curious phenomena 
          of the doubles, or phantasms, of living persons being seen by certain 
          sensitive friends, when those persons strongly <em>will</em> that they 
          shall be so seen. Such are the cases of a friend appearing to Mr. Stainton 
          Moses at a time when this friend had fixed his thoughts upon him before 
          going to bed; and those of Mr. B__ who several times appeared in the 
          night to <font color="990000">[[p. 258]]</font> two ladies, on occasions 
          when he went to sleep with the express wish and intention of appearing 
          to them.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> There are, however, difficulties 
          in these cases. The supposed agent does not usually decide exactly how 
          he will appear or what he will do. In one case Mr. B__ appeared, not 
          to the ladies he was thinking of, but a married sister, hardly known 
          to him, who happened to be occupying their room. This lady saw the phantasm 
          in the passage, going from one room to the other, at a time when the 
          agent wished to be in the house; and again, the same night, at a time 
          when he wished to be in the front bedroom, and on this occasion the 
          phantasm came to her bedside and took hold of her hair, and then of 
          her hand, gazing intently into it. Now it is an assumption hardly warranted 
          by the facts, that the mere wish or determination to be in a certain 
          part of a house at a certain time could cause a phantasm to appear to 
          a person who happened unexpectedly to be there, and cause that phantasm 
          to perform, or appear to perform, certain acts which do not appear to 
          have been <em>willed</em> by the supposed agent. This is certainly not 
          telepathy in the usually accepted sense; it is not the transference 
          of a thought to an individual, but the production of what seems to be 
          an objective phantasm in a definite locality. It is altogether inconceivable, 
          that a mere wish could produce such a phantasm, unless, indeed, we suppose 
          the spirit of the sleeper to leave the body in order to go to the desired 
          place, and that it possesses the power to render itself visible to anyone 
          who happens to be there. Let us then see whether there are any other 
          facts concerning doubles which may throw some light on this question.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Fryer, of Bath, England, heard his name 
          distinctly called in the voice of a brother who had been some days absent 
          from home. At the same moment, as near as could be ascertained, the 
          brother missed his footing and fell on a railway platform, calling out 
          his brother's name as he fell.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Similar 
          in character is the case of Mrs. Severn, who, while in bed one morning, 
          felt a violent blow on her lip so real that she put her handkerchief 
          to it, expecting to find it bleeding. At the same time Mr. Severn, caught 
          by a squall in a boat, received a violent blow on the same part of his 
          mouth from the tiller. In the first case, Mr. Fryer's brother had no 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 259]]</font> conscious wish to be heard by 
          him; and in the other case, Mr. Severn certainly did not wish his wife 
          to feel the blow, but, on the contrary, was extremely anxious to conceal 
          from her that he had had a blow at all.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
          In both these cases, if the supposed agents had anything to do with 
          the actual production of the phantasmal voice and sensation, it was 
          by some unconscious or automatic process. But the experimental evidence 
          for telepathy shows it to be produced by the conscious and active will-power 
          of the agent or agents, and would therefore prove, if anything, that 
          in both these cases there was some third party who was really the agent 
          in willing and producing the telepathic effect. This is rendered still 
          more probable by other cases of &quot;doubles&quot; and of warnings, of which 
          the following is one of the most remarkable.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Algernon Joy, an engineer employed on 
          the Penarth Docks, at Cardiff, South Wales, was walking in a country 
          lane near the town, absorbed in a calculation connected with the Docks, 
          when he was attacked and knocked down by two young colliers. His thoughts 
          were then immediately directed to the possible cause of the attack, 
          to the possibility of identifying the men, and to informing the police. 
          He is positive that for about half an hour previous to the attack and 
          for an hour or two after it, there was no connection whatever, direct 
          or indirect, between his thoughts and a friend in London. Yet at almost 
          the precise moment of the assault, this friend recognized Mr. Joy's 
          footstep in the street, behind him, then turned and saw Mr. Joy &quot;as 
          distinctly as ever he saw him in his life,&quot; saw he looked distressed, 
          asked what was the matter, and received the answer, &quot;Go home, old fellow, 
          I've been hurt.&quot; All this was communicated in a letter from the friend 
          which crossed one from Mr. Joy, giving an account of the accident.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
          In this case, whether the &quot;double&quot; was an audible and visual veridical 
          hallucination, or an objective phantasm, it could not have been produced 
          without some adequate cause. To assert that Mr. Joy was himself the 
          unconscious cause cannot be looked upon as an explanation, or as in 
          any way helping us to a comprehension of how such things can happen. 
          We imperatively need a producing agent, some intellectual being having 
          both the will and the power to produce such a veridical phantasm.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 260]]</font> The 
          next case still more clearly demands an agent other than that of any 
          of the parties immediately concerned. Mr. F. Morgan, of Bristol, a young 
          man who lived with his mother, was attending a lecture in which he was 
          much interested. On entering the lecture room he saw a friend, with 
          whom he determined to walk home after the lecture. About the middle 
          of the lecture he noticed a door at the side of the platform farthest 
          from the entrance to the hall, and he suddenly, without knowing why, 
          got up and walked half the length of the hall to see if the door would 
          open. He turned the handle, entered, and closed the door behind him, 
          finding himself in the dark under the platform. Noticing a glimmer of 
          light he went towards it, got into a passage which led again into the 
          hall, the end of which he crossed to the entrance door, without any 
          thought of the lecture which was still going on, or of the friend with 
          whom he had meant to return, and then walked home quietly, without any 
          excitement or impression of any kind, and quite unconscious till long 
          after that he had done anything unusual. When he got home, however, 
          he found that the house next to his was on fire and his mother in great 
          alarm. He instantly removed his mother to a place of safety, and then 
          had two or three hours' struggle with the flames. The adjoining house 
          was burnt down, and his own was in great danger, and was slightly damaged.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Morgan states that his character is such 
          that had he felt any impression that there was a fire, or that his mother 
          was in danger, he should probably have shaken it off as mere fancy and 
          refused to obey it. His mother simply wished for his presence, but exerted 
          no will-power towards him. What agency, then, was it that acted upon 
          his mental organization, at first apparently through simple curiosity, 
          in such a strange yet effectual way, bringing him home so promptly, 
          and yet without his feeling that he was in any way being influenced 
          or guided in his actions, which seemed to himself to be perfectly voluntary 
          and normal? We cannot avoid seeing in this case the continuous exercise 
          of some mental influence, guided by accurate knowledge of the character 
          of the individual and of his special surroundings at the moment, and 
          directed with such care and judgment as to avoid exciting in him that 
          antagonism which would have been fatal to the object aimed at. We see 
          then that, even confining ourselves to undoubted <font color="990000">[[p. 
          261]]</font> phantasms of the living, or to impressions not connected 
          with death, the facts are totally inexplicable on any theory of telepathy 
          between living persons, but clearly point to the agency of preter-human 
          intelligences--in other words, of spirits. The prejudice against such 
          a conception is enormous, but the work of the Psychical Research Society 
          has, it is to be hoped, somewhat undermined it. They have established, 
          beyond further dispute for all who study the evidence, that veridical 
          phantasms of the dead do exist; and the evidence itself--not ignorant 
          or even scientific prejudice--must decide whether these phantasms which, 
          as we have seen in my last article <em>[i.e., <a href="S430.htm">S430</a>]</em>, 
          are often objective, are the work of men or of spirits.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before adducing further evidence on this point, 
          it will be well to consider briefly, the extraordinary theory of the 
          &quot;second self&quot; or &quot;unconscious <em>ego</em>,&quot; which is appealed to by 
          many modern writers as a substitute for spirit agency when that of the 
          normal human being is plainly inadequate. This theory is founded on 
          the phenomena of dreams, of clairvoyance, and of duplex personality, 
          and has been elaborately expounded by Du Prel in two volumes 8vo, translated 
          by Mr. C. C. Massey. As an example of the kind of facts this theory 
          is held to explain, we may refer to the experiments of the Rev. P. H. 
          Newnham and Mrs. Newnham with planchette. The experiments were conducted 
          by Mrs. N__ sitting at a low table with her hand on the planchette, 
          while Mr. N__ sat with his back towards her at another table eight feet 
          distant. Mr. N__ wrote questions on paper, and instantly, sometimes 
          simultaneously, the planchette under Mrs. N__'s hand wrote the answers. 
          Experiments were carried on for eight months, during which time three 
          hundred and nine questions and answers were recorded. All kinds of questions 
          were asked, and the answers were always pertinent to the questions though 
          often evasions rather than direct answers. Great numbers of the answers 
          did not correspond with the opinions or expectations of either Mr. or 
          Mrs. N__, and were sometimes beyond their knowledge. To convince an 
          incredulous visitor, Mr. N__ went with him into the hall, where he, 
          the visitor, wrote down the question, &quot;What is the Christian name of 
          my eldest sister?&quot; Mr. N__ saw the question but did not know the name, 
          yet on returning to the study they found that planchette had already 
          written &quot;Mina,&quot; the family abbreviation of Wilhelmina, which was <font color="990000">[[p. 
          262]]</font> the correct name. Mr. N__ is a Free Mason, and asked many 
          questions as to the Masonic ritual of which Mrs. N__ knew nothing. The 
          answers were partly correct and partly incorrect, sometimes quite original, 
          as when a prayer used at the advancement of a Mark Master Mason was 
          asked for, and a very admirable prayer instantly written out, using 
          Masonic terms, but, Mr. N__ says, quite unlike the actual prayer he 
          was thinking of, and also unlike any prayer used by Masons or known 
          to Mr. N__. It was in fact, as Mr. N__ says, &quot;a formula composed by 
          some intelligence totally distinct from the conscious intelligence of 
          either of the persons engaged in the experiment.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all this, and a great deal more equally 
          remarkable, is imputed to the agency of Mrs. Newnham's &quot;unconscious 
          self,&quot; a second independent, intelligent personality of which Mrs. Newnham 
          herself knows nothing except when it &quot;emerges&quot; under special conditions, 
          such as those here described. In the same way Du Prel explains all the 
          phenomena of clairvoyance, of premonitions, of apparent possession, 
          and of the innumerable cases in which sensitives exhibit knowledge of 
          facts which in their normal state they do not possess, and have had 
          no possible means of acquiring.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is this so-called explanation any real 
          explanation, or anything more than a juggle of words which creates more 
          difficulties that it solves? The conception of such a double personality 
          in each of us, a second self which in most cases remains unknown to 
          us all our lives, which is said to live an independent mental life, 
          to have means of acquiring knowledge our normal self does not possess, 
          to exhibit all the characteristics of a distinct individuality with 
          a different character from our own is surely a conception more ponderously 
          difficult, more truly supernatural than that of a spirit-world, composed 
          of beings who have lived, and learned, and suffered on earth, and whose 
          mental nature still subsists after its separation from the earthly body. 
          We shall find, too, that this latter theory explains <em>all</em> the 
          facts simply and directly, that it is in accordance with <em>all</em> 
          the evidence, and that in an overwhelming majority of cases, it is the 
          explanation given by the communicating intelligences themselves. On 
          the &quot;second self&quot; theory, we have to suppose that this recondite but 
          worser half of ourselves, while possessing some knowledge we have not, 
          does not know that it is part of us, or if it knows, is a <font color="990000">[[p. 
          263]]</font> persistent liar, for in most cases it adopts a distinct 
          name, and persists in speaking of us, its better half, in the third 
          person.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is yet another, and I think a more 
          fundamental objection to this view, in the impossibility of conceiving 
          how, or why, this second-self was developed in us under the law of survival 
          of the fittest. The theory is upheld to avoid recourse to any &quot;spiritual&quot; 
          explanation of phenomena, &quot;spirit&quot; being the last thing our modern men 
          of science &quot;will give in to.&quot;<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> But if so--if 
          there is no spiritual nature in man that survives the earthly body, 
          if man is but a highly intellectual animal developed from a lower animal 
          form under the law of the survival of the fittest, how did this &quot;second-self,&quot; 
          this &quot;unconscious <em>ego</em>,&quot; come into existence? Have the mollusk 
          and the reptile, the dog and the ape, &quot;unconscious <em>egos</em>&quot;? And 
          if so, why? And what use are they to these creatures, so that they might 
          have been developed by means of the struggle for existence? Darwin detected 
          no sign of such &quot;second-selves&quot; either in animals or men; and if they 
          do not pertain to animals but do pertain to men, then we are involved 
          in the same difficulty that is so often urged against spiritualists, 
          that we require some break in the law of continuous development, and 
          some exertion of a higher power to create and bring into the human organism 
          this strange and useless &quot;unconscious <em>ego</em>&quot;--useless except 
          to puzzle us with insoluble problems, and make our whole nature and 
          existence seem more mysterious than ever. Of course this unconscious 
          <em>ego</em> is supposed to die with the conscious man, for if not, 
          we are introduced to a new and gratuitous difficulty, of the relation 
          of these two intelligences and characters, distinct yet bound indissolubly 
          together, in the after life.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding, therefore, that the theory of duplex 
          personality creates more difficulties than it solves, while the facts 
          it proposes to explain can be dealt with far more thoroughly on the 
          spiritual hypothesis, let us pass on to consider the further evidence 
          we possess for the agency of the spirits of the dead, or of some other 
          preter-human intelligences.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will first consider the case of Mrs. Menneer, 
          who dreamed twice the same night, that she saw her headless brother 
          standing at the foot of the bed with his head lying on a coffin <font color="990000">[[p. 
          264]]</font> by his side. She did not at the time know where her brother, 
          Mr. Wellington, was, except that he was abroad. He was, however, at 
          Sarawak, with Sir James Brooke, and was killed during the Chinese insurrection 
          there, in a brave attempt to defend Mrs. Middleton and her children. 
          Being taken for the Rajah's son, his head was cut off and carried away 
          in triumph, his body being burned with the Rajah's house. The date of 
          the dream coincided approximately with that of the death.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> 
          Now in this case it is almost certain that the head was cut off <em>after</em> 
          death, since these Chinese were not trained soldiers, but gold miners, 
          who would strike, and stab, and cut with any weapons they possessed, 
          but could certainly not kill a European on his defence by cutting off 
          his head at a blow. The impression on the sister's brain must, therefore, 
          have been made either by the dead brother, or by some other intelligence, 
          probably the latter, as it was clearly a symbolic picture, the head 
          resting on the coffin showing that the head alone was recovered and 
          buried. In a published letter of Sir James Brooke's he says--&quot;Poor Wellington's 
          remains were likewise consumed, his head borne off in triumph, <em>alone 
          attesting</em> his previous murder.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case recorded in the same volume, 
          is still more clear against the theory of telepathy between living persons. 
          Mrs. Storie, of Edinburgh, living at the time in Hobart Town, Tasmania, 
          one night dreamed a strange, confused dream, like a series of dissolving 
          views. She saw her twin brother sitting in the open air, in the moonlight, 
          sideways, on a raised place. Then he lifted his arm saying, &quot;<em>The 
          train, the train</em>!&quot; Something struck him, he fell down fainting, 
          a large dark object came by with a <em>swish</em>. Then she saw a railway 
          compartment, in which sat a gentleman she knew, Rev. Mr. Johnstone. 
          Then she saw her brother again. He put his right hand over his face 
          as if in grief. Then a voice, not his voice, telling her he was going 
          away. The same night her brother was killed by a train, having sat down 
          to rest on the side of the track and fallen asleep. The details in the 
          dream, of which the above is a bare abstract, were almost exactly as 
          in the event, and the Mr. Johnstone of the dream was in the train that 
          killed her brother. Now this last mentioned fact could not have been 
          known to the dead man during life, and the <font color="990000">[[p. 
          265]]</font> dream-picture of the event must, therefore, have been due 
          to the telepathic power of the dead man, or of some spirit-friend acquainted 
          with the facts, and wishing to give a proof of spirit-life.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take next the case of the Glasgow manufacturer 
          settled in London, who dreams that one of his workmen in Glasgow, whom 
          he had befriended as a lad, but with whom he had not had any direct 
          relations for many years, comes to speak to him, begging him not to 
          believe what he is accused of doing. On being asked what it is, he repeats 
          three times, emphatically, &quot;Ye'll sune ken.&quot; The dreamer also notices 
          that the man has a remarkable appearance, bluish pale with great drops 
          of sweat on his face. On awaking, his wife brings him a letter from 
          his manager in Glasgow, telling him that this man, Robert Mackenzie, 
          has committed suicide by drinking <em>aqua fortis</em>. The symptoms 
          of poisoning by <em>aqua fortis</em> are those observed in the dream 
          figure.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> Here the man had died two days 
          before the dream, which was just in time to correct the false impression 
          of suicide that would have been produced by the letter. The whole of 
          the features and details of the dream are such as could hardly have 
          been due to any other agent than the dead workman himself, who was anxious 
          that a master who had been kind to him when a lad, should not be led 
          to credit the false accusation against him.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreams giving the details of funerals at a 
          distance are not uncommon. As an example we have one in which Mr. Stainton 
          Moses was invited to the funeral of a friend in Lincolnshire, but could 
          not go. About the time of the funeral, however, he fell into a trance, 
          and appeared to be at the ceremony, and on again becoming conscious, 
          wrote down all the details, describing the clergyman, who was not the 
          one who had been expected to officiate, the churchyard, which was at 
          a distance in Northamptonshire, with a particular tree near the grave. 
          He then sent this description to a friend who had been present, and 
          who wrote back in astonishment as to how he could have obtained the 
          details.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> This may be said to be mere clairvoyance; 
          but clairvoyance is a term that explains nothing, and is quite as mysterious 
          and unintelligible if supposed to occur without the intervention of 
          disembodied intelligences as if with their help. These cases <font color="990000">[[p. 
          266]]</font> also merge into others which are of a symbolical nature, 
          and which clairvoyance of actual scenes at a distance cannot explain. 
          A well-attested case of this kind is the following:</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip Weld, a student at a Catholic College, 
          was drowned in the river at Ware, Hertfordshire, in the year 1846. About 
          the same hour as the accident, the young man's father and sister, while 
          walking on the turnpike road near Southampton, saw him standing on the 
          causeway with another young man in a black robe. The sister said, &quot;Look, 
          papa, there is Philip.&quot; Mr. Weld replied, &quot;It is Philip indeed, but 
          he has the look of an angel.&quot; They went on to embrace him, but before 
          reaching him a laboring man seemed to walk through the figures, and 
          then with a smile both figures vanished. The President of the College, 
          Dr. Cox, went immediately to Southampton, to break the sad news to the 
          father, but before he could speak, Mr. Weld told him what he had seen, 
          and said he knew his son was dead. A few weeks afterwards, Mr. Weld 
          visited the Jesuit College of Stonyhurst in Lancashire, and in the guest-room 
          saw a picture of the very same young man he had seen with his son, similarly 
          dressed, and in the same attitude, and beneath the picture was inscribed 
          &quot;St. Stanislaus Kotska,&quot; a saint of the Jesuit order who had been chosen 
          by Philip for his patron saint at his confirmation.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, here is a case in which phantasms of 
          the son and of another person appear to two relatives, and the presence 
          of the unknown person was eminently calculated, when his identity was 
          discovered, to relieve the father's mind of all fear for his son's future 
          happiness. It is hardly possible to have a clearer case of a true phantasm 
          of the dead, not necessarily produced either <em>by</em> the dead son 
          or the Jesuit saint, but most probably by them, or by some other spirit 
          friend who had the power to produce such phantasms, and so relieve the 
          anxiety of both father and sister. It is not conceivable that any living 
          person's telepathic action could have produced such phantasms in two 
          percipients, the only possible agent being the President of the College, 
          who did not recognize by Mr. Weld's description, the dark-robed young 
          man who appeared with his son.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This introduces a feature rather common in 
          phantasms of <font color="990000">[[p. 267]]</font> the dead: some indication 
          of happiness, something to take away any feeling of gloom or sorrow. 
          Thus, a young man is drowned by the foundering of the La Plata telegraphic 
          ship in December, 1874; and, just before the news arrived, his brother 
          in London dreamed that he was at a magnificent f&ecirc;te, in a spacious 
          garden with illuminated fountains and groups of gentlemen and ladies, 
          when he met his brother in evening dress, and &quot;the very image of buoyant 
          health.&quot; He was surprised, and said: &quot;Hallo! D__, how are you here?&quot; 
          His brother shook hands with him and said: &quot;Did you not know I have 
          been wrecked again?&quot; The next morning the news of the loss of the ship 
          was in the papers.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> Here, whether the 
          phantasm was caused by the dead man himself, or by some other being, 
          it was apparently intended to show that the deceased was as cheerful 
          and well off after death as during life.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the voice of Miss Gambier Parry was 
          heard twelve hours after her death by her former governess, Sister Bertha, 
          at the House of Mercy, Bovey Tracey, Devonshire, it said, &quot;in the brightest 
          and most cheerful tone, 'I am here with you.'&quot; And on being asked, &quot;Who 
          are you?&quot; the voice replied, &quot;You mustn't know yet.&quot;<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again, when a gentleman going to the dining-room 
          for an evening smoke, sees his sister-in-law, he says: &quot;Maggie suddenly 
          appeared, dressed in white, with a most heavenly expression on her face. 
          She fixed her eyes on me, walked round the room, and disappeared through 
          the door that leads into the garden.&quot;<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> 
          This was the day after her death. Yet one more instance: Mr. J. G. Kenlemaus, 
          when in Paris, was awoke one morning by the voice of a favorite little 
          son of five years old, whom he had left quite well in London. He also 
          saw his face in the centre of a bright opaque white mass, his eyes bright, 
          his mouth smiling. The voice heard was that of extreme delight, such 
          as only a happy child can utter. Yet the child had then just died.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> 
          Whose telepathic influence caused this phantasm of this happy, smiling 
          child to appear to the father? Surely no living person, but rather some 
          spirit friend or guardian wishing to show that the <font color="990000">[[p. 
          268]]</font> joyousness of life still remained with the child, though 
          its earthly body was cold and still.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another characteristic feature of many of 
          these dreams or waking phantasms is that they often occur, not at the 
          moment of death but just before the news of the death reaches the percipient, 
          or there is some other characteristic feature that seems especially 
          calculated to cause a deep impression, and give a lasting conviction 
          of spiritual existence. Several cases of this kind are given or referred 
          to in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research (Pt. XV., 
          pp. 30, 31). A most extraordinary example is that of Mr. F. G., of Boston, 
          then of St. Louis, Mo., who, when in St. Joseph, Mo., fully occupied 
          with business, saw a phantasm of his only sister, who had been dead 
          nine years. It was at noonday while he was writing, and she appeared 
          close to him and perfectly life-like, so that for a moment he thought 
          it was really herself, and called her by her name. He saw every detail 
          of her dress and appearance, and particularly noticed a bright red line 
          or scratch on the right hand side of her face. The vision so impressed 
          him that he took the next train home, and told what he had seen to his 
          father and mother. His father was inclined to ridicule him for his belief 
          in its being anything supernatural, but when he mentioned the scratch 
          on the face his mother nearly fainted, and told them with tears in her 
          eyes, that she had herself made that scratch accidentally, after her 
          daughter's death, but had carefully hidden it with powder, and that 
          no living person but herself knew of it. A few weeks after, the mother 
          died happy in her belief that she would rejoin her daughter in a better 
          world.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> Here we can clearly see an important 
          purpose in the appearance of the phantasm, to give comfort to a mother 
          about to die, in the assurance that her beloved daughter, though mourned 
          as dead, was still alive.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case which illustrates both of the characteristics 
          just alluded to, is that of the Rev. C. C. Wambey of Salisbury, England, 
          who, one Sunday evening, was walking on the downs, engaged in composing 
          a congratulatory letter to a very dear friend so that he might have 
          it on his birthday, when he heard a voice saying, &quot;What, write to a 
          dead man; write to a dead man!&quot; No one was near him, and he tried to 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 269]]</font> think it was an illusion, and 
          went on with his composition, when again he heard the voice saying more 
          loudly than before, &quot;What, write to a dead man; write to a <em>dead</em> 
          man?&quot; He now understood the meaning of the voice, but, nevertheless, 
          sent the letter, and in reply received the expected intelligence that 
          his friend was dead. Surely, in this case no living agent could have 
          produced this auditory phantasm, which was strikingly calculated to 
          impress the recipient with the idea that his friend was, though dead 
          as regards the earthly life, in reality very much alive, while the spice 
          of banter in the words would tend to show that death was by no means 
          a melancholy event to the subject of it.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the examples now given of phantasms 
          appearing for a very definite purpose, and being in most cases perfectly 
          adapted to produce the desired effect--examples which could be very 
          largely increased from the rich storehouse of the publications of the 
          Society for Psychical Research--the theory put forth by Mr. Myers,<sup><a href="#a">a</a></sup> 
          that phantasms of the dead are so vague and purposeless as to suggest 
          mere &quot;dead men's dreams&quot; telepathically communicated to the living, 
          seems to me a most extraordinary one. No doubt the range of these phenomena 
          is very great, and in some cases there may be no purpose in the appearance 
          so far as the percipient is concerned. But these are certainly not typical 
          or by any means the best attested or the most numerous; and it seems 
          to me to be a proof of the weakness of the telepathic theory that almost 
          all the cases I have adduced, and many more of like import, have been 
          passed by almost or quite unnoticed by those who support that view.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have one more class of evidence to notice,--that 
          of premonitions. These are of all kinds from those announcing very trivial 
          events, to such as foretell accidents or death. They are not so frequent 
          as other phantasms, but some of them are thoroughly well attested, and 
          it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that they are realities, and 
          that they are due, generally speaking, to the same agencies as objective 
          veridical phantasms. One or two examples may be given.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A striking case is that of Mrs. Morrison, 
          who was living in the Province of Wellesley, Malay Peninsula, in 1878, 
          and one morning, when awake, heard a voice distinctly say, &quot;If there 
          is darkness at the eleventh hour, there will be death.&quot; On starting 
          up in bed the same words were slowly and <font color="990000">[[p. 270]]</font> 
          deliberately repeated. A week afterwards her little girl was taken seriously 
          ill, and some days later, after a week of cloudless weather, a storm 
          came on one morning, a few minutes before eleven, and the sky became 
          black with clouds. At one o'clock the same day the child died.<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> 
          The unusual character of the warning renders this case a very remarkable 
          one.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, Miss R. F. Curtis, of London, 
          dreams that she sees a lady in black who passes her, and is then seen 
          lying on the road, with a crowd of people round her. Some think she 
          is dead, some that she is not dead; and on asking her name, the dreamer 
          is told she is Mrs. C__, a friend living on Clapham Common, who had 
          not been heard of for some time. In the morning Miss Curtis tells her 
          sister of her dream; and about a week afterwards, they hear that the 
          day after the dream, Mrs. C__ had stumbled over a high curb-stone, and 
          had fallen on the road very much hurt.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still more extraordinary is the case of the 
          Yorkshire vicar, who, when a young man of nineteen, was at Invercargill, 
          in New Zealand, and there met a man he knew as a sailor on the ship 
          he had come out in, and agreed to go with him and several others on 
          an excursion to the island of Ruapuke, to stay a day or two for fishing 
          and shooting. They were to start at four the next morning, in order 
          to cross the bar with the high tide, and they agreed to call the vicar 
          in time. He went to bed early with the fullest intention to go with 
          them, and with no doubt or hesitation in his mind. The thing was settled. 
          On his way upstairs to bed he seemed to hear a voice saying, &quot;<em>Don't</em> 
          <em>go with those men</em>.&quot; There was no one near, but he asked, &quot;Why 
          not?&quot; The voice, which seemed inside of him, said with emphasis, &quot;You 
          are <em>not</em> to go&quot;; and on further question these words were repeated. 
          Then he asked, &quot;How can I help it? They will call me up.&quot; And, most 
          distinctly and emphatically, the same voice said, &quot;<em>You must bolt 
          your door</em>.&quot; When he got to the room, he found there was a strong 
          bolt to the door, which he had not remembered. At first he determined 
          he would go, as he was accustomed to take his own way at all hazards. 
          But he felt staggered, and had a feeling of mysterious peril, and after 
          much hesitation finally bolted the door, and went to sleep. In the morning 
          about three he was called, the door violently shaken and <font color="990000">[[p. 
          271]]</font> kicked but though awake he did not speak, and finally the 
          men went away cursing and shouting. About nine o'clock he went down 
          to breakfast, and was at once asked if he had heard what had happened, 
          and was then told that the boat with the party for Ruapuke had been 
          upset on the bar, and <em>every one of them</em> <em>drowned</em>. Some 
          of the bodies were washed up on the beach that day, and the others a 
          day or two later, and he adds: &quot;If I had been with them, I must have 
          perished beyond a doubt.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what are we to say of this determined, 
          warning voice that insisted on being heard and attended to? Who and 
          what was the being that foresaw the catastrophe that was to happen, 
          and saved the one that it could save? Du Prel would say that it was 
          the second self, the unconscious <em>ego</em>, that produced this inner 
          voice; but, as we have shown, this purely hypothetical explanation is 
          both unintelligible and inconceivable, and explains nothing, since the 
          suggested cause has not been proved to exist, nor can it be shown how 
          the knowledge exhibited had been acquired. But phantasms of the dead, 
          manifesting themselves in a way to prove their identity, or exhibiting 
          knowledge which neither the percipient nor any conceivable living agent 
          possesses, afford strong proof that the so-called dead still live, and 
          are able in various ways to influence their friends in earth-life. We 
          will, therefore, briefly summarize the evidence now adduced, and see 
          how the spiritualistic theory gives a consistent and intelligible explanation 
          of it.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that any general theory of phantasms 
          must deal also with the various cases of &quot;doubles,&quot; or undoubted phantasms 
          of the living. The few examples of apparent voluntary production of 
          these by a living person have been supposed to prove the actual production 
          by them, or by their unconscious<em> egos</em>; but the difficulties 
          in the way of this view have been already pointed out. In many cases 
          there is no exercise of will, sometimes not even a thought directed 
          to the place or person where, or to whom, the phantasm appears; and 
          it is altogether irrational to ascribe the production of so marvellous 
          an effect as, for example, a perfectly life-like phantasm of two persons, 
          a carriage, and a horse, visible to three persons at different points 
          of its progress through space (as described in my first article <em>[i.e., 
          <a href="S430.htm">S430</a>]</em>), to an agent who is totally unconscious 
          of any agency in the matter. What is termed the agent, that <font color="990000">[[p. 
          272]]</font> is the person whose &quot;double&quot; is produced, may be a<em> 
          condition</em> towards the production of the phantasm without being 
          the <em>cause</em>. I write a telegram to a friend a thousand miles 
          away, and that friend receives my message in an hour or two. But the 
          possibility of sending the message does not reside in me, but in a whole 
          series of contributory agencies from the earliest inventors of the telegraph, 
          down to the clerks who transmit and receive the message.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clue to a true explanation of these very 
          puzzling &quot;doubles,&quot; as of all the other varied phenomena of phantasms 
          and hauntings is, I believe, afforded by the following passage by one 
          of the most thoughtful and experienced of modern spiritualists, Dr. 
          Eugene Crowell:--</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">I have frequently consulted my spirit friends upon 
            this question, and have invariably been told by them that a spirit 
            while in mortal form cannot for an instant leave it; were it to do 
            so, death would at once ensue; and, that the appearance of one's self 
            at another place from that in which the body at the moment is, is 
            simply a personation by another spirit, who thus often accomplishes 
            a purpose desired by his mortal friend, or some other useful purpose 
            is accomplished by the personation. I am informed, and believe, that 
            in cases of trance, where the subjects have supposed that their spirits 
            have left their bodies, and visited the spheres, their minds have 
            been psychologically impressed with views representing spiritual scenes, 
            objects, and sounds, and many times these impressions are so apparently 
            real and truthful that the reality itself barely exceeds these representations 
            of it, but these are all subjective impressions, not actual experiences.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting, then, as proved by the various 
          classes of phantasms and the information conveyed by them, that the 
          spirits of the so-called dead still live, and that some of them can, 
          under special conditions, and in various ways, make their existence 
          known to us, or influence us unconsciously to ourselves, let us see 
          what reasonable explanation we can give of the cause and purpose of 
          these phenomena.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every case that passes beyond simple transference 
          of a thought from one living person to another, it seems probable that 
          other intelligences co-operate. There is much evidence to show that 
          the continued association of spirits with mortals <font color="990000">[[p. 
          273]]</font> is in many cases beneficial or pleasurable to the former, 
          and if we remember the number of very commonplace people who are daily 
          and yearly dying around us, we shall have a sufficient explanation of 
          those trivial and commonplace yet veridical dreams and impressions which 
          at first sight seem so unintelligible. The production of these dreams, 
          impressions, and phantasms, may be a pleasurable exercise of the lower 
          spiritual faculties, as agreeable to some spirits as billiards, chemical 
          experiments, or practical jokes are to some mortals.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many hauntings, on the other hand, seem to 
          show one mode of the inevitable punishment of crime in the spirit world. 
          The criminal is drawn by remorse or by some indefinable attraction, 
          to haunt the place of his crime, and to continually reproduce or act 
          over some incidents connected with it. It is true that the victim appears 
          in haunted houses, as often as the criminal, but it does not at all 
          follow that the victim is always there, unless he or she was a participator 
          in the crime, or continued to indulge feelings of revenge against the 
          actual criminal.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if there be a spiritual world, if those 
          whose existence on earth has come to an end still live, what is more 
          natural than that many spirits should be distressed at the disbelief, 
          or doubt, or misconception, that so widely prevail, with respect to 
          a future life, and should use whatever power they possess to convince 
          us of our error. What more natural than that they should wish, whenever 
          possible, to give some message to their friends, if only to assure them 
          that death is not the end, that they still live, and are not unhappy. 
          Many facts seem to show us that the beautiful idea of guardian spirits 
          is not a mere dream, but a frequent, perhaps universal reality. Thus 
          will be explained the demon of Socrates, which always warned him against 
          danger, and the various forms of advice, information, or premonition 
          which so many persons receive. The numerous cases in which messages 
          are given from those recently dead, in order to do some trivial act 
          of justice or of kindness, are surely what we should expect; while the 
          fact that although indications are frequently given of a crime having 
          been committed, it is but rarely that the criminal is denounced, indicates, 
          either that the feeling of revenge does not long persist, or that earthly 
          modes of punishment are not approved of by the denizens of the spirit 
          world.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of communication of spirits with 
          us, and ours of <font color="990000">[[p. 274]]</font> receiving their 
          communications, vary greatly. Some of us can only be influenced by ideas 
          or impressions, which we think are altogether the product of our own 
          minds. Others can be so strongly acted on that they feel an inexplicable 
          emotion, leading to action beneficial to themselves or to others. In 
          some cases, warning or information can be given through dreams, in others 
          by waking vision. Some spirits have the power of producing visual, others 
          audible hallucinations to certain persons. More rarely, and needing 
          more special conditions, they can produce phantasms, which are audible 
          or visible to all who may be present--real entities which give off light 
          or sound waves, and thus act upon our senses like living beings or material 
          objects. Still more rarely these phantasms are tangible as well as visual--real 
          though temporary living forms, capable of acting like human beings, 
          and of exerting considerable force on ordinary matter.</p>
        
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look upon these phenomena not as anything 
          supernatural, but as the perfectly natural and orderly exercise of the 
          faculties and powers of spiritual beings for the purpose of communicating 
          with those still in the physical body, we shall find every objection 
          answered, and every difficulty disappear. Nothing is more common than 
          objections to the triviality or the partiality of the communications 
          alleged to be from spirits. But the most trivial message or act, if 
          such that no living person could have given or performed it, may give 
          proof of the existence of other intelligences around us. And the partiality 
          often displayed, one person being warned and saved, while others are 
          left to die, is but an indication of the limited power of spirits to 
          act upon us, combined with the limited receptivity of spirit influence 
          on our part. In conclusion, I submit, that the brief review now given 
          of the various classes of phantasms of the living and of the dead, demonstrates 
          the inadequacy of all the explanations in which telepathy between living 
          persons, or the agency of the unconscious <em>ego</em> are exclusively 
          concerned, since these explanations are only capable of dealing with 
          a small proportion of the cases that actually occur. Furthermore, I 
          urge, that nothing less fundamental and far-reaching than the agency 
          of disembodied intelligences acting in co-operation with our own powers 
          of thought-transference and spiritual insight, can afford a rational 
          and intelligible explanation of the whole range of the phenomena.</p>

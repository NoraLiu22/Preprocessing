        thinking the famine that had made them flee were over,
        but this isn't the case. Since the Tama villagers cannot
        feed their own families because of the 1994 famine and
        the scourge of locusts in the region, they find it hard
        enough to feed the families of these refugees, let alone
        their own families. And this is why we need help to meet
        our food needs as well as those of the refugees, as our

        diarrhoea spreads in the region, and causes many deaths.

        few youth go to school and many young people would rather

        often, there are volunteer workers without any training.
        In the entire Mogum region, only one instructor who
        learned how to teach in Ketch village. The young people

        not any schools on the north bank of the Chari River.
        Only those who live in Kokaga or in Sarh can send their
        children to school. This situation leads to the
        displacement of the Tounia to urban centres. If an

<P> 

In the "CLASS EXPERIMENT," students discover how depth perception
works by testing their ability to perform motor tasks with one eye or two
eyes.<P>

In "TRY YOUR OWN EXPERIMENT," students design experiments investigating
visual illusions, such as shadow vs. figure, length of lines, or apparent
size. They can investigate visual attention with "minimum difference
tests."<P>

SUGGESTED TIMES for these activities: 45 minutes for introducing and

BACKGROUND CONCEPTS</a></h2></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffcc">

Our visual systems allow us to resolve fine detail, track a moving object,
perceive depth, and see colors.  Somehow, all these components of a visual
scene merge so that we have one visual experience;  for example, when we
see a cat playing with a string, we interpret the scene-paws striking the
string, details of claws and whiskers, the cat's paw in front of or behind
the string, the colors of the cat-as a unitary visual event, even though
we can attend to one or the other of these individually.  How do our
brains deal with such complex visual information?  First, we will consider
theories on the processing of motion, form, and color; then we will
discuss binocular vision and perceiving depth. For a brief review of how
visual information travels to the brain, see Figure 1.  (For information
on the cells and connections of the visual system, see <a href =
"eyetr.html">Part 1 of this
unit</A>)

<td>FIGURE 1.  The visual pathway, shown in a midsaggital section (cut
in the middle, front to back) of the eye and brain.  Axons from ganglion
cells in the retina travel in the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate
nucleus of the thalamus.  Here they synapse with other neurons, whose
axons go to neurons in the visual cortex in the occipital lobe of the
brain.  (Figure courtesy of the Society for Neuroscience, copyright by
Lydia Kibiuk, 1994. </td></tr></table>
</center><p>
One possibility for how we perceive a visual scene is that a defined
series of neurons and their axons handles all information-motion, shape,
and color-from a part of the visual field in a hierarchical manner.  That
is, a defined set of photoreceptors, other retinal cells, lateral
geniculate cells, and cortical cells acts as a serial pathway for
information from a block of the visual scene. This information arrives at
a "master" cell or group of cells, in a visual association area of the
cortex, which combines the current information with memories of previous
experiences and make sense of it.   In this model, pieces of the visual
scene are transmitted like sections of a photograph to the brain.
<P>

However, evidence does not support this "photographic transmission" or
serial pathway theory, but rather a parallel pathways model.  This model
states that three primary types of information-color, shape, and
motion-are individually "pulled out" of the visual scene and sent through
three parallel pathways, beginning right in the retina. In this view, one
cone receptor receives light from a small area, for example, on the face
of a moving calico cat, and signals from this cone go to several
intermediate retinal cells and from these to ganglion cells.  Each of the
ganglion cells responds to only one of the attributes-color, form, or
motion-of the cat's face.  The ganglion cells forward their signals to
lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells in the thalamus that respond
uniquely to that one type of information (color, form, or motion), and so
on to the primary visual cortex and further cortical areas. At higher
areas, the scene is put back together again, as discussed below.<P>
  
Several types of evidence, both experimental and clinical, have led to the
parallel processing theory.  In one important type of experiment,
researchers recorded electrical responses from cells in specific areas of
"higher" visual cortical areas (where signals go from the primary visual
cortex).  Cells in an area called V5 responded only to something moving in
part of the visual field, while cells in V4 responded to color.  Second,
clinical evidence came from patients who had selectively lost the ability
to perceive one type of visual information. For example, with damage to a
particular area of the cortex, a person loses all perception of motion,
while still being able to identify objects and colors.  (For a vivid
description of this syndrome, see http://www.hhmi.org/senses ;  look under
The Strange Symptoms of Blindness to Motion.)  Such selective defects are
called agnosias:  some of these are listed in Table 1. <P>

Putting all the evidence together, researchers now describe a system that
processes motion, the where system, and a system that handles shape or
form, the what system.  The motion or where system information seems to
have its final processing station (after leaving the occipital lobe) in
the parietal lobe, while the shape or what system input ends up in the
inferior temporal lobe.  Color information is processed in a pathway that
will be considered in Part 3 of this unit. Color information also appears
to come to its final sensory analysis in the inferior temporal lobe, but
in different cells from those for shape.  From these places, messages go
out to other cortical areas-to motor systems, for example.  When the brain
detects something moving, it coordinates bodily movements through the
environment or maintains eye pursuit of a moving object.
<P>
 Finally, note that the parallel processing theory is still that, a
theory, and researchers disagree on how much overlap may exist in the
system.  <p>

<font size="+1"><I><strong>Higher cortical areas reassemble the visual
puzzle</strong></I></font><p>

Although parallel visual processing seems to fragment what we see, at
higher levels the puzzle is reassembled.  Further, the immediate visual
scene is then interpreted in light of what we know from past visual
experiences and what the wiring of our brains allows.  While our visual
experiences usually make sense to us, we are generally unaware of the cues
we are using to interpret scenes until we are challenged with
unconventional pictures such as illusions.  For example, when we see a
friend at some distance, we recognize the person and know that this is a
normal adult (or child) even though the image on the retina is much
smaller than that of a person standing right next to us.  We are using
cues from the rest of the image, noting, for example, that the trees and
buildings also appear small, and using past knowledge to realize that
these cues mean distance, not a miniature world.  When cues are not
present or confused, we can be fooled, as shown in Figure 2.<P>

<center><table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0><tr><td>
<img src = "./gif/per2.gif" width="350" height="171"></td>

<td>Figure 2.  The perceived size of an object depends on other objects
and
cues in the scene. The lines on the floor, walls, and ceiling in these
drawings tell us that we are looking into the distance, and the square at
the back appears far away. The figure of the man is the same in both
drawings, but the man in the drawing on the right appears larger. This
happens because our brains have learned to interpret the distance cues and
to assume that, in real life, the two people would be about the same size.
To convince yourself, you can measure the two figures with a
ruler.</td></tr></table></center><P>

Illusions are a window on how the brain puts together the different
aspects of visual information and integrates it with previous experiences.
The illusions presented in the Teacher Guide of this unit illustrate
higher visual processing. However, scientists do not yet know all the
brain regions and computations involved in interpreting size, shape, and
motion, and thus cannot fully explain how illusions fool us.<P>

<font size="+1"><I><strong>Perceiving depth depends 
on both monocular and binocular cues</strong></I></font><p>

Along with information on motion, shape, and color, our brains receive
input that indicates both depth, the perception that different objects are
different distances from us, and the related concept of stereopsis, the
solidity of objects.  Studies show that people have two ways of judging
depth or distance:  using monocular (one-eyed) information, and using
binocular (two-eyed) data.  Monocular cues operate at distances of around
100 feet or greater, where the retinal images seen by both eyes are almost
identical.  These cues include:  <P>

<ol>

<li>Previous familiarity: If we know the range of sizes of people, cats,
or
trees, we can judge how far away they are.
<LI>Occlusion:  If one object partly hides another, we know that the
object
in front is closer.
<LI>Perspective:  Parallel lines such as the edges of a road, the
intersections of walls and ceilings, and railroad tracks, appear to
converge at a distance.  The relative distances between objects in a scene
with parallel lines are estimated by their positions along the converging
lines.
<LI>Motion parallax: As we move our heads or bodies, nearby objects appear
to move more quickly than distant objects;  for example, telephone poles
beside the road appear to pass by much more quickly when viewed from a
moving car than do buildings or trees hundreds of feet back from the road.
<LI>Shadows and light: Patterns of light and dark can give an impression
of
depth, and bright colors tend to seem closer than dull colors.</ol><P>

Even though these monocular cues provide some depth vision so that the
world does not look "flat" to us when we use just one eye, viewing a scene
with two eyes-binocular vision-gives most people a more vivid sense of
depth and of stereopsis.  This is important when viewing objects closer
than about 100 feet.  Stereoscopic (three-dimensional) vision depends on
the fact that the eyes are separated, on average, by about six
centimeters, and thus get slightly different views of the same object.
This means that when we fixate an object (place its image on the fovea),
we can tell if another object is in front of or behind it by the
difference in location of the second object's image on the two retinas.
This difference in retinal position is called retinal disparity (Figure
3.) and is essential for stereoscopic vision.  Experiments have shown that
depth perception occurs at the level of the primary visual cortex or
perhaps higher (association cortex), where individual neurons receiving
input from the two retinas fire specifically when retinal disparity
exists.  Although scientists have located such neurons and know they are
important for merging or fusing the images from the two eyes, they cannot
yet fully explain how the brain accomplishes this.<P>

<table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0><tr><td>
<img src = "./gif/per3.gif" width="150" height="144"></td>

<td>Figure 3.  Schematic drawing looking down onto the head of someone
viewing
two objects, one indicated by the letter P and the other by the large
asterisk.  The person is looking directly at the object at P, so its image
falls onto the fovea (f in the diagram).  When the person notices the
other object but does not shift the direction of gaze, the image of the
other object falls on different parts of the two retinas as indicated by
the small asterisks on the retinas.  This retinal disparity information is
used by the brain to interpret depth and help produce stereoscopic
vision.</td></tr></table><P>

<font size="+1"><I><strong>We first scan a scene, and then we attend to
individual features</strong></I></font><p>

Finally, what we see depends on what we pay attention to.  Sometimes the
nature of the visual scene is such that one object or feature "pops out"
at us because of distinctive boundaries.  If the elements of a scene are
not different enough from each other, no one part gets our attention over
another.  Vision scientists describe two sequential processes that direct
our attention:  the first is a rapid scanning system that tells us if a
simple property is different in one or more parts of a scene.  After the
initial scan, we direct our attention to individual features of the
scene-color, shape, orientation, size-and compare each part with others to
detect subtle differences, or we compare each with a previously known
version of the scene or object.  Our ability to recognize any differences
in what appear initially to be two identical objects, or sets of objects,
depends on several factors, such as the degree of differences and previous
familiarity with the objects.  <P>

One illustration of how we can miss differences in scenes when we first
rapidly scan them is to make a copy of a photograph of a well-known person
and to carefully alter one or two aspects of the picture:  make the
eyebrows heavier, change the mouth, add bags under the eyes. When the
original and the altered copies are viewed side by side and upside down,
the changes can be very difficult to identify.  If these two pictures are
viewed upright, the differences are immediately apparent.  Another way to
illustrate visual attention is to make a pattern of identical marks or
simple objects, such as a sheet of paper with row upon row of X's, with
one row containing one or two Z's.  See how long it takes to identify the
odd letters or objects.  Students can devise tests like these in the
experimental part of this unit.<P>

PLANNING AND TEACHING
LAB ACTIVITIES</a> </h2></td></tr><tr><TD bgcolor="#ffffcc">

<font size="+1"><strong><I>Provide background 
information</i></strong></font><P>

First, prepare students for lab activities by giving background
information according to your teaching practices (e.g., lecture,
discussion, handouts, models).  Because students have no way of
discovering sensory receptors or nerve pathways for themselves, they need
some basic anatomical and physiological information.  Teachers may choose
the degree of detail and the methods of presenting the visual system,
based on grade level and time available. <P>

<font size="+1"><strong><I>Offer students the chance to create their own
experiments</I></strong></font><p>
Although students need direction and practice in order to become good (and
responsible) laboratory scientists, they also need to learn how to ask and
investigate questions they generate themselves.  Science classrooms that
offer only guided activities with a single "right" answer do not help
students learn to formulate questions, think critically, and solve
problems.  Because students are naturally curious, incorporating student
investigations into the classroom is a logical step after they have some
<P>experience with a system. 

The "Try Your Own Experiment" section of this unit (see the accompanying
Teacher and Student Guides) offers students an opportunity to direct some
of their own learning after a control system has been established in the
"Class Experiment." Because students are personally involved in this type
of experience, they tend to remember both the science processes and
concepts from these laboratories. <P>

<font size="+1"><strong><I>Use "Explore Time" before
experimenting</I></strong></font><p>

To encourage student participation in planning and conducting experiments,
first provide Explore Time or Brainstorming Time. Because of their
curiosity, students usually "play" with lab materials first even in a more
traditional lab, so taking advantage of this natural behavior is usually
successful. Explore Time can occur either before the Class Experiment or
before the "Try Your Own Experiment" activity, depending on the nature of
the concepts under study.<P>

<img src = "clear.gif" width="40"><font size="+1"><strong><I>Explore
before the Class Experiment</I></strong></font><p>

To use Explore Time before the Class Experiment, set the lab supplies out
on a bench before giving instructions for the experiment. Ask the students
how these materials, along with the information they have from the lecture
and discussion, could be used to investigate how we perceive depth.  Give
some basic safety precautions, then offer about 10 minutes for
investigating the materials. Circulate among students to answer questions
and encourage questions. After students gain an interest in the materials
and subject, lead the class into the Class Experiment with the Teacher
Demonstration and help them to formulate the Lab Question. Wait until this
point to hand out the Student Guide and worksheets, so students have a
chance to think creatively. (See the accompanying Guides.)<P>

<img src = "clear.gif" width="40"><font size="+1"><strong><I>Explore
before "Try Your Own Experiment"</I></strong></font><p>

To use Explore Time before Try Your Own Experiment, follow the procedure
above, adding the new materials for student-generated experiments.  Let
the students suggest a variety of ideas, then channel their energies to
make the lab manageable.  For example, when a number of groups come up
with similar ideas, help them formulate one lab question so that the
groups can compare data.  The goal is to encourage students to think and
plan independently while providing sufficient limits to keep the classroom
focused. The Teacher and Student Guides contain detailed suggestions for
conducting good student-generated experiments.

By reaching Project 2061 Benchmarks for Science Literacy, students will
also fulfill many of the National Science Education Standards and
individual state standards for understanding the content and applying the
methods of science.  Because the Benchmarks most clearly state what is
expected of students, they are used here.  
The Benchmarks are now on-line at: <a href =
"http://www.project2061.org/tools/benchol/bolframe.htm">
http://www.project2061.org/tools/benchol/bolframe.htm</a><p>

The Benchmarks are listed by chapter, grade level, and item number; for
instance, 1A, 6-8, #1 indicates Chapter 1, section A, grades 6-8,
benchmark 1.<p>

The PROCESS OF INQUIRY used in the Eye and its Connections activities will
help students reach the following summarized Benchmarks:
<p>
1A, 6-8, #1 <br>
When similar investigations give different results, the scientific
challenge is to judge whether the differences are trivial or significant,
and it often takes further studies to decide. 
<p>     
1B, 6-8, #1<BR> 
Scientific investigations usually involve the collection of relevant
evidence, the use of logical reasoning, and the application of imagination
in devising hypotheses and explanations to make sense of the collected
evidence.<p>     

1B, 6-8, #2 <BR>
If more than one variable changes at the same time in an experiment, the
outcome of the experiment may not be clearly attributable to any one of
the variables.<p>     

12A, 6-8, #2<BR>
Know that hypotheses are valuable, even if they turn out not to be true.
<p>     
12A, 6-8, #3<BR>
Know that often, different explanations can be given for the same
evidence, and it is not always possible to tell which one is correct. <p>     

12C, 3-5, #3<BR>
Keep a notebook that describes observations made, carefully distinguishes
actual observations from ideas and speculations about what was observed,
and is understandable weeks or months later.<p>     

The NEUROSCIENCE CONTENT in the Eye and its Connections activities and
Background material will help to meet the following Benchmarks:
<p>     
5C, 6-8, #1<BR> 
All living things are composed of cells. Different body tissues and organs
are made up of different kinds of cells.  The cells in similar tissues and 
organs in other animals are similar to those in human beings. <p>     

6A, 6-8, #1<BR>
Like other animals, human beings have body systems for the coordination of
body functions. <p>     

6C, 6-8, #1<BR>
Organs and organ systems are composed of cells and help to provide all
cells with basic needs.<p>     

6C, 6-8 #6 <BR>
Interactions among the senses, nerves, and brain make possible the
learning that enables human beings to cope with changes in their
environment.<p>       

6C, 9-12, #2<br>
The nervous system works by electrochemical signals in the nerves and from
one nerve to the next.<p>     

6D, 3-5, #2 <BR>
Human beings can use the memory of their past experiences to make
judgments about new situations.   <p>     

6D, 6-8, #3<br>     
 Human beings can detect a tremendous range of visual and olfactory
stimuli. <p>     

6D, 9-12, #3 <BR>

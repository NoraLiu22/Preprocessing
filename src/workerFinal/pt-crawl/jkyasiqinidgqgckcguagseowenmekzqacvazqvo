<h3>
<a name="Heading7"></a><b>I	REFLECTIONS ON ELECTIONS: THEIR ROLES, QUALITIES AND
REGULATION</b></h3>
<p>Elections are commonplace events. Both in terms of their frequency, but also
in the way they are taken for granted. Especially in
Australia, but more
generally in western democracies, their ebb and flow forms a seasonal rhythm,
against which the more substantive
work of government and public affairs &#8212;
policy debates, law-making, administration and the (re)construction of community
and
national identities &#8212; is played out, through debate in the media,
opinion polling and parliamentary and executive activity.</p>
<p>The magic long ago seeped out of our understanding and, for many, the
experience of elections. They are major logistical events,
certainly.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup> But on the surface they
appear to be relatively routine affairs, professionally run by full-time,
non-partisan electoral commissions,
who are bureaucratically guided, indeed
bound, by enormously detailed legislative codes. The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cea1918233/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Electoral
Act 1918</a></i> (Cth) (<i>CEA</i>), for example, currently extends to more than 350
pages. By contrast, the inaugural <i>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902</i> (Cth)
and accompanying <i>Commonwealth</i> <i>Franchise Act 1902</i> (Cth) together
spanned fewer than 45 pages. This eight-fold increase in legislative volume does
not reflect a burgeoning in the number
of elements to be regulated (the number
of sections has less than doubled).<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup>
The basic pattern and framework of 'free and fair' elections was settled more
than a century ago. Rather, the increase has occurred
in the detailed
prescriptiveness, the 'administrivia' even, of the law. As a leading electoral
administrator notes of the <i>CEA</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
It is &#8230; to a very great extent, procedurally oriented: terms expressing
overarching ideals, such as 'free and fair elections'
and 'the will of the
people' are singularly absent from it. The Act has no preamble. Eschewing
endorsement of broad principles, it
operates by prescribing systems,
institutions and actions &#8230; It is replete with pedantic detail, specifying,
for example, that
each voting compartment is to be furnished with a pencil for
the use of the voters (s 206)
&#8230;<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Elections,
then, are events at the cusp of the thin divide between politics and public law
and governance. But they are events &#8212;
processes &#8212; whose every
manifestation is either set or occurs within a framework set, usually in
considerable detail, by law.</p>
<p>But what are elections, and hence electoral law, <i>for</i>? The pragmatic
account, reflected in constitutional law texts and political science courses and
primers alike, is that they serve
two simple needs, one primary and one
subordinate. The primary aim is to populate Parliaments. The subordinate aim is
to do so democratically,
that is for the governed to choose representatives to
govern them. Elections are liminal events: they mark the transition of one
government to another, the bloodless passage of legitimate &#8212; or rather,
legitimised &#8212; power. Indirectly of course, they
serve other functions, of
a constitutive and democratic kind. They help define the political community:
for example, non-citizens
in Australia are excluded from the
franchise.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup> And they infuse
government with an element of accountability, at least to the extent that
regular elections and the fear of de-legitimation
at the polls can do so.</p>
<p>We could label this list an 'instrumental' account of the purposes of
elections. Cynicism about the point of voting, the quality of
parliamentary
representation, or the excessive power wielded by executive governments
notwithstanding, it is an impressive array
of purposes. For several generations
it has been sufficient to sustain a significant body of academic and political
inquiry, both
normative and empirical, about how well electoral rules serve
these purposes and how they fit into more fundamental postulates about
democracy
and constitutionalism. To wish to broaden the account might seem churlish, if
not downright dangerous.</p>
<p>But the instrumental account is only a partial and hence unsatisfying account
of elections. It is distinctly formalistic in tone,
and rationalist in its
inherent assumptions. As psychologists and others have long reminded us, the
human element in electoral processes
is the most compelling. Hence, behavioural
accounts of elections dominate the social science literature. And, of particular
interest
to legal scholars, the 'expressive' and indeed symbolic functions of
elections, both voting and campaigning, have been
chronicled.<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup> My vote may be worth
next to nothing in a mass electorate, but it <i>represents</i> something of
great, if not talismanic, value. It is my
'say'.<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup> The role of elections is
therefore not exhausted by the instrumental account.</p>
<p>Psychological or symbolic accounts of elections however, whilst offering
voter-centred insights into the role of elections, as well
as new research
agendas and predictive power otherwise occluded by the instrumental account of
elections, do not exhaust the terrain
of understanding. In their orientation on
the participant, they do, however, suggest a new set of perspectives from which
we can
come to understand elections, and hence electoral law. And by
'understand' I mean not just a textbook account of the formal or institutional
role of elections, but an appreciation of elections as important occasions
within the life of a society, with peculiar processes
and qualities formalised
by law.</p>
<p>Writing about electoral law as a discipline, Pamela Karlan reminds us, '[t]he
great thing about the law of the political process &#8230;
is the opportunities
it offers for building bridges. Some of those bridges are interdisciplinary
&#8230; .'<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup> The aim of this essay is
to explore two related perspectives from what might be labelled a social or
anthropological understanding
of elections. These are the ritual, and the
aesthetic.</p>
<p>The essay outlines what is involved in an understanding based on ritual and
aesthetics. To readers steeped in instrumental, normative
or empirical thinking
about politics and law, this may seem like a leap into the dark. So the essay
begins with some theoretical
background, contrasting the standard approaches and
arguing for a space in which the ritual and aesthetic can be recognised. After
that come case studies of the ritual and aesthetic in two key aspects of
electoral law and practice: voting and the place of money
in elections. We
cannot fully grasp what the legal forms underlying balloting are about without
exploring the ritual aspects of the
voting system. Similarly we cannot make
sense of the worldwide interest, bordering on obsession, with regulating
campaign finance,
without appreciating the aesthetic element to the aversion to
money in politics.</p>
<p>The reader should bear in mind that I am not claiming that the ritual and the
aesthetic ought be the guiding light in legal development.
Rather, my hope is to
demonstrate that the traditional perspectives are incomplete (if not at times
enervating). Attention to the
ritual and aesthetic dimensions of the structure
of elections can enrich our <i>descriptive</i> understanding of their complex,
legalistic process. We need to heed the role these elements play, usually
unacknowledged, in the
shape and experience of law.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading26"></a><b>II	THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON PUBLIC LAW: WHY HEED
THE RITUAL AND AESTHETIC ALONGSIDE THE NORMATIVE AND INSTRUMENTAL </b></h3>
<p>Theorising about politics, constitutional arrangements and especially
elections, has tended to be defined by a mixture of normative
reasoning, ie
appeals to political morality, and instrumentalist or functionalist thinking.
Undoubtedly, there is a dynamic relationship
between the two, an inter-linking
of normative and instrumental. Moral ends are sometimes buttressed by their
connection to some
practical function, and conversely, a particular practice is
often defended for its ability to advance a moral aim. </p>
<p>But there is more to thinking about the law of politics than the normative
and the instrumental. (Indeed, there is more to the normative
than the moral.) I
wish to draw attention to what, for want of better terms, I will define as the
aesthetic and ritual dimensions
of electoral law and practice. First, let me
introduce some terminology and map out the theoretical terrain.</p>
<p>Writing from a political science perspective, Daryl Glaser cites Isaiah
Berlin as defining normative political thinking as 'the discovery,
or
application, of moral notions in the sphere of political
relations'.<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup> Glaser himself prefers
a broader conception of normative theory as covering 'all political theorising
of a prescriptive or recommendatory
kind &#8230; what "ought to be", as opposed
to "what is"'.<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup> But this broader
notion may make more sense in political science, where a dichotomy between a
social science description of political
practice, and normative ideals, is
easier to draw. Such a strict division makes less sense in the domain of law,
given that law is
inescapably about prescribing behaviour. Normative theory
defined as broadly as 'what ought to be' collapses into tautology when
law
<i>necessarily</i> involves setting norms as ideals of behaviour. Berlin's
narrower conception thus makes more sense in the legal field. It draws attention
to the role of moralising (understood non-pejoratively) as a foundation for
public law, in contrast to resting constitutionalism
on say pragmatic,
historical, utilitarian, economic or psychological grounds.</p>
<p>Normativism in constitutional law generally, but electoral law in particular,
tends to encompass a set of liberal ideals, often presented
as self-evident
principles: democracy, accountability, equal liberties. These are sometimes
justified deontologically, usually in
a metaphysic grounded in individualism.
But such principles are equally defended by instrumentalist arguments. Take, for
example,
one-vote, one-value. Attempts have been made to root it in notions of
inherent rights &#8212;  'birthrights' even &#8212; such as
the right to equal
respect. But, just as fervently, supporters of one-vote, one-value give
consequentialist reasons in its favour.
Thus, we hear, equal voting rights
ensure the long-term stability of a political system, as well as more efficient
government, by
promoting accountability of the rulers to the ruled. </p>
<p>Of course such claims are not easily tested by empirical means, if at all. In
fact, at times the tenets of liberal democracy collapse
into nostrums or
'motherhood' claims. There is nothing untoward in that: any system must have
axiomatic bases. But it does mean that
at some point analysis gives way to
faith, or at the least acceptance of such principles as 'givens'.</p>
<p>Elections are not abstractions. They are events; that is how we experience
them, whether first hand or through the media. They are
not natural events of
course, but are complex administrative processes. Discussion of administration,
including administrative law,
tends to focus on technologies; techniques of
managing information and power. This fits with a prevailing, bureaucratic
perspective
on their study. So too when we come down from the rarefied axioms of
democratic theory and constitutional law to seek out the concrete
in elections
and electoral law, there is a tendency to focus on the 'nuts and bolts' of the
electoral machinery. Our gaze switches
from the 'god's eye view' to the
mechanic's.</p>
<p>But the task of describing public life and the law constituting it need not
be so dourly technocratic. We need a language that is
no less descriptive, but
is better able to capture the experience and meaning of elections. An analogy
may help here. In making sense
of our daily interactions with something as
fundamental to modern life as the motor vehicle, we have little use for theories
of transportation
or descriptions of Newton's laws. Although both are essential
to someone designing a new car, or reconceiving the city, they are
the god's eye
view. Nor, unless the car is in a pathological state, do we need the
technocratic perspective of the mechanic. What
we need to make sense of the
everyday is a different language, capable of describing the experience of the
car to us: how it feels
on the road, our sense of its form, its role and meaning
in our lives. And this is where the ritual and the aesthetic come into play.</p>
<p>To borrow from Henry Tudor's work <i>Political Myth</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
Philosophy and science explain things, not by telling the story of how they came
about, but by subsuming them under general laws
and principles &#8230; A
mythical explanation does nothing of the kind. The understanding it provides is
a practical understanding;
that is to say, an understanding in which men
consider the world that confronts them, <i>not as the object of disinterested
curiosity, but as the material for their
activity</i>.<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>I
do not wish to talk about myth as such (although doubtless there are many
stories underlying and infusing electoral politics and
law). But Tudor's
distinction is relevant to any attempt to understand social and legal processes
through the ritual and the aesthetic.
He reminds us we are searching for neither
an abstract theory nor a detached scientific standpoint because, for all their
power,
these represent <i>disinterested</i> perspectives. The ritual and
aesthetic, by contrast, capture <i>lived</i> perspectives <i>inherent</i> in
practices formularised by law.</p>
<p>These fresh perspectives will not supplant the old. We will continue to need
the abstractions and grand narratives of constitutional
theory and history, as
well as insights from instrumental theories, such as public choice theory,
particularly in times of challenge
to established assumptions. And we will
continue to need the technocratic &#8212; the black letter and doctrinal
approach &#8212;
particularly when knitting repairs or extensions to the fabric
of electoral law. But neither approach covers the field, and neither
captures
the full meaning of elections. So without dismissing or devaluing these
perspectives we need to put them in their place
and invite attention to the role
of electoral rules and processes in everyday life. </p>
<p>Any appeal to the idea of ritual brings to mind the anthropological approach,
especially the work of Victor
Turner.<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a></sup> Turner adopted a
suggestive quote from Monica Wilson's work on tribal religion:</p>
<blockquote>
rituals reveal values at the deepest level &#8230; men express in ritual what
moves them most, and since the form of expression is
conventionalised and
obligatory, it is the values of the group which are revealed. I see in the study
of rituals the key to an understanding
of the essential constitution of human
societies.<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Anthropologists
however rarely focus on industrialised societies. They prefer to attend to less
'developed' societies, whether existing
or historical. (Of course often they
then draw insights from such societies for an understanding of contemporary
western society
&#8212; one desire of anthropology is to find universalisable
lessons in the study of humankind.) Further, anthropological studies
of the
ritual &#8212; and symbolic &#8212; aspects of social life tend to cluster
around obvious areas like religious practice. Sometimes
they venture into legal
and conflict-solving processes.<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup>
But rarely have they given sustained attention to the political domain.</p>
<p>Sociologists, in contrast, have been more attentive to the ritual in public
and social practices in the
west.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup> An obviously rich field to
explore the customary and legal responses to quotidian life has been the way we
handle mortality &#8212;
 not just funeral rites, but the laws and social
reflexes that are triggered by
death<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup> &#8212; and court
processes.<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup> But whilst human
mortality and the setting of legal judgment have provided the most obvious sites
for appreciating the broader meaning
of collective practices, they are only the
tip of the iceberg. </p>
<p>In Murray Edelman's influential work, <i>The Symbolic Uses of Politics</i>,
ritual is described as any 'motor activity that involves its participants
symbolically in a common enterprise, calling their attention
to their
relatedness and joint interests in a compelling
way.'<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup> Elections of course are
not rituals in the pure or narrow sense, where ritual is disconnected from
'technological routine'.<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup>
Elections as we noted have an inescapably pragmatic function: they offer a
bloodless solution to the challenges of legitimating,
and enabling the
transition between, political
regimes.<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup> They are a rational way
of managing claims to governmental power.</p>
<p>But Edelman's insight was to challenge popular rationalist explanations of
politics; explanations that often look neat on the page,
but are neither born
out by empirical evidence nor blessed with predictive power. In their stead, he
drew attention to the symbolic
significance of political structures, processes
and actions. Elections, including individual voter behaviour, he argued, are
rarely
occasions for a rational weighing of issues. They tend, rather, to
embrace a more varied (but no less significant) set of functions,
in which the
rationalist account was important primarily as a <i>myth</i>, a precondition of
faith, rather than as the goal of the process:</p>
<blockquote>
[Elections] give people a chance to express discontents and enthusiasms, to
enjoy a sense of involvement. This is participation in
a ritual act, however;
only in a minor degree is it participation in policy formation. Like all ritual
&#8230;. elections draw attention
to common social ties and to the importance
and apparent reasonableness of accepting the public policies that are adopted
&#8230;
The key point is, however, that elections could not serve this vital
social function if the common belief in direct popular control
over governmental
policy through elections were to be widely
questioned.<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
discussing ritual and aesthetics, however, I prefer to avoid the language of
symbolism, for two reasons. Elections are anything
but symbols, in the ordinary
meaning of that term, that is, condensed references or suggestive devices acting
as metaphors to a larger
body of meaning. Also, I do not want to create
confusion with political symbols &#8212; which are of course important elements
in
electoral practice, especially campaigning &#8212; or confusion with
political scholarship on 'symbolic
action'.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>It might be wondered why legal thought should concern itself with matters
such as ritual at a time in western history when organised
religion and, some
say, civic society in general, are in retreat and the market economy in the
ascendant. Are these not conditions
in which any search for social meaning
becomes an unprofitable scrounging for scraps? When the real feast of
understanding lies in
applying law and economics to make sense of a public
sphere in a secular modernity that is being transformed by corporatisation and
privatisation, atomisation and individualisation?</p>
<p>Secular modernity itself, however, no less than any other abstract ideal of
government and social life, rests on its own founding
myths. The state, and
politics in particular, may in fact be in the process of being 're-sacralized'.
It is not hard to find evidence
of nationalisms, new and old, conflating the
instinct to civic pride and specific forms of democracy into a 'civil
religion'.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p> The most obvious contemporary example of these tendencies is the renewed
commitment to ceremonies honouring the military and military
traditions. Whilst
governments are deliberately fostering these, to reinforce policies of
remilitarisation, the trend predates recent
fretting about national security:
interest in Anzac Day, for example, has grown for more than a decade. </p>
<p>No less obvious, and certainly no less ceremonial are sporting events. It may
seem trite to say that sport forms a kind of secular
religion in Australia; the
point to note is that sport's professionalisation has not led to it withering
into a site for mere consumption.
One needs more than an understanding of
contract law to appreciate the important role sport now plays in public affairs.
That role
is made blatant by the attachment of political figures to major
sporting events, by governmental funding and interest in 'sport policy'.
These
very public developments in an otherwise 'secular' state can only be understood
in the context of the ritual and aesthetic
experience generated by militarism
and sport in our public life.</p>
<p>'Aesthetics' has cropped up in contemporary legal theorising so frequently as
to have become a buzzword. In the chronology of jurisprudence,
this may come as
no surprise. The coupling of law and humanities flowered into the law and
literature movement. Interdisciplinary
musings on the 'textuality' of law and
congruence between law and literature then led to the invoking of literary
aesthetics to shed
light on legal
rhetoric.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup> The next obvious stop
was the intersection of law and art, or law and
music.<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Explorations of the aesthetics of law however eschew any necessary connection
between law and the beautiful. They reject any Hegelian
link between 'the
aesthetic' and the fine arts, for instance. Pierre Schlag's already influential
'The Aesthetics of American Law'
is built on this disavowal: 'There will be no
idealization of aesthetics and no romanticisation of
law.'<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup> Adam Gearey, similarly,
takes Ernest Weinrib to task for the sin of formalism: of finding beauty in an
(imagined) internal coherence
of
law.<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup> From the outset, then, we
need to be aware of a danger in thinking of aesthetics in law as only a concern
with form, lest it dissolve
like formalism into a sterile, closed model.</p>
<p>What then is a non-formalist 'aesthetic' perspective on law? Mark Parker
offers the following: 'we use aesthetic language to express
our emotional
reactions to qualities that belong purely to the structure and/or composition of
[an] object or situation.'<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup> He
argues that the acknowledgment 'that <i>value can inhere in actions
themselves</i> is what defines the primary difference between the aesthetic view
and [either consequentialist reasoning or
moralising]'.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup> Parker's
definition is a useful working definition, provided the term 'emotional' is not
misread. 'Affective' and 'sensory' may better
capture the aesthetic response, as
in Schlag's account:</p>
<blockquote>
My use of the term ['aesthetics'] draws on its Greek etymology
(<i>aisthetikos</i>), meaning perception or sensation. In this conception, the
aesthetic pertains to the forms, images, tropes, perceptions, and sensibilities
that help shape the creation, apprehension, and even identity of human
endeavours, including &#8230;
law.<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Some aspects
of law naturally cry out for aesthetic readings, most obviously law concerning
the body and carnality, especially sumptuary
law (laws about excess or
fashion)<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup> and obscenity
laws.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></sup> The thrust of aesthetic
approaches in legal philosophy however has been to generate new meta-theories of
law: law as aesthetics,
and the aesthetics of law, where law is understood as an
abstract whole. My project here is much humbler and more concrete. It is
an
exercise in what William Twining would call 'middle order
theorising'.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p> It is an attempt to better understand a particular field of legal regulation
&#8212; in this case electoral law &#8212; by stepping
back from the familiar,
even stale, perspective of normative and instrumentalist thinking, and finding a
fresh gaze. What follows
applies ritual and aesthetic perspectives to two
cornerstone aspects of elections and their regulation; the voting process and
campaign
finance.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading81"></a><b>III	RITUAL AND AESTHETIC DIMENSIONS TO ELECTORAL LAW:
STUDIES OF VOTING AND MONEY POLITICS</b><br><a name="Heading82"></a><b>A	The
ritual of the voting experience</b></h3>
<p>In Australia the chief features of voting, enshrined in electoral laws of
varying degrees of controversy, are: (a) the compulsion
to enrol and vote; (b)
the secret ballot; and (c) the paper ballot and its public count. That voting
itself has a ritual dimension,
which varies according to how that process is
formularised by legal regulation, should come as no surprise. It may seem odd to
also
claim that balloting has an aesthetic dimension, if voting is seen as
purely a bureaucratic process, an exercise in form-filling.
But it does.</p>
<p>Consider first the contrast between modern voting practices and their
19<sup>th</sup> century forbears. We tend to forget that something as obvious as
a paper form listing options for selection &#8212; that is, the
ballot &#8212;
had to be invented. Its refinement into a <i>secret</i> ballot, given great
impetus and its first widespread adoption in Australia, was indeed a
revolution.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a></sup> Prior to the ballot,
voting was by open polling. As the derivation of the word 'poll' (that is,
'head') suggests, polling was a purely
physical act, of identifying support for
a person or proposition with one's body (for example, with raised hand or
voice). Polling
in elections prior to the ballot invariably involved a public
declaration for the candidate of choice, with that choice being simultaneously
recorded in an official polling book. </p>
<p>Open polling presents functional benefits and impediments. Electors can make
a show of their emphatic (or otherwise) support for a
candidate. Votes are
instantly recorded so that candidates and the wider public can witness trends
over the course of polling. Provided
there is close scrutiny, the system is not
just reliable, but seen to be so: although, since there is no undeniable record
of a vote,
errors, deliberate or otherwise, can creep in without any recourse to
a recount.</p>
<p>Open polling has a vastly different ritual and aesthetic element to secret
balloting. It is an inherently public action, and hence
polling itself attracted
crowds of onlookers. In the simplest scenario, polling would occur at the same
place as the hustings, that
is, at a public location, including a platform,
where candidates would declare themselves and address the crowd before polling
would
take place. Polling days were colourful occasions, like feast days, whose
social and communal aspects were plain. More sinisterly,
open polling lent
itself to the prevailing practices of bribery and
intimidation.<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a></sup> Not just because
the manner of an elector's vote was publicly known, but because the tendency to
draw crowds facilitated the offering
of incentives, treating and the making of
threats.</p>
<p>If we were to gaze too long at William Hogarth's renderings of open polling,
we would develop a perhaps unduly jaundiced view of
it.<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p> Yet we do not need history to experience the practice. Open polling is still
common, from trade union and club meetings, to committees
and boards of
directors, and most obviously, in Parliament itself. It is also a feature,
albeit indirectly, of some public elections.
For example, the influential Iowan
caucuses, which begin the 'primary' or pre-selection season in United States
(US) electoral law,
are conducted through open voting and debate.<sup>
<a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a></sup> Each of these settings stages
polling under slightly different rules, but the aspect of openness remains
common. We can argue about
how the dynamics of such polling affect the
psychology of decision-making in these settings, but such polling today rarely
presents
the chaos that afflicted parliamentary elections in centuries past,
most likely due to a renewed concern for conscience.</p>
<p>The value which proponents of open polling feared would be lost in the move
to the secret ballot was <i>courage</i>, or rather the courage of one's
convictions. At first this may seem paradoxical &#8212; open polling risked
insincere voting,<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a></sup> whether
through bribery or the fear of undue influence on those who were dependent on or
intimidated by others. But at the heart
of open polling is the virtue of
standing up for one's beliefs: or at least being willing to proclaim them to the
world. Opponents
of the secret ballot derided it as an 'unmanly'
thing.<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></sup> Some even claimed it was
'un-English' to want to do secretly what should be done fairly and
openly,<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a></sup> and drew parallels
between secrecy and metaphors of the hidden, the veiled feminine and the
shrouded Catholic. The attribution of
Catholic values to the secret ballot seems
odd in hindsight: today we think of Catholic societies as stressing the communal
whilst
associating Protestantism with treasuring the individual conscience, the
virtue at the heart of the secret ballot. Actually, the
attribution ought to
have sounded ironic even at the time: elections in 19<sup>th</sup> century Irish
seats were declared void, by English judges, on the grounds of 'spiritual undue
influence' by the Catholic clergy on
their
flock.<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a></sup> Such influence occurred,
of course, not in secret, but from the pulpit, a most public of places.</p>
<p>The religious connection to secret balloting, however, is far from misguided.
As Mark McKenna highlights, drawing on a poem by Les
Murray, the secret ballot
turned 'the polling booth [into] a closet of
prayer.'<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a></sup> To Murray, the secret
ballot, coupled with the universal franchise, offered hope to working people.
But even aside from its vital
function in democratic emancipation, the secret
ballot as a formal process established a unique ritual and aesthetic to voting,
which
we experience to this day. In the terms of the modern law:</p>
<blockquote>
(1) &#8230; the voter upon receipt of the ballot-paper shall without
delay:</blockquote><p>(a)	retire alone to some unoccupied compartment of the
booth, and there, in private, mark his or her vote &#8230;</p>
<p>(b)	fold the ballot-paper so as to conceal his or her vote and &#8230;</p>
<p>(c)	quit the booth.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>The language of 'retiring alone', 'compartment of the booth', and concealment
is telling: it is more King James than the legalese
we normally find in
technocratic legislation. The paper ballot, often described as a 'sacred
birthright', is received like a communion
wafer. The booth forms a confessional.
The act of voting is solemn but dignified. The vote may be a whisper, but it is
whispered
to the gods. And it is not linguistic association alone that suggests
these connections. These are not mere metaphors; they are part
of the ritual
embodied in the process mandated by law. Voting for parliamentary elections is
as secular and civic an activity as
can be imagined, but its form owes much to a
religious rite, far removed say from the process of shopping in a marketplace,
our other
common experience of making public choices. </p>
<p>This is not to say that every elector feels or needs to consciously reflect
on this ritual; but that the ritual element is unmistakeably
embedded in the
form of the process. Certainly some electors see voting as a chore, albeit a
necessary one. Many complain about the
need to run the gauntlet of partisan
activists who thrust 'how-to-vote' cards at them as they approach the polling
station. </p>
<p>The behaviour of electors running this gauntlet is fascinating. Everyone
involved is acting out a kind of political performance. Many,
unworried about
the waste of paper, take all the cards on offer. Whether they do so to invoke
the secrecy of the ballot, by avoiding
signalling their partisan preferences, or
out of courtesy, recognising the efforts of the party faithful, they are
channelling important
aspects of the spirit of polling day. Many others,
however, see 'how-to-vote' cards as a waste of trees, or are offended that party
activists sully the sacredness of the secrecy of the ballot by engaging in a
kind of solicitation best left to the shopping mall.
</p>
<p>There is a strand of regulatory history in Australia that sought to exclude
such canvassing, and that carries through to today in
the form of a six metre
buffer zone around the polling station
itself.<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[43]</a></sup> However whilst electoral
law does not mandate the provision of how-to-vote cards, in almost all
Australian jurisdictions it does
more than merely tolerate
them.<sup><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[44]</a></sup> This permissiveness may be
a matter of constitutional principle, given the implied freedom of political
communication doctrine. But
the repeated refusal of legislatures to pass laws
for the display of 'how-to-vote' cards in each polling compartment ensures that
their mass distribution remains an integral, last-minute form of campaigning at
the door-step of the polling
station.<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[45]</a></sup> Indeed the paper
ballot, without which voting systems more complex than the first-past-the-post
system would have been impossible,
itself led to the phenomenon of 'how-to-vote'
cards.</p>
<p>Earlier we commented on the public/private duality of voting under the secret
ballot. It is a private act in a public space, a public
gathering on a public
day. This is inherently the case with balloting everywhere in the world, given
the constitutive role that elections
play. But it is especially the case in
Australia given the legal compulsion to enrol and vote, on pain of a fine. </p>
<p>First instituted in 1911, compulsory enrolment has been described by
electoral historian Marian Sawer as a natural extension of the
pragmatic
professionalism of Australian electoral authorities. They prided themselves on
the completeness of their rolls.<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[46]</a></sup>
Compulsory voting, which followed initially in Queensland in 1915, then
federally in 1924, has been derided over the years as a pillowing
of the major
parties (who are saved the hassle of having to 'get out' the vote). Libertarians
have gone as far as to claim it taints
elections.<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[47]</a></sup> Conversely it has
been championed by egalitarians as a 'great leveller', a means of ensuring
marginalised voices are heard.<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[48]</a></sup>
But if we take off our instrumentalist glasses, we see that compulsion embodies
the idea that voting is not just an expressive right,
but also a communal duty.
In doing so, it clearly fits a particular aesthetic vision of an election as a
quintessential public event.
In law's dream, every citizen must
vote,<sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[49]</a></sup> for every citizen is
equal, their voice equally relevant, their obligations equal. Contrast this with
the fact that it is considered
unconstitutional for the Queen to vote at a
United Kingdom (UK) election. This curio can be explained in a technical
fashion, drawing
on the historically separate roles of the Crown in Parliament,
the Commons and the Lords (just as the nobility were not entitled
to stand for
the Commons). But it is best understood for the aesthetic it symbolises. The
Sovereign is literally above politics,
and not one of the people; indeed in
mimicry of that position and to avoid embarrassment to her, other members of her
family elect
not to vote as
well.<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<p>We should also reflect on <i>where</i> it is we are compelled to gather to
vote.<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[51]</a></sup> By long custom, the
electoral commissions designate schools and community halls (and to a lesser
extent church and town halls) as
polling
stations.<sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[52]</a></sup> It could be otherwise:
we could be summonsed to greyer sites such as the offices of government
departments, such as electoral offices.
</p>
<p>Or we could be summonsed to more colourful sites, such as hotels. Indeed the
inaugural Commonwealth Electoral Bill 1902 (Cth) proposed
banning the use of
licensed premises for election
purposes.<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[53]</a></sup> Not using licensed
premises for public purposes, whether it be candidate addresses or official
business such as polling, was obviously
a matter of decorum. But the House of
Representatives voted the prohibition down, objecting that in some rural
locations the pub
was the best, indeed the only, protected
area.<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[54]</a></sup> The <i>CEA</i>, curiously
enough, explicitly permits the Electoral Commissioner to use licensed premises
for polling, provided no alcohol is sold
in that part of the premises on polling
day.<sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[55]</a></sup> Between the pub and the
public school, the two most ubiquitous buildings in Australia, the school and
community hall is the chosen
site for polling. Why? Certainly the pub has faded
somewhat as the central gathering spot of Australian social life, but alcohol
remains as central as education or voluntary associations.</p>
<p>To ask the question is almost to answer it. The aesthetic element of drawing
people back to school, or gathering them in community
halls, to take part in the
ritual of voting is blatant.<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[56]</a></sup>
Schools remain central to the construction of civic identity, but also to the
liminal transition between childhood and adulthood.
It is no coincidence that
schooling finishes in the 17<sup>th</sup> year and the franchise begins at 18.
Just as schooling is compulsory, so too is voting. Returning to school to vote
reminds us of
the staged passage of life. Typically families vote together, at
least as nuclear families or children helping elderly parents to
vote.<sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p> Australian law has long facilitated this by mandating Saturday as polling
day.<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[58]</a></sup> In many other nations,
polling takes place on a
weekday,<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[59]</a></sup> a transaction to be
fitted around employment obligations for many, like popping into a store for
milk on the way home to or from
work. And then, when the elector leaves the
polling station, what confronts her? Invariably, an assortment of civic groups,
the scouts,
the Parents and Citizens group, all selling homemade produce. This
is more than an embellishment. National politics grows in a garden
of local
community.</p>
<p>The central public experience of elections is voting; but as polling day
fades into election night, all attention turns to the count
itself. Election
night is a significant aspect of the ritual of elections, as a matter of both
electoral law and tradition. This
is accentuated in Australia, by the reluctance
to move to mechanised or computerised voting, in contrast to the embracing of
electronic
voting by much larger democracies such as India, the United States
and Brazil. </p>
<p>The count on election night is not official, in the sense that the bundling
and tallying of votes that occurs in each polling station,
which is then fed
into the Electoral Commission's databases, is always subject to a formal
re-counting and checking at a centralised
location in each constituency, under
the eye of the Divisional Returning Officer. The election night count is not
simply for show:
it is explicitly required by
law.<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[60]</a></sup> But its mandating is not
just attributable to the thirst of both the public and politicians for an early
indication of results, for
it is ultimately a time-honoured part of the
<i>spectacle</i> of election night. </p>
<p>The unofficial count that occurs in polling stations nationwide is obviously
a public ritual in that it rests in the hands of tens
of thousands of casual
employees, most hired for the day, in a great gesture of trust and dispersal of
state power. It also provides
an avenue for participation for thousands of
humble party members, who gather inside polling stations when their doors are
locked
at 6pm, to scrutinise the count. Scrutineers occupy an important office,
designed to ensure the transparency of
elections.<sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[61]</a></sup> But whether they do
or not in fact, the status of being a scrutineer also offers several expressive
outlets. Scrutineers demonstrate
loyalty to their candidate and party by
discerning the trend in preferences and feeding this into party calculations
well before
the preference count is conducted. Scrutineering also provides a
ritual of public involvement: scrutineers feel themselves engaged
in an act of
citizenship. They are <i>witnesses</i> to the unfolding count. At law they may
not have a definitive power to decide a ballot's informality &#8212; their power
is limited
to objecting to muddled ballots and calling for an official
determination. But they serve as witnesses, for example, to the most
marginalised of expressive acts, the deliberate informal vote. Compelled to the
polls in spite of apathy, some electors scrawl 'Donald
Duck', 'Steve Waugh for
PM' or even obscenities on their ballots. Such conscious informality is not,
unfortunately, registered in
the official count, but lumped in with informality
caused by voter error or
ignorance.<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[62]</a></sup> Its witnessing, then,
is an important act.</p>
<p>The primary public space of election night is the tally room, or rather its
broadcast. In the words of political journalist Paul Lyneham:</p>
<blockquote>
[After the campaign] comes Grand Final Night: a great performance of Australian
political theatre that's often surprising, usually
fascinating and always
important.<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[63]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Naturally
journalists appreciate the aesthetic spectacle of election night. The tally room
and the live feeds into party gatherings,
give them and the political caste a
physical focus, a place to gather, a dramatic stage for the magnanimous claiming
of victory or
graceful concession of defeat. But this is not just theatre for
the sake of ratings or a nostalgic perpetuation of tradition. It
is an important
enactment of the transition of power. One does not have to be present in
Canberra to enjoy, celebrate or mourn the
event: it is broadcast in full and
live by two television networks,<sup><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[64]</a></sup>
into millions of homes and gatherings. Such occasions have even been captured in
artefacts such as David Williamson's <i>Don's
Party</i>.<sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>At first glance, the rituals of the tally room broadcast might seem to be
purely cultural practices, divorced from any legal framework.
But that is not
strictly true. As we noted, there is a growing push for computerised voting,
including from within the legal
academy.<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[66]</a></sup> Pragmatic concerns with
electronic security aside, computerised voting almost seems so inevitable that
the legislative clinging to
a system of pencils and paper ballots seems almost
Luddite. Regardless of any cost-benefit analysis, a shift from the tangible to
the electronic would involve a legal revolution &#8212; an overhauling of
electoral legislation including a legal re-conceptualisation
of electoral
security and integrity.<sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[67]</a></sup> But it
would not just be a black-letter revolution. The ritual and aesthetic experience
of polling would also change dramatically.
Unless there was a printed 'receipt'
of how every elector voted, some electors' sense of trust of the process might
be imperilled,
even if the system was objectively more trustworthy due to the
reduction of human error. Such receipts would in turn threaten the
accepted
understanding of ballot secrecy. With final counts, if not
results,<sup><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[68]</a></sup> knowable literally at
the touch of a button, the ritual of election night would be diminished or at
least transformed. </p>
<p>Even more radical would be internet voting, which is already common in
internal elections within organisations, such as for university
committees.
Internet voting would reflect hyper-capitalism: a society of individuals too
busy, or at least too enamoured of the experience
of consuming life on-line,
from home, to gather in public for public purposes. But the aesthetic
transformation would cut both ways.
'E-voting', as it is sometimes dubbed, may
come to be <i>expected</i> by coming generations, born to interact with the
world and each other via the keyboard. If that is the case, to cling on to paper
ballots and voting in queues in musty church or school halls will only serve to
signal the irrelevancy or the 'unsexiness' of elections.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading150"></a><b>B	Money in politics, and the aesthetic aversion to
it</b></h3>
<p>The role of money in modern elections is a perennial issue. Money is
reflexively assumed to be a potentially, if not actually, corrupting
factor,
whether its influence be <i>on</i> politicians &#8212; through wealthy interests
buying access or favours &#8212; or <i>in the hands of</i> politicians &#8212;
as in the crude bribery of electors in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup>
centuries. In either instance, the normative concept of 'corruption' that is
invoked concerns the ideals of public office and duty.
</p>
<p>No consensus has ever been reached on what factors ought prevail in the
deliberations of either politicians or voters. For instance,
should a politician
favour the policy that promotes his constituency's interests, that of the class
or ideology that elected him,
or some broader if nebulous national interest?
Similarly, should the elector consider only personal interests, favour a set of
ideological
commitments, or imagine a broader communal or even national
interest? Perhaps each is free to pursue any of these interests. Or perhaps
parliamentarians are free to abdicate their decision on policy measures either
to a party line or by 'log-rolling', that is,  trading
a vote on an issue to
which one attaches little interest, for support on an issue of greater interest.
But it is beyond doubt that
neither parliamentarians nor electors are legally,
let alone ethically, entitled to let payments to them influence their
decisions.</p>
<p>This norm seems so fundamental it could be elevated to a slogan: 'Elections
and elective democracy are not for sale.' As a normative
proposition, it is
synonymous with the liberal democratic ideal of a political meritocracy, marked
by equality of electoral opportunity.
And from a utilitarian standpoint, it has
a host of rationales. Chief amongst these is avoiding the distorting effects on
good governance
of corporations and lobbyists gouging 'rent' by buying policy
and legislative favours, or of wealthy individuals buying their way
into
parliamentary office.</p>
<p>Yet, put baldly in the 'not for sale' slogan, it is immediately obvious that
this norm is seriously circumscribed and often outflanked.
Votes cannot be
directly and individually purchased, but to 'buy' votes en masse through say
promises of tax cuts, is at worst considered
a form of 'metaphorical' electoral
bribery, and at best, is seen as the proper functioning of the democracy of the
hip-pocket.<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[69]</a></sup> And whilst political
favours and decisions may not be directly bought and sold, politics is happily
conceived of as the art of deal-making,
a set of transactions with consideration
sounding in everything <i>but</i> direct monetary exchange between the
deal-makers.</p>
<p>The claim I propose in this section is that our law embodies an aversion to
money in electoral politics in part on aesthetic grounds.
The term 'aesthetic'
here is linked closely to ideals of political propriety and virtue. The aversion
to money politics is thus explicable
not only through rationalist appeals to
meritocracy and public choice calculations of utility, or fears of corruption:
it also has
a distinctly aesthetic dimension.</p>
<p>In this aesthetic ideal, the right way for candidates and electors alike to
behave is to attend to ideas, words and images. These
are the proper 'currency'
of electoral politics, which is ideally carried out in a rhetorical domain.
Unlike so many other spheres
of modern life, its ideal form is not a marketplace
where money is the ultimate broker, or mediator, between desire and reality.
To
recognise this is not, it should be stressed, to neuter elections as robust
competitions. To draw on well-worn metaphors, elections
can still be played out
in anything from a battleground of clashing policy ideas, to a charismatic
'beauty contest'. </p>
<p>Nor does the aversion to money amount to repulsion; it is not absolutist.
Money cannot be expunged from elections. That would be impossible
on several
levels. Its ubiquity and fluidity make it hard to control in elections, as
captured in Dan Lowenstein's jocular truism,
'the root of all evil is deeply
rooted',<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[70]</a></sup> and Samuel Issacharoff
and Pamela Karlan's metaphor of the 'hydraulics' of campaign
finance.<sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[71]</a></sup> Money is a
<i>necessary</i> evil because of its utility and
fungibility.<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[72]</a></sup> The law seeks,
rather, to reduce money to a subsidiary role. It remains important to help
secure media time, so that images or ideas
can be efficiently beamed to a mass
electorate, or to hire polling expertise, so that popular opinion can be fed
into policy-making.
Further, parties and political movements have to be financed
<i>somehow</i>. For without healthy parties and lobby groups, ideas do not
become translated into coherent policies or promulgated widely through
political
debate and discourse.</p>
<p>Nor is the aversion to money in politics universal, in the sense that it is
not uniform across history or culture. Eighteenth century
elections to
Westminster Parliament were ruled by monetary transactions, for
example.<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[73]</a></sup> It took a legal purge,
marshalling a new breed of election judges and tightened criminal laws, reform
of the franchise, campaigning
and polling practices, and a reinvention of
political ethics, to bring about a transformation. The purge went so far, for
example,
that in 1854, it was made an illegal practice to provide to:</p>
<blockquote>
any Person having a Vote &#8230; or to &#8230; any inhabitant [of a
constituency] any Cockade, Ribbon or other Mark of
Distinction.<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[74]</a></sup></blockquote><p>This
rule was tightened in a further prohibition in 1883:</p>
<blockquote>
No payment or contract &#8230; shall, for the purpose of &#8230; the election of
a candidate at any election, be made [for] bands
of music, torches, flags,
banners, cockades, ribbons, or other marks of
distinction.<sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[75]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Breaches
of these laws, involving the candidate or his agent, were not just punishable by
stiff fines (a maximum of &#163;100 for
the 1883 prohibition) but could also
void the candidate's election.<sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[76]</a></sup>
Such measures were 'sold' as part of a crackdown on the cost of elections. But
equally they were sumptuary laws &#8212; laws about
fashion, laws against
excess.<sup><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[77]</a></sup> As such, they served
also to drain colour from elections and to re-route campaign practices through a
puritanical electoral aesthetic.
These rules applied in the UK until well into
the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<sup><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[78]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>We find more than an echo of such an aesthetic in contemporary law reform.
The most obvious is the priggish ban on 'inappropriate'
candidate and party
names, including 'frivolous' names (even if the person concerned is well-known
by that name, such as Tamara Tonite,
a drag-queen and community television
celebrity.)<sup><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[79]</a></sup> Despite a
parliamentary committee recommendation to liberalise this law, the federal
government is committed to blanching such small
strokes of colour from election
campaigns.<sup><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>A more substantial example of a puritanical aesthetic at work in recent
electoral law is the celebrated, but short-lived attempt by
the Hawke government
to ban paid broadcast advertising from Australian elections. It was inspired by
the long-standing British model,
in which television advertising of any
political cause is suspect and in their stead 'talking head' party political
broadcasts are
allocated free air-time. But the Australian ban was struck down
by the High Court.<sup><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>A parliamentary committee advocated the ban, ostensibly to rein in the cost
of electioneering and indirectly, thereby, minimise the
risk of
corruption.<sup><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[82]</a></sup> Politically, it was
an attempt by the Australian Labor Party (ALP), traditionally less able to raise
large donations than the conservative
parties, to equalise the playing field by
negating the influence of the market in political donations. Curiously, the High
Court
invoked free speech ideals in invalidating the ban. The British campaign
aesthetic, which the Hawke reforms sought to import into
Australia, is not
anti-free speech; it merely favours a more intellectual, if dour approach to
campaigning by prohibiting the 30
second, image conscious medium of the
television commercial. The High Court decision however, imported into the
<i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> a more Americanised idea of the free market in
electoral competition. The unspoken aesthetic of this is the acceptance of
aspects
of American campaigning for good (clever television ads may keep
politics 'sexy') and for ill (for example, the unedifying phenomenon
of 'attack'
ads).</p>
<p>The aversion to money in politics thus translates differently as we move
between electoral systems, even in the common law world.
The question of money
in politics is perhaps of greatest concern in the United
States,<sup><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[83]</a></sup> where civic culture in
general and electioneering in particular, is somewhat brasher than in Australia,
and where a laissez-faire
approach to the market has a longer and deeper
history. In legal terms, this is normally attributed to the strength of first
amendment
doctrine, which '"has its fullest and most urgent application" to
speech uttered during a campaign for political
office.'<sup><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[84]</a></sup> This doctrine
explicitly draws a metaphorical link between commerce and politics:</p>
<blockquote>
It is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an <i>uninhibited
marketplace</i> of ideas in which truth will ultimately
prevail&#8230;<sup><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[85]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>In this vision, politics, especially electoral politics, is not,
of course, simply reduced to a sub-species of commercial behaviour.
The appeal
to an ultimate 'truth', as a teleological by-product of the 'marketplace of
ideas', is something of a furphy. It is certainly
not to be equated with the
common (and infinitely more testable) claim that the marketplace of commerce
produces greater wealth.
Rather than 'truth', the marketplace metaphor is more
sincerely concerned to protect values such as individual liberty of expression
and conscience, and the flourishing of diverse and novel opinions.</p>
<p>A striking feature of the marketplace of ideas metaphor is that it tends to
flow only one way. Public life draws on market metaphors,
but commercial life is
rarely conceived of in concepts drawn from public law. Karlan explained in her
pluralistic account, 'Politics
by Other Means':</p>
<blockquote>
We hold both market and nonmarket understandings about what politics is about
simultaneously. We are both drawn toward and resistant
to understanding politics
as simply another form of
market.<sup><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[86]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Yet even
(or perhaps especially) in theorising about electoral law in the US, the
marketplace metaphor dominates. The latest example
is Samuel Issacharoff and
Richard Pildes' influential work 'Politics as Markets', which has spawned a vein
of scholarship concerned
not with balancing rights, but ensuring electoral
competition and avoiding the 'locking-up' of politics by incumbents manipulating
electoral rules.<sup><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[87]</a></sup> The US Supreme
Court thus sometimes refers back to a key driver of the debate at the turn of
the 20<sup>th</sup> century, namely a Willy Loman-like concern with the
interests of the 'little fellow' in the face of the distorting effects of big
money on public policy. But it does so relatively rarely, and more for
rhetorical rather than constitutional effect. Unsurprisingly,
then, despite the
best efforts of some academic
voices,<sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[88]</a></sup> the influence of
liberal, market-oriented thinking tends to drown out appeals in US political and
legal discourse to deeper ideals
such as political equality.</p>
<p>Could it be otherwise? Money is a <i>sine qua non</i> of US elections, more
than perhaps any other democracy, since electoral politics is commercialised in
the US more than elsewhere.
By 'commercialised' I do not just mean the obvious
manifestations of commerce, such as the importance of political marketing
through
polling, communication strategies and so on, or the way elections have
become a business, reliant on an industry of political consultants
hired to
manage campaigns, but who are not necessarily aligned with any particular
political ideology.<sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[89]</a></sup> Such
commercialisation is relatively superficial. Deeper lies an inextricably
interwoven ideology of freedom and economy, which generates
a peculiar but
seductive idea of democracy: seductive that is for any society inclined to see
itself as a pluralistic agglomerations
of individuals. A founding myth of this
form of individualism is that desires and interests come before &#8212; and to
&#8212; the
marketplace of commerce and ideas. These marketplaces are taken,
therefore, to exist merely to tally and satisfy these desires and
interests, not
to create or reconstruct them in any form of social consensus, let alone an
ideal society.<sup><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[90]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It might naively be assumed that capitalism in the US would lead to
depoliticisation, to a tuning out from public affairs by a populace
lulled by
the nirvana of consumerism. The contrary appears to be truer: everything public
is thoroughly politicised in the US. It
is true of the law &#8212; witness the
irreconcilable clashes of 'rights' claims that are invoked in all manner of
social issues,
or the politicised processes of judicial appointment and even
election, which focus on the individual philosophy of the appointee.
And it is
no less true of electoral process itself &#8212; witness the way the Federal
Elections Commission (FEC) is made up of partisan
appointments,<sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[91]</a></sup> or the ease with
which courts become involved in elections, despite obvious risks to their own
non-partisan image.<sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[92]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The role of money and the politicisation of all aspects of democratic process
itself are most obvious in two integral features of
US elections absent from
Australia. One is the razzle-dazzle of the party convention. Conventions plays a
bandwagon role in energising
activists and stimulating the wider public much
more than they serve their nominal role, within each party's rules, to endorse
candidates.
The other is the primary process. </p>
<p>In Australia, following the British model, parties as unincorporated
associations, use low-key, internal ballots or committees to
pre-select
candidates for endorsement. In the US, state legislation prescribes 'primary'
ballots in which members of the public can
vote to decide the parties'
candidates for the general election. Such open primaries evolved for reasons
tied historically to relieving
discrimination against African-Americans, and to
provide an extra level of democracy (they add an extra layer of participation,
and
in safe constituencies, ensure broader participation in what is, in effect,
the election that determines the election). Regardless
of the normative reasons
for them, primaries, like conventions, add colour, length and expense to the
election year or season in
the US. </p>
<p>Both of these elements &#8212; convention and primary &#8212; however do more
than add expense to the US election system. They also
transform the aesthetics
and ritual of the election process itself. Sometimes in obvious ways, such as
the ritual of rivals for major
party endorsement publicly mauling each other
with negative campaign techniques to attract primary support, before ultimately
closing
ranks after the party convention to focus on real opposition. And
sometimes in less obvious ways. For example, it is law in many
states that to
vote in a particular party's primary, one must register, if only for the time
being, as an adherent of that party.
Such registration is an administratively
quite formal act, carrying with it none of the loyalties or private law
obligations of being
a 'card-carrying' member of a political party under
Australian law. Conversely, though, it is also a public declaration of sympathy,
if not loyalty to a particular cause, whereas party membership in Australia is
entirely a private matter.</p>
<p>To identify different nuances in the electoral aesthetic in the US does not
however require us to abandon the claim that a core aversion
to money per se
inhabits electoral law there as it does elsewhere in the developed world. On the
contrary, driven by what could be
said to be a mixture of puritanical and
realist visions, US electoral law has obsessed over the role of money in
politics, and how
to regulate it, for more than a century. The Supreme Court has
repeatedly described the legislative record as an attempt 'to purge
national
politics of what [is] conceived to be the pernicious influence of "big money"
campaign contributions.'<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[93]</a></sup>
Regulators seek legal legitimacy (in the face of first amendment constraints),
to uphold limits on contributions or expenditures,
in a professed desire to
limit the actuality and appearance of political corruption.</p>
<p>Without diminishing the instrumental arguments for regulating money in
electoral politics, we can only make <i>complete</i> sense of the worldwide
interest in such regulation by acknowledging the aesthetic aversion to money in
politics. As argued earlier,
this aversion correlates with an idealist vision of
politics as a rhetorical domain. The key instrumental and normative concerns
are
easily identified. They are: staunching the fact or appearance of corruption,
keeping the electorate informed of possible chains
of influence, and equalising
political competition. Typically these are 'balanced' against liberty concerns,
such as freedom of expression.</p>
<p>If instrumental and normative concerns covered the whole of the landscape,
however, we could not explain why the media is not regulated
in the way that
money is. Conservative voices in the US have used this line of reasoning as if
it were a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>: if you regulate money in elections, you
must similarly regulate the media.</p>
<blockquote>
The chilling endpoint of [this] reasoning is not difficult to foresee: outright
regulation of the press. &#8230; Media corporations
are influential. There is
little doubt that the editorials and commentary they run can affect elections.
Nor is there any doubt that
media companies often wish to influence
elections.<sup><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[94]</a></sup></blockquote><p>John
McGinnis goes further, for example, arguing that no limits on campaign
expenditure are justifiable, to ensure legal neutrality
between different
classes of speaker. Limitations on money in politics, he laments:</p>
<blockquote>
would lead to a baleful dominance of our political life by those whose business
is to influence politics and culture &#8212; the
axis made up by the press, the
academy and
Hollywood.<a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[95]</a></blockquote><p>Campaign
expenditure regulation, he claims, privileges a 'whole class of people that
manipulates symbols for a living (we can call
them the "scribal class") &#8230;
Academics, Hollywood luminaries, and pundits of all kinds who fabricate ideas
for a living would
gain at the expense of those who produce a lot of material
goods for
society.'<a name="Document1zzSDUNumber6"></a><sup><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[96]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet expenditure restrictions are commonplace worldwide. They exist at, and
indeed have recently been tightened, for UK, Canadian,
and New Zealand
elections. Canada, for instance, sets a ceiling of Can$150 000 on 'third party'
electoral advertising (that is, by
ordinary citizens and corporations not
involved in the election as candidates or parties), including no more than
Can$3000 on any
particular constituency
race.<sup><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[97]</a></sup> Even the US, albeit for a
short period, attempted to restrict federal election advertising by third
parties to just US$1000;<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[98]</a></sup> and
strict limitations and regulations on contributions to federal candidates and
national party committees recently survived US
Supreme Court
scrutiny.<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[99]</a></sup> When it comes to
such restrictions, Australian law seems particularly laissez-faire, but that is
a relatively recent phenomenon.
For the first 80 years after Federation, federal
electoral law limited the amount a candidate could spend. Similar limits
survived
until 2002 in Victoria, and, persist in very strict form (applying to
any expenditure, whether by candidates or others) at Tasmanian
Upper House
elections.<sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>In response to McGinnis, proponents of regulation of money but not the media
might seek a purely pragmatic position. For example,
instrumental concerns
relating to corruption or its appearance may be most acute when monetary
contributions or electoral expenditures
are involved, because of money's
fluidity and its association with bribery, the paradigmatic form of corruption.
Or it may simply
be easier to regulate tangibles such as money than it is to
regulate speech as such, or the concentration of media ownership and
media
diversity.<sup><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[101]</a></sup> </p>
<p>But McGinnis's point is not just that the principle of legal neutrality ought
not be sacrificed merely to meet legislative expediency,
but that if electoral
law takes its instrumental concerns seriously, it has to deal directly with
media power. The media's ability
to shape electoral agendas and debate, and even
campaign for their favourite candidates and causes, raises the same concerns
with
corruption, undue influence and the fairness of electoral competition as
direct monetary contributions and expenditures. Yet <i>all</i> we require of the
media is that it take formal responsibility for its political and electoral
commentary. For example, Australian
newspapers must print the name and address
of someone taking responsibility for electoral comment (usually the chief
editor, and
usually in fine
print).<sup><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[102]</a></sup> This is the bare
<i>minimum</i> that is required of ordinary
citizens.<sup><a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[103]</a></sup></p>
<p>But if we remove the blinkers of traditional legal thought, pitting
rights-theory against instrumentalism in an often sterile stalemate,
we can see
that factors such as aesthetics supply the missing understanding. McGinnis's
'scribal class', of the media, the academy,
public intellectuals and the
cultural industry are not subject to electoral regulation in the same way that
those who seek to use
money directly to campaign, or indirectly to fund their
favourite parties. The aesthetic aversion to money in politics is founded
in a
positive <i>appreciation</i> of politics as a rhetorical domain. In such a
vision, a 'scribal class', which crafts it own ideas, words and images, for
offer to
the public, is practising politics in its ideal form. To allege that
the law favours such people over those who only have the wealth
of their labour
or capital to influence debate may raise interesting questions about the meaning
of 'equality' in electoral law and
democracy. But it is tautological to accuse
electoral law of discrimination when the law has a natural and innate preference
for
a model of political competition in which some qualities, such as creativity
and expression are preferred over others, such as economic
productivity or the
ability to organise money. </p>
<p>A discussion of money politics also reminds us that an aesthetic
understanding does not necessarily correlate with any particular
political
position. Admittedly, for several decades, aversion to money in politics has
been associated with the left of
politics.<sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[104]</a></sup> But an aversion to
money in politics can be a conservative as much as a progressive position. A
small example will illustrate. In
the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, William
Lecky advocated law reform in the UK so that election expenses would be charged
to rates, at least for candidates
who obtained considerable support at the
polls.<sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[105]</a></sup> In effect, he
foreshadowed, by nearly a century, the public funding system adopted in NSW in
1981 and followed federally in Australia
in 1983. But he did so not on leftist
arguments from political equality or fairness between the major parties, but out
of a conservative
sense that politics is a form of public duty, and a preference
for noble amateurs in the service of the public. Privately funded
elections, he
feared, encourage the wrong sort of rich men to enter politics, and lead them,
once elected, to graft to recover their
'investment'. Aesthetic considerations
know no party.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading226"></a><b>IV	CONCLUDING REMARKS</b></h3>
<p>The essay began with an apologia, noting that readers steeped in instrumental
or normative modes of thinking about public law might
be dubious about the
search for a ritual or aesthetic dimension to the law of politics. To anyone
schooled into believing theirs
is a uniquely 'rational' mode of understanding,
alternative accounts must seem speculative. Such an assumption is unfounded.
Accounts
working at high levels of abstraction (for example, 'representative
democracy') are no more likely to be empirically verifiable than
accounts drawn
from intuitive or experiential understandings. Attention to the ritual and
aesthetic elements of legal and social
practice is no less objective than
normative navel-gazing. Indeed, the two often rest harmoniously. Voting derives
much of its ritual
power from the depth of belief in democratic values, for
instance.</p>
<p>Appreciation of aesthetics and ritual has tended to be relegated to specific
sub-disciplines of the humanities. As a result, our ability
to appreciate the
full richness of human activities and social forms, especially in law, has been
stifled. The ritual and aesthetic
are inextricably part of the real: that is of
lived, everyday experience (rather than 'the real' of
psychoanalysis).<sup><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[106]</a></sup> Nor, to
quote Brian Butler in his commentary 'Aesthetics and American Law', must such
perspectives necessarily collapse into subjectivism
or relativism:</p>
<blockquote>
[A contest about aesthetics in law] need not &#8230; end the conversation with,
&#8243; Well, that's just the way I see things &#8243;.
Aesthetics need not
(indeed cannot) take us beyond the limits of rational inquiry and argument. The
aesthetic is always in an intimate
relationship with the rational. We can always
attempt to argue rationally between aesthetic accounts and premises of the law
just
as we have learned to do in dealing with any
art.<sup><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[107]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Some may
downplay the concept of the aesthetic because they fear it may degrade into a
formalist obsession with outward form over
substance. This is more than a narrow
confusion of 'aesthetics' with 'beauty'. There is a genuine social justice
concern that people
and causes that are 'attractive', in a broad sense, tend to
be favoured at the expense of real
justice.<sup><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[108]</a></sup> US Supreme Court
Justice Thomas even used the term 'racial aesthetics' judicially, to deride the
use of quotas to create ethnically
balanced law school
classes.<sup><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[109]</a></sup> A concern with
aesthetics may also be seen as dandified. Poets may be the unacknowledged
legislators of the world; but if they were
the real legislators, our laws would
be even more contradictory than they already are! Similarly, a concern with
ritual may lead
to an obsession with form over substance.  </p>
<p>But these objections do not undermine the project mapped out in this essay.
The aesthetic and ritual dimensions to electoral law described
here are not to
be confused with the aesthetic as the superficial or the ritual as mere form. On
the contrary, they capture some
of the human experiences, the sensations and
meanings &#8212; in broad terms the <i>values</i> &#8212; lived out in a life
lived under and through law, which are otherwise invisible to the traditional
normative and instrumental
approaches to law. As Pierre Bourdieu wrote, children
become human through 'a pattern of postures that is both individual and
systematic
... and charged with a host of social meanings and
values'.<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[110]</a></sup> So too, we learn to
be citizens through such patterns. Bourdieu identified such patterns as
generating a 'bodily <i>hexis</i>', a set of physical practices through which we
are ordered as people and as a social whole:</p>
<blockquote>
a political mythology realized, <i>em-bodied</i>, turned into a permanent
disposition, a durable manner of standing, speaking, and thereby of
<i>feeling</i> and
<i>thinking</i>.<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[111]</a></sup></blockquote><hr><p><sup><a name="fn1" href="#fnB1">[*]</a></sup> 	Senior Lecturer, Law Faculty,

a vote <i>anytime</i> during the election period. The ban has narrowed to
prohibit just solicitation by candidates on polling day. See Dean Jaensch,
<i>Community Access to the Parliamentary Electoral Processes in South Australia
Since 1850</i> (2002) 93&#8211;4. The original ban was motivated in part by a
desire to crack down on opportunities to bribe individual voters,
but more so on
a feeling that personal solicitation offended ballot secrecy.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn45" href="#fnB45">[44]</a></sup> 	In some, they are accepted
to the point of micro-regulation: eg Queensland requires registration and
stipulates font size, to minimise
confusion: <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ea1992103/" class="autolink_findacts">Electoral Act 1992</a></i> (Qld) ss
161A- B.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn46" href="#fnB46">[45]</a></sup> 	The ACT and Tasmania are
exceptions. At their Assembly elections, the exclusion zone is 100m:

133(2). Such a buffer practically relegates 'how-to-vote' cards to anonymous
letterboxing, but in any event 'how-to-vote'
cards are of limited practical
value in either jurisdiction, since although parties stand lists of candidates,
there is no single
ballot paper to reproduce because the order of candidate
names is juggled on different batches (via 'Robson Rotation'). </p>

Orr, Bryan Mercurio and

deeper, 'Benthamite' desire to ensure 'rational policymaking guided by the
accurate registering of all preferences.'</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn48" href="#fnB48">[47]</a></sup> 	Joan Rydon, a political
science Professor, was the most vociferous and long-standing opponent of
compulsion. She (twice) famously
wrote that: 'In Australia where the apathetic
and ill-informed are forced to the polls by law, it is even more likely that the
"scum
and dregs" of political life will decide who is to govern the country.'
Joan Rydon, 'The Electorate' in John Wilkes (ed), <i>Forces in Australian
Politics</i> (1963) 167, 184. That claim is not quite as elitist as it may
sound: it echoes a line of Bernard Shaw, where 'scum' means those who
undeservedly rise to the top of society as much as 'dregs' are those anchored to
the bottom. (George Bernard Shaw, <i>Man and Superman: a Comedy and a
Philosophy</i> (1903) 81: &#8216;We are dregs and scum, sir: the dregs very
filthy, the scum very superior.&#8217;)</p>

<p><sup><a name="fn50" href="#fnB50">[49]</a></sup> 	A curious exception
involves Norfolk Islanders, for whom enrolment is not compulsory:

the point: the Islanders' special status is essentially a symbolic exemption,
reflecting their desire to
distinguish themselves as people on the periphery of
'Australianness'.</p>

<p><sup><a name="fn52" href="#fnB52">[51]</a></sup> 	Obviously there are
exceptions for the sick or the isolated, most notably the postal ballot. But as
'declaration votes' &#8212;
the formal legal term for such exceptions &#8212;
implies, these are truly exceptions to the norm of polling in person at a public
place. The elector must by declaration, on pain of penalty, prove herself
entitled to an exemption. (For the definition of a 'declaration
vote' see

<p><sup><a name="fn92" href="#fnB92">[91]</a></sup> 	The FEC has a 3&#8211;3
balance between Democrat and Republican nominees, but even that merely reflects
an entrenched bipartisanship,
as if other parties did not exist. At the most
basic level, election law from the design of ballots to counting of votes, is
run
by partisan officials. For a brief account of how this inflamed the
imbroglio over the 2000 presidential election, see Daniel Lowenstein,

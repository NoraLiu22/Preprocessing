    <h3 id="p01">Privacy notice</h3>
    <p>The Government of Canada and the Parks Canada Agency (Parks Canada) are committed to providing websites that respect the privacy of visitors. This privacy notice summarizes the privacy practices for Parks Canada's online activities.</p>
    <p>All personal information collected by this institution is governed by the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html"><cite>Privacy Act</cite></a>. This means that you will be informed of the purpose for which your personal information is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.</p>
    <h4>Your privacy and the internet</h4>
    <p>The nature of the Internet is such that Web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a website, including the visitor's Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the Internet. Web servers automatically log the IP addresses of visitors to their sites. The IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an ISP for example, it could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this reason, the Government of Canada considers the IP address to be personal information, particularly when combined with other data automatically collected when visitor requests a Web page such as the page or pages visited, date and time of the visit.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>Unless otherwise noted, Parks Canada does not automatically gather any specific information from you, such as your name, telephone number or email address. Parks Canada would obtain this type of information only if you supply it to us, for example, by email or by filling in a contact form. In such cases, how your personal information is handled will be provided in a Personal Information Collection Statement.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In cases where services are provided by organizations outside of the Government of Canada, such as social media platforms or mobile applications, IP addresses may be recorded by the Web server of the third-party service provider.</p>
    <h4>Communicating with the Government of Canada</h4>
    <p>If you choose to send Parks Canada an email or complete a feedback form online, your personal information is used by Parks Canada in order to respond to your inquiry. The information you provide will only be shared with another government institution if your inquiry relates to that institution. Parks Canada does not use the information to create individual profiles nor does it disclose the information to anyone other than to those in the federal government who need to provide you with a response. Any disclosure of your personal information is in accordance with the <cite>Privacy Act</cite>.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <p>Emails and other electronic methods used to communicate with the Government of Canada are not secure unless it is specifically stated on a Web page.</p>
    <p class="mrgn-lft-md">Therefore, it is recommended that you <strong>do not</strong> send sensitive personal information, such as your Social Insurance Number or your date of birth, through non-secure electronic means.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Personal information from emails or completed feedback forms is collected pursuant to the <cite>Parks Canada Act</cite>. Such information may be used for statistical, evaluation and reporting purposes and is included in Personal Information Bank <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/information-about-programs-information-holdings/standard-personal-information-banks.html#psu914">Public Communications (PSU 914)</a>.</p>
    <h4>Third-party social media</h4>
    <p>Parks Canada's use of social media serves as an extension of its presence on the Web. Social media account(s) are public and are not hosted on Government of Canada servers. Users who choose to interact with us via social media should read the terms of service and privacy policies of these third-party service providers and those of any applications you use to access them. Parks Canada uses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/u/2/privacy?hl=en-CA&amp;hl=en">YouTube</a>.</p>
    <p>Personal information that you provide to the Government of Canada via social media account(s) is collected under the authority of the <cite>Parks Canada Act</cite>. This information is collected to capture conversations (e.g. questions and answers, comments, "likes", retweets) between you and Parks Canada. It may be used to respond to inquiries, or for statistical, evaluation and reporting purposes. Comments posted that violate Canadian law will be deleted and disclosed to law enforcement authorities. Comments that violate our rules of engagement will also be deleted. The personal information is included in Personal Information Bank <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/information-about-programs-information-holdings/standard-personal-information-banks.html#psu938">Outreach Activities (PSU 938)</a>.</p>
    <h4>Improving your experience on Government of Canada websites</h4>
    <h5>Digital markers (including cookies)</h5>
    <p>A digital marker is a resource created by the visitors' browser in order to remember certain pieces of information for the Web server to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the website. Examples of digital markers are "cookies" or <abbr title="Hypertext mark-up language">HTML</abbr>5 web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:</p>
    <div class="well well-sm">
    <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-info"></span>They allow a website to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the site;</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-info"></span>They track what information is viewed on a site which helps website administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking for.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Parks Canada uses sessional digital markers on some portions of its website. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data with Parks Canada's Web server. The digital markers used do not allow Parks Canada to identify individuals.</p>
    <p>You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including cookies, if you so choose. However, it may affect your ability to interact with Parks Canada's website.</p>
    <h4>Web analytics</h4>
    <p>Web analytics is the collection, analysis, measurement, and reporting of data about Web traffic and visits for purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage. Information in digital markers may be used for the purpose of web analytics to remember your online interactions with Parks Canada's website.</p>
    <p>Parks Canada uses Google Analytics reporting service to improve its website. When your computer requests a Parks Canada web page, our institution collects certain types of information. For the purposes of the Privacy Act, this information is treated as personal information. The type of information collected includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <div class="well">
    <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Network location and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you used to contact our Web site;</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Name of the domain you used to access the Internet (.com, .org, .net, .ca, etc.);</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Type of browser you used;</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Type of operating system you used (Windows, Mac OS, etc.)</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Date and time you accessed the site;</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Pages you have accessed and the documents you have downloaded; and</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site, if applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Parks Canada may also use the personal information collected for non-administrative uses, such as communications and information technology statistics, audit and evaluations, content personalisation and testing, research, planning, and reporting. This use of the personal information will never result in an administrative decision about an individual or to profile individual visitors to pc.gc.ca.</p>
    <p>Parks Canada carries out web analytics using services from the third-party service provider Google Inc. (Google Analytics). This service provider is based in the United States of America (USA), which means that the personal information collected is transmitted outside of Canada and may be subject to USA laws, including the USA Patriot Act. In addition, Google operates servers in other countries on which the web analytics data may be processed. Consequently, the data may be subject to the governing legislation of the country where it is processed. Personal information is set to expire after 14 months, this includes IP addresses and any other personal information including, but not limited to, information in digital markers used in relation to Web analytics.</p>
    <p>To track visits to Pc.gc.ca for web analytics, Google Analytics requires the use of digital markers (&ldquo;cookies&rdquo;). If you wish, you may opt out of having your visit tracked by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Changing your browser settings to refuse cookies, disabling JavaScript within your browser, or</li>
        <li>Downloading and installing a browser add-on from <a title="Google tracking opt out add-on">Google</a> that prevents your visit data from being used</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To further protect information about visitors to pc.gc.ca, Parks Canada uses a feature from each service provider that hides part or all of the IP address of a visitor before it is stored.</p>
    <p>For more information about the privacy policy of these Google services, please visit their website or use the following link:</p>

    </ul>
    <h4>Google reCAPTCHA</h4>
    <p>Occasionally, the Parks Canada website may use <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/">Google reCAPTCHA</a>. This security feature helps us protect our website from spam by trying to identify if a user is human or an automated program (also known as a &ldquo;robot&rdquo; or a &ldquo;bot&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>Your interactions with reCAPTCHA will be disclosed to Google. This means that your IP address and other data collected by reCAPTCHA are sent to Google&rsquo;s servers in the United States of America and processed there to determine how likely you are to be a human and not an automated program. Natural Resources Canada does not collect or have access to the information collected by reCAPTCHA and Google.</p>
    <p>For more information, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Google&rsquo;s Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en">Terms of Service</a> pages.</p>
    <h4>Protecting the security of Government of Canada websites</h4>
    <p>Parks Canada employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. This software receives and records the IP address of the computer that has contacted our website, the date and time of the visit and the pages visited. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting our site unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected.</p>
    <p>This information is collected pursuant to <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-18.html#230436">section 161 of the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite></a>. The information may be shared with appropriate law enforcement authorities if suspected criminal activities are detected. Such information may be used for network security related statistical purposes, audit, evaluation, research, planning and reporting and is included in Personal Information Bank <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/information-about-programs-information-holdings/standard-personal-information-banks.html#psu939">Security Incidents (PSU 939)</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="p07">Interacting with Parks Canada on social media</h3>
    <p>This notice has been written to explain how Parks Canada interacts with the public on social media platforms.</p>
    <h4>Parks Canada's social media profiles</h4>
    <p>Parks Canada maintains official profiles on a variety of social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. Parks Canada operates national profiles as well as profiles for specific national heritage places, regional clusters of national heritage places and Parks Canada programs. All Parks Canada social media profiles are available in both English and French versions.</p>
    <h4>Content and frequency</h4>
    <p>We use our social media accounts as an alternative method of sharing the content posted on our website and interacting with our stakeholders. By following our social media accounts (by "following," "liking", "subscribing", etc.), you can expect to see information about the national heritage places Parks Canada administers, as well as the programs and services we provide.</p>
    <p>We understand that the Web is a 24/7 medium, and your comments are welcome at any time. You should expect to see new content posted from Monday to Friday between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm of the local time zone specific to each profile. Parks Canada's national channels are operated within the EST/EDT zone, whereas our profiles related to specific national heritage places, or regions within Canada, operate within the local time zone of those locations. We may occasionally post content or respond to comments on weekends and beyond the hours mentioned above, but this is not a regular practice. Comments submitted after hours or on weekends will be read and responded to as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>Many national heritage places managed by Parks Canada are operated on a seasonal basis, with reduced services or closure during the off-season. You should expect the regularity of postings by profiles for seasonal locations to decrease, or possibly cease during the off-season. In these cases, we will notify our followers via those profiles if channels are entering periods of reduced usage. In such cases you can continue to interact with Parks Canada's other local or national social media profiles, or contact Parks Canada directly via email or telephone. For alternative means to contact us please refer to the Public Questions or Media Requests section below.</p>
    <p>Because the servers of social media platforms are managed by a third party, our social media accounts are subject to downtime that may be out of our control. As such, we accept no responsibility for platforms becoming unresponsive or unavailable.</p>
    <h4>Links to other websites and ads</h4>
    <p>Our social media accounts may post or display links or ads for websites that are not under our control. These links are provided solely for the convenience of users. The Government of Canada is not responsible for the information found through these links or ads, nor does it endorse the sites or their content.</p>
    <h4>Following, "favouriting" and subscribing</h4>
    <p>Our decision to "follow," "favourite" or "subscribe" to another social media account does not imply an endorsement of that account, channel, page or site, and neither does sharing (re-tweeting, reposting or linking to) content from another user.</p>
    <h4>Comments and interaction</h4>
    <p>We will read comments and participate in discussions when appropriate. We ask that your comments be relevant and respectful. We reserve the right to delete comments that violate this notice, and the user may be blocked and reported to prevent further inappropriate comments.</p>
    <p>We cannot engage in issues of party politics or answer questions that break the rules of this notice.</p>

    <p>We reply to comments in the official language in which they are posted. If we think the response is a question of general public interest, we may respond in both official languages.</p>
    <p>We may share links that direct users to sites of organizations or other entities that are not subject to the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/o-3.01/"><cite>Official Languages Act</cite></a> and available only in the language(s) in which they are written. When content is available in only one language, we make an effort to provide similar content in the other official language.</p>
    <h4>Public questions and media requests</h4>
    <p>Although we try to respond to many public questions and comments posed to our social media profiles, we cannot guarantee replies in every instance. Public inquiries requiring responses should be directed to Parks Canada's official telephone numbers, mail or email addresses for public correspondence. You may find a list of both national and location-specific contact information on our <a href="https://parks.canada.ca/agence-agency/courriel-email">Contact us</a> webpage.</p>

    <h4>Use of personal information</h4>

first search was to look at musical practice in ancient times, not
only in Europe but all over the world. There were several other
musical scales besides the diatonic scale, where the semitones were
located in other places than from me-fa and si-do. In the Gregorian
modals, for instance, the different placement of the semitones
creates the specific modes. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>In pentatonic folk music
semitones do not exist. By practical experience, people have found
out that the five-note scale allowed the possibility of playing in
any key without significant disharmony. Theorists would say that the
scale was composed of ascending and descending fifths, only in two
steps in each direction. A pentatonic scale can be played by only
using the black keys on the piano. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>After a study of ancient
main cultural music, mainly Chinese and Indian, I realized how
universal the concept of the octave was in every musical
culture.<BR>According to Helmholtz, the Arabic and Persian scales,
and the Japanese and the Pacific scales are also within an octave.
However, the division of the octave differs from culture to
culture.<BR>Arab music divides the octave into sixteen unequal
intervals. The Persians divided their octave into 24 steps, so they
must have used quarter tones. From excavated Egyptian flutes, a seven
note scale C, D, E, F#, G, A, B, has been discovered, which is
identical with the Syntolydian scale of ancient Greece. Japanese
music used mainly a pentatonic scale.</FONT></FONT></P>

music</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Music was the
cornerstone of the Chinese civilization, the longest living culture
in history. It was considered to embody within its tones elements of
the celestial order. The audible sound, including music, was but one
form of manifestation of a much more fundamental form of
Super-physical Sound. The fundamental Primal Sound was synonymous
with that which the Hindus call OM. The Chinese believed that this
Primal Sound, Kung or &lsquo;Huang Chung&rsquo; (directly translated
&lsquo;yellow bell&rsquo;) was, though inaudible, present everywhere
as a Divine Vibration.<BR>Furthermore, it was also divided into 12
lesser Sounds or Tones. These twelve Cosmic Tones were emanations of,
and an aspect of, the Primal Sound, but were closer in vibration to
the tangible, physical world. Each of the 12 Tones was associated
with one of the <A HREF="http://vaczy.dk/htm/zodiac.htm">12 zodiacal
regions</A> of the heavens.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Audible sound was
conceived as being a physical level manifestation of the 12 tones.
Sound on Earth was a kind of sub-tone of the celestial vibration. It
was believed to contain a little part of the celestial tones' divine
power.<BR>&ldquo;As above, so below&rdquo;, as the Egyptian Hermes
Thot said. In the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, a similar wish is spoken.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>For the ancient Chinese,
the <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">alignment</FONT> with the divine prime tone
was the Emperor's most important task. The alignment of earth with
heaven, and man with the Supreme, was literally the purpose of life.
The entire order and affairs of the State were dependent upon the
right tuning of the fundamental tone, the &lsquo;yellow bell&rsquo;,
or Kung. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>As an ancient text
warns: &ldquo;If the Kung is disturbed, then there is
disorganization; the prince is arrogant.&rdquo; <BR>If the Kung was
out of tune, because the celestial realm has changed, disorder and
inharmonious behavior in society became obvious. Every instrument
(including measuring instruments) was tuned and utilized in
accordance with the holy tone.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The instrument that
could give to man the fundamental tone for a musical scale in perfect
harmony with the universe was the key to earthly paradise, and
essential to the security and evolution of society.<BR>It became the
Chinese Holy Grail.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One
legend tells of the amazing journey of Ling Lun, a minister of the
second legendary Chinese Emperor, Huang Ti. Ling Lun was sent like an
ancient Knight of King Arthur to search for a special and unique set
of bamboo pipes. These pipes were so perfect that they could render
the precise standard pitches to which all other instruments
throughout the land could be tuned.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>That sacred tone, which
relates to the Western modern pitch of F, was considered as the
fundamental cosmic tone. The Chinese were aware of the slow changing
cosmic influence, and consequently the Kung has to change
accordingly. The Emperor had the task of tuning the Kung so it was in
alignment with the cosmic tone.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Cousto has in his book
The Cosmic Octave an interesting observation on this matter. He
relates the <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">Kung to the frequency of the
Platonic Year.</FONT> The duration of the Platonic Year, (The
Pythagorean Great Year) is about 25,920 years and represents the
amount of time the axis of the Earth takes to complete a full
rotation.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The vernal equinox is
the point at which the equator (of Earth) intersects the ecliptic (or
zodiac), which is the position of the sun at the beginning of spring
- March 21st.<BR>The vernal equinox takes an average of 2,160 years
to travel through one sign of the zodiac. This period of time is
known as an age. It is not possible to state exactly when one age is
ending and a new beginning, because the signs overlap to a certain
degree.&nbsp;<BR>The journey of the vernal equinox through each of
the 12 signs of the Zodiac equals one great year of approximately
25,920 years. (Presently we are on the cusp of Aquarius as the age of
Pisces is ending).&nbsp;<BR>This number of years is close to the high
number of <A HREF="http://vaczy.dk/htm/octave2.htm#cycle%20of%20fifths">generating

<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Cousto
calculates the note of the Platonic year to be F in the Western Equal
Temperament pitch, which is found in the 48th octave with a frequency
of 344.12 Hz.,&nbsp;or in the 47th octave to be 172.06 Hz. Note that
the corresponding a' has a frequency of 433.564 Hz. (Modern Western
concert pitch is 440 Hz.)</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><BR>Calculation:
31 556 925.97(the tropical year in seconds) * 25,920 (Platonic year).
Since the length (of a vibrating string, or the period of time) is in
reverse proportionality to the frequency, the length of the Platonic
year in seconds shall be the denominator. The frequency is very low,
so we will raise the frequency to the range of hearing by multiplying
with the necessary amount of octaves, e.g. 48 octaves so we arrive to
344,12 Hz. (47 octaves will be the half, 172,06 Hz.)<BR>If we want to
reach the spectrum of light, we multiply with 89 octaves which leads
us to a frequency of 1/31 556 925.97 * 1/25 920 * 2 89 = 7,56 * 10 14
Hz. corresponding to a wavelength of 0.396 micrometer, which we
perceive as violet near the ultra violet. This is the color of the
Platonic Year. The complementary color to violet is yellow. Their
fundamental tone was called the yellow bell.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>It is a wonder for me
how the ancient Chinese could be aware of their sacred fundamental
tone, Kung, being in accordance with the Platonic Year, and choose
the great rhythm of the Earth.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Creation
of a scale</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>It might be a surprise
that the diatonic scale was the foundation for the ancient Chinese
and the Indian music, though the musical theory and practices differ
from the Western.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>For the old Chinese,
their musical scale was developed by the circle of perfect fifths up
to 60 degrees or keys, the 60 L&uuml;, though they usually only used
the first 5 fifths in their pentatonic music, because they knew that
these represent the limit of consonance in modal music. In addition,
the ancient Chinese saw a symbolic representation in the pentatonic
scale, rooted in their belief in music as being the representation of
the relationship between heaven and earth (the five elements).&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The Chinese were well
aware centuries ago of the existence of our modern Equal Temperament.
They dismissed such a tempered scale not only for its badly false
notes, but mainly because the tuning was not in alignment with&nbsp;the
cosmic tone.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According
to the book by David Taime, The Secret Power of Music, 3 was the
symbolic numeral of heaven and 2 that of the earth; sounds in the
ratio of 3:2 will harmonize heaven and earth. As a way to apply that
important concept, the Chinese took the foundation note, &lsquo;Huang
Chung&rsquo;, and from it produced a second note in the ratio of 3:2.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>A more in-depth
explanation made by Alain Dani&eacute;lou in his &rdquo;Music and the
Power of Sound&rdquo;:<BR>&ldquo;Music, being the representation of
the relationship between heaven and earth, must quite naturally have
this confirmation of a center or tonic (gong) surrounded by four
notes assimilated to the four directions of space, the four
perceptible elements, the four seasons, and so on.&nbsp;&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The pentatonic
scale thus presents a structure that allows it to be an adequate
representation of the static influence of heaven on earth. But a
static representation of a world in motion could not be an instrument
of action upon that world. It is necessary to evolve from the
motionless to the moving, from the angular to the circular, from the
square to the circle. To express the movements of the universe, the
sounds will have to submit to the cyclic laws that, in their own
field, are represented by the cycle of fifths.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>

Europe, where the tritone was prohibited as diabolical, that is, as

timbre, etc. Furthermore, and very important, <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">the
whole spiritual being of the musician himself was crucial.</FONT>
That applies also to Indian music. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>As in the Western
diatonic scale, the Indian scale was based on 7 main notes: SA, RE,
GA, MA, PA, DHA and NI. If we go back to the most ancient texts on
music, the scales were divided into <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">two
tetrachords</FONT>, similar to the ancient Greeks, and later put
together with a whole tone (9/8) between, Ma &ndash; Pa, so a full
octave was completed.&nbsp;<BR>The Indian notes relate broadly to the
Western ratios, though the tuning is very harmonious and creates a
world of difference. We have to emphasize that the use of harmony as
we know it was, but is no longer, musically practised.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Here is a crucial point.
The Indian music is <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">modal</FONT>.&nbsp;There is
a strong relationship to the tonic. When a third is played it always
relates to the third degree; whereas in Western harmonious tradition
the third has a relative position, because it can be the root, the
fifth or third of a chord.&nbsp;<BR>Eastern listeners often make
remarks such as: &ldquo;Beethoven symphonies are interesting, but why
have all those chords been introduced, spoiling the charm of the
melodies?&rdquo;<BR>The modal music of India is '<FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">horizontal</FONT>'
as the Western is '<FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">vertical</FONT>'. The
vertical, harmonious system, in which the group of related sounds is
given simultaneously, might be more direct though also less clear.
The accurate discrimination of the different elements that constitute
a chord is not usually possible.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The modal, horizontal
system, on the other hand, allows the exact perception and immediate
classification of every note, and therefore permits a much more
accurate, powerful and detailed outlining of what the music
expresses.<BR>One can say that </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>the
attention span </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>in
the Eastern musical language has to be much longer since, in time,
the different and distinct sounds adding up in the listeners mind
create the chords or the whole musical idea. Only then, by
remembering with attention all the elements that constitute the
musical image,&nbsp;can the full meaning finally be understood.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><BR>The
Indian musical system operates with a combination of fixed and
mutable pitch, so the key can be recognized along with variable
notes. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th notes are variable, but the 1st
(Sa or Do) and the perfect 5th (Pa or Sol) are immutable and of a
fixed pitch. The drone is accordingly often Do-Sol (Sa-Pa), which
becomes the ultimate open chord containing all other notes within it
as a series of subtle harmonics.<BR>This drone (a constant note or
tonic), whether actually played on an instrument like the tampura or
simply heard within oneself as the Om sound, is the constant
reference without which no Indian musician would play.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>One must not be
confused&nbsp;by the vast use of micro intervals, sliding or bending
the notes, prominent in Indian music. The musicians can freely use
these microtones as private points, often moving freely between two
notes as a kind of infinitely exploitable space, eventually returning
home to the tonic of the Raga. The musician has a freedom to play
tones as his inspiration demands so long as he obeys the sacred rules
of types and its mood.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
22 Shrutis (degrees)</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Musical intervals can be
defined in two ways, either by numbers (string lengths, frequencies)
or by their <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">psychological</FONT>
correspondences, such as feelings and images they necessarily evoke
in our minds. There is no sound without a meaning, so the Indians
consider the <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">emotions</FONT> that different
intervals evoke as exact as sound ratios. The feeling of the shrutis
depends exclusively on their position in relation to the tonic, and
indicates the key for the ragas.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The 22 different keys or
degrees encompass what the Indians consider the most common feelings
and reflections of the human mind. They were aware of the division of
the octave into 53 equal parts, the Pythagorean Comma, and its
harmonic equivalent, the comma diesis, (the syntonic comma, the
difference between the major and the minor tones). <BR>However, they
chose the 22nd division of the octave for reasons based on the limit
of human ability to differentiate the keys, as well as for
psychological and metaphysical reasons.&nbsp;The symbolic
correspondences of the numbers 22 and 7, (7 strings and main notes),
could also play a part since the relationship between the circle and
the diameter is expressed as the approximate value of Pi, 22/7.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
modal or Harmonic division of the octave</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Indian music is
essentially modal, which means that the intervals on which the
musical structure is built are calculated in relation to a permanent
tonic. That does not mean that the relations between notes other than
the tonic are not considered, but that each note will be established
first according to its relation to the fixed tonic and not, as in the
case of cycle of fifths, by any permutations of the basic note.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The modal structure can
therefore be compared to the <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">proportional</FONT>
division of the string (straight line) rather than to the periodic
movement of the spiral of fifths.<BR>All the notes obtained in the
harmonic system are distinct from those of the cyclic system, which
is based on different data. Though the notes are theoretically
distinct and their sequence follows completely different rules, in
practice they lead to a similar division of the octave into
fifty-three intervals.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><A NAME="table2"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
scale of proportions is made of a succession of <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">syntonic
commas</FONT>, 81/80, which divide the octave into 53 intervals.
Among those, 22 notes were chosen for their specific emotional
expressions:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The ancient Egyptians
had similar beliefs to the Chinese and Hindus. In their Book of the
Dead and other sources, it is stated that God, or his lesser servant
gods, created everything, by combining visualization with utterance.
First the god would visualize the thing that was to be formed; then
he would pronounce its name: and it would be.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>From as late as the
reign of Alexander II, a text dating from about 310 BC still has the
God of Creation, Ra, declaring: &ldquo;Numerous are the forms from
that which proceeded from my mouth.&rdquo; The god Ra was also called
Amen-Ra, with the prefix &lsquo;Amen&rsquo;. The Egyptian priesthood
understood well the word Amen, or AMN, and it was equated with the
Hindu OM.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Egyptian music, as does
Greek, most probably had its roots in Indian music, or at least in
that universal system of modal music whose tradition has been fully

the four seasons, four directions of space, etc.; especially the

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The Greek philosopher
Pythagoras (570 - 490 BC) spent 22 years in Egypt, mainly with the
high priest in Memphis, where he became initiated into their secret
knowledge of Gods. When the Persians conquered Egypt, he was kept in
captivity in Babylon for sixteen years before he could return to
Greece and begin his teaching.&nbsp;<BR>I began to study the theory
of the Pythagoreans and their esoteric schools. Very little is known
of them. Pythagoras demanded silence about the esoteric work. This
historic school was founded in the Greek colony Kroton, in southern
Italy, about 2,500 years ago.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>I realized after reading
dozens of books about the matter what an outstanding role that school
played in the establishment of western civilization. He created an
entirely new concept. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Any person - man or woman
- who had a sincere wish for knowledge could enter the school
stepwise, with a number of initiations. </FONT>The tradition of a
priesthood&rsquo;s monopoly of knowledge of God was broken.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Pythagoras' study of the
moving string and his discovery of the harmonic progression of simple
whole numbers was the first real scientific work and creation of
modern science. But his vision went far beyond present science in his

of Gerasa</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Nicomachus the
Pythagorean (second century B.C.) was the first who wrote about
Pythagoras&rsquo; legendary encounter with &lsquo;the harmonious
blacksmith&rsquo; and the&nbsp;weights of the 4 different hammers
being 12, 9, 8 and 6, that determined the variation in the pitches
Pythagoras heard. <BR>This story illustrates how the numerical
proportions of the notes were discovered. His methodical measuring of
the hammers and how the sound was produced and related (collecting
data), then making experiments with strings, their tension and
lengths (repeating the findings and, with mathematics, formulating
them into a law), was the first example of the scientific method.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>We will not dwell on the
question of the force of the impact or the tension of the strings,
which later was discovered as the square root of the force, but just
stick to the proportion of weights and the pitches he heard, which
led him to his discovery.<BR>Pythagoras' experiments led to the
combination of <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">two tetrachords, (two fourths),
separated with a whole tone, 9/8</FONT>, which constitute an octave.
He changed the traditional unit in Greek music, the tetrachord, into
the octave by an octachord.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>In the time of
Pythagoras the tradition was strongly based on the seven strings of
the lyre, the heptachord. The Greeks considered the number 7 sacred
and given by the god Hermes, who handed down the art of lyre playing
to Orpheus. The seven-string lyre was also related to the seven
planets, amongst other things the ancients venerated. <BR>The lyre
often, but not always, consisted of seven strings comprising two
tetrachords, each one spanning the most elementary concord, the
fourth, both joined together on the note mese.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="border: 1.00pt solid #000000; padding: 0.05cm 0.11cm"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According
to legend, a son of Apollo, Linos, invented the four-stringed lyre
with three intervals, a semitone, whole tone and a whole tone
comprising a fourth; the fourth, &lsquo;the first and most elementary
consonance&rsquo; as Nicomathus calls it, and from which all the
musical scales of ancient Greek music eventually developed.<BR>Trepander
of Antissa on Lesbos, born about 710 B.C., assumed a mythological
status for his musical genius. His most lasting contribution was
perhaps his transformation of the four-stringed lyre to the
instrument which became institutionalized by tradition to the
heptachord.<BR>Trepander did before Pythagoras extend the heptachord
from its minor seventh limits to a full octave, but without having to
add the forbidden eighth string.<BR>He removed the Bb string, the
trite of the conjunct tetrachord, and added the octave string, E1,
yielding a scale of E F G A C D E1.<BR>This arrangement left a gap of
a minor third between A and C, and seemed to have enhanced the Dorian
character of Trepander's composition.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Harmonia</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Only Pythagoras escaped
censure for adding an eighth string to the ancient and venerated lyre
because of his position as a great master and religious prophet. His
purpose was to teach man the unifying principle and immutable laws of
harmonia by appealing to his highest powers - the rational intellect
and not to his untrustworthy and corruptible senses. Pythagoras
altered the heptachord solely to engage man's intellect in proper
&lsquo;fitting together&rsquo; - <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">harmonia</FONT>
- of the mathematical proportions.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Plutarch (44-120 B.C.)
states that for Pythagoras and his disciples, the word harmonia meant
&lsquo;octave&rsquo; in the sense of an attunement which manifests
within its limits both the proper fitting together of the concordant
intervals, fourth and fifth, and the difference between them, the
whole tone.&nbsp;<BR>Moreover, Pythagoras proved that whatever can be
said of one octave can be said of all octaves. For every octave, no
matter what pitch range it encompasses, repeats itself without
variation throughout the entire pitch range in music. For that
reason, Pythagoras considered it sufficient to limit the study of
music to the octave.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>This means that within
the framework of any octave, no matter what its particular pitch
range, there is a mathematically ordained place for the fourth, the
fifth, and for the whole tone. It is a mathematical matter to show
that all of the ratios involved in the structure of the octave are
comprehended by the single construct: <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">12-9-8-6</FONT>.&nbsp;<BR>For
the Pythagoreans, this construct came to constitute the essential
paradigm - of unity from multiplicity.</FONT></FONT></P>

the harmonic mean is 2ac/a+c, or in this series, 2*12*6/12+6 = 8.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Among the peculiar
properties of the harmonic proportion is the fact that the ratio of
the greatest term to the middle is greater than the middle to the

theory, these two proportions are basic for division of the octave
since the fifth, 3/2, is the <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">arithmetic</FONT>
mean of an octave and the fourth, 4/3, is the <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">harmonic</FONT>
mean of an octave.<BR>The principle of dividing the string by an
arithmetical proportion is done by the formula: a:b is divided by
2a:(a+b) and (a+b):2b.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>We have already seen
that in the diatonic genus each tetrachord was divided into two full
tones and one semitone. A full tone derives from a fifth minus a
fourth, 3/2 - 4/3 = 9/8. The semitone will be 4/3 - (9/8 + 9/8), or
4/3 - 81/64 = 256/243.&nbsp;<BR>This semitone is called leimma, and
is somewhat smaller than the half tone computed by dividing (for
musical ratios dividing means the square root) the whole tone in
half: (9/8)<SUP>&frac12;</SUP> = 3/2*2<SUP>&frac12;</SUP>. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The square root of 2 was
for the Pythagoreans a shocking fact, because their concept of
rational numbers was shattered. (For me it represents the beauty of
real science, because it revealed the flaws in the Pythagorean
paradigm of numbers). Their own mathematic proved with the
Pythagoreans&rsquo; doctrine of the right-angle triangle (the sum of
the squares of the two smaller sides of a right-angled triangle is
equal to the square of the hypotenuse) that in music, as in geometry,
there are fractions, m/n, that are <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">incommensurables</FONT>
&ndash; such as the square root of 2, which cannot be expressed with
whole numbers or fractions, the body of rational numbers, but with
irrational numbers not yet developed. <BR>This discovery was held as
a secret among the Pythagoreans and led to the separation of algebra
and geometry for centuries, until&nbsp;Descartes in the 17th century
united them again. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>For music it meant that

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>We have to bear in mind
that Pythagoras himself left no written record of his work; it was
and is against esoteric principles. Neither did those few students
who survived the pogrom of Pythagoras. It is one in the <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">next</FONT>
generation of Pythagoreans, Philolaus (ca.480- ? B.C.), who broke the
precept of writing down the master&rsquo;s teaching. However,
Philolaus' records are lost, so it is Nicomachus&rsquo; fragments of
his writing, in his Manual of Harmonics, that is actually the only
source posterity has.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>According to Nicomachus
/ Philolaus, the whole tone, 9/8, was divided differently from&nbsp;the
Pythagoreans method, by representing the whole tone with 27, the cube
of 3, a number highly esteemed by the Pythagoreans. Philolaus divided
the whole tone in two parts, calling the lesser part of 13 units a
&lsquo;diesis&rsquo;, and the greater part of 14 units, &lsquo;apotome&rsquo;.
Philolaus had, in effect, anticipated Plato's calculations in the
Timaeus!</FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Timaeus
by Plato</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Plato (427-347 B.C.)
gave in his work Timaeus a new meaning to the Pythagorean harmonic
universe by &ndash; in a purely mathematical method &ndash; enclosing
it within the mathematically fixed limits of four octaves and a major
sixth. It was determined by the numbers forming two geometrical
progressions, of which the last term is the twenty-seventh multiple
of the first term:<BR>27 = 1+2+3+4+8+9<BR>The two geometric
progressions in which the ratios between the terms is 2:1 and 3:1
are, respectively:<BR>1-2-4-8 and 1-3-9-27. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><BR>Combining
these two progressions, Plato produced the seven-termed series:
1-2-3-4-8-9-27. The numbers in this series contain the octave, the
octave and a fifth, the double octave, the triple octave, the fifth,
the fourth and the whole tone. The entire compass from one to
twenty-seventh multiple comprises, therefore, four octaves and a
major sixth. In numerical terms it contains four octaves, 16:1 * 3:2
(a fifth) * 9:8 (a whole-tone) equals 27:1.<BR>Plato then proceeded
first to locate in each of the octaves the harmonic mean, the fourth,
then the arithmetic mean, the fifth. By inserting the harmonic and
the arithmetic means respectively between each of the terms in the
two geometric progressions, Plato formulated mathematically
everything Pythagoras had formulated by collecting acoustic data.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Plato did, however,
independently of the Pythagoreans, compute the semitone in the
fourth, which consists of two whole tones plus something, which is
less than the half of a whole tone, namely 256:243, the
leimma.<BR>According to Flora Levin in her commentary on Nicromachus'
&rdquo;The Manual of Harmonics&rdquo;, Plato went further than
Pythagoras by completing all the degrees in a diatonic scale:</FONT></FONT></P><A NAME="table3"></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The scale of Zarlino
(Just Intonation) is basically a mix of notes generated by fifths,
which allows right transpositions and notes which make correct
harmonic intervals; so in practice, two different systems are used
conjointly, which results in awkward transpositions.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
Mean Tone</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>In musical practice,
especially when playing with key-instruments or the simple modulation
of keys, the Just Intonation causes many difficulties, mainly due to
the fact of the major and minor tones. The two different intervals of
a tone in this scale was for that reason modified during the 17th
century into a mean or average of the major and minor tone. Since
these two tones together equal a major third, the mean tone is equal
to half of the major third, or 193 cents.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>This temperament is not
surprisingly called Mean Tone temperament, or 1:4 comma mean tone
(the fifths are all equal, but have been tempered by 5.5 cents, a
quarter of a syntonic comma) and was the most used temperament in
<FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">Baroque music. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>There were some problems
with the enharmonic notes. The two diatonic semitones do not add up
to give a (full) tone. The Mean Tone semitones are 117.5 cents. So if
one wishes to play in more than six major and three minor keys, there
is trouble. This is because en-harmonically equivalent notes will not
have the same frequency. Additionally, this temperament has some real
false notes, called &lsquo;wolf notes&rsquo;, due to the 3.5 cents
short fifth, so the circle will fall short of closure by 12 x 3.5

the late 17th and 18th centuries a number of circular temperaments
were employed making use of this device. It is often said that J.S.
Bach's 48 Preludes and Fugues were written to demonstrate the
effectiveness of Equal Temperament. However, recent research (Barnes
1979) has shown that he probably wrote them for a circular
temperament similar to one devised by Werckmeister (known as
Werckmeister III), where the distribution of fifths was unequal; some
were 6 cents smaller, some were perfect.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The Equal Temperament as
we know it is completely <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">equally</FONT>
distributed, slightly diminished fifths (700 cents), that at one blow
eliminates the question about different frequencies of the enharmonic
notes and modulation limitations. <BR>The octave is equally divided
into 12 semitones of 100 cents. The frequency ratio for each of the
semitones is the twelfth root of an octave: (2/1) 1/12 =
1.059463094.../1.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>This temperament has two
scales, a major and a minor. The difference lies in the third, sixth

that the same intervals are present in the minor scale as in the

tune his instrument to the keynote in the prelude, he also attunes
himself to it, and gives the audience the opportunity to do so too.
This long introduction is essential since the musicians have to tune
in to the &lsquo;sadja&rsquo;, the everlasting, never-ceasing tone.
According to Indian tradition it stands for primordial vibration,
which is called &lsquo;nada&rsquo; and expresses the universal OM.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The OM sound, according
to Cousto, corresponds approximately to the C sharp in the small
octave of the present day tuning system (136 Hz), and to the 32nd
octave tone of the Earth year. It means that in lowering 136 Hz tone
by 32 octaves, the resulting frequency will be as slow as the amount
of time it takes the Earth to circle the sun.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>It is interesting to
note that the Indians arrived at this tone, which we can calculate
mathematically, &lsquo;simply&rsquo; through intuition and
meditation.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(The
calculation is: A day consists of 86,400 seconds. A tropical year has
365,242 days = 31,556,925,9747 seconds. The reciprocal value
multiplied by 232 = 136,10221 Hz.)<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Concert

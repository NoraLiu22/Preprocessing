   There are fine exponents in every field, and within the musical realm
are  many sub-categories, each of which has its own list.&nbsp; Let me say
right  here and now that as a general rule, I find rankings</big><big> &#8212;
</big><big>  and people who constantly insist on them</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>a
hideous  detraction and a huge waste of time.&nbsp; That being said, one
cannot fail  to think that among those who write, doing so for a highly respected
publication  in a major market carries with it a certain weight of prominence,
as do scholarly  journals.&nbsp; Likewise, books seem to fall into categories
that assign  credibility and honor, depending on their authority and status.<br>
   <br>
   Knowing all this, there must be a special place for the overseer of the 
largest and most-respected encyclopedia of music in the English language.&nbsp; 
Stanley Sadie, editor of <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Grove Dictionary
of Music and Musicians</span> is that person.&nbsp; His name is inscribed
on the spine of each volume, and upon him is heaped all the praise and glory
that goes with this towering achievement.<br>
   <br>
   Before doing this gargantuan task, he was a critic for <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Times</span> of London, as well as author
 of several books about well-known subjects</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>including
 Handel, Mozart, and Beethoven.&nbsp; I mention this to indicate that doing
 the only book on an unknown composer is great in its own right, but to do
 so when there are stacks of volumes already in and out of print puts a lot
 of obligation on anyone who attempts to add to a well-traveled road.<br>
   <br>
   There was a convention of music critics in Chicago in October of 1992, 
and Sadie was here to attend.&nbsp; He graciously took time from a very busy
 schedule to speak with me at his hotel, and what you are about to read is
 that enlightening chat.&nbsp; <br>
   <br>
   Being a critic for many years before accepting the mantle of historian, 
we talked a bit about the ins and outs of that particular area.&nbsp; We then
went on to his work of re-making the primary encyclopedia of music in the
 English language.&nbsp; That, and the four other sibling compilations remain
at the forefront of musical scholarship.&nbsp; Indeed, later you will be
able to see exactly where he was in the process at the time we met.<br>
   <br>
   He was always straight-forward with his responses and thorough in sharing
 his ideas.&nbsp; Here is that conversation . . . . .<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bruce Duffie</span>:&nbsp; Thank you
for  seeing me.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stanley Sadie</span>:&nbsp; Oh, that&#8217;s 
a pleasure.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#8217;re in 
town for the Critic&#8217;s Convention?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For a bit 
of it, yes.&nbsp; I&#8217;m taking part in the panel tomorrow morning, but unfortunately
 I&#8217;m not staying right through.&nbsp; It can&#8217;t be helped; I&#8217;ve got to be
back.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you like
 being a music critic?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, I
spent  quite a long time being a music critic for <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Times</span> in London, you know.&nbsp;
I was on the staff for seventeen years.&nbsp; And yes, I love being a critic!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you prefer
 being critic to musicologist and scholar?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I try not 
to see the activities as two different areas.&nbsp; I think one can bring 
scholarship to criticism, and one can bring critical attitudes to scholarship.&nbsp;
 I think that&#8217;s a healthy mix.&nbsp; I have to feel that way, don&#8217;t I, to
justify myself?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[Laughs]&nbsp;
 Perhaps...<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I do feel 
that way.&nbsp; I think there should be evaluative thinking, critical thinking,
 in scholarship.&nbsp; And the more scholarship there is behind criticism, 
 the stronger it is.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps
here  in America we equate criticism with opinion.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, I know.&nbsp;
 That&#8217;s true to some extent in England, too, but there&#8217;s been quite a substantial
 group of critics with a scholarly background in England.&nbsp; Andrew Porter
 is a friend and colleague of mine for many years, of course.&nbsp; You know
 his kinds of work.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sure.&nbsp;
 [See my <a href="http://www.bruceduffie.com/porter.html">Interview with
Andrew  Porter</a>.]<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And there&#8217;ve
 been others</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>his colleague Nick Kenyon; Jeremy Noble,
 who is my predecessor on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Times</span>
 who ended up teaching over here in New York State as a musicologist; my
former  colleague on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Times</span>,
William Mann; Martin Cooper.&nbsp; These are people who write serious, scholarly
books and criticism.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not quite the same tradition here, I know,
but that&#8217;s understandable; it&#8217;s a different kind of world.&nbsp; London and
New York create their own kind, and your other cities here create different
kinds of ambience for people to work in.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should there
 be a different slant from someone who writes for a daily newspaper, as opposed
 to a weekly or a monthly or a scholarly journal?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="sadie3.jpg" title=""

 vspace="35" align="right">
  SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking as a critic, you mean?&nbsp; Every 
critic is always thinking, </big><big>&#8220;</big><big>Who is reading this?&nbsp; 
When are they reading it?&nbsp; What are they doing when they&#8217;re reading it?&nbsp;
 What are they wanting from me?</big><big>&#8221;</big><big>&nbsp; It&#8217;s a job.&nbsp;
 You have to satisfy your readers.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t, you won&#8217;t be doing
it much longer!&nbsp; So, you have to think about that all the time.&nbsp;
 Yes, I think there is something different.&nbsp; In England &#8212; I know more
 about English circumstances than American, of course</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>if
 you&#8217;re a Sunday critic, you, as it were, take a deep breath before you write
 your piece.&nbsp; You think back over a few events and you maybe frame a
story around several things with the emphases you want.&nbsp; You may be
trying to get something a little deeper than just commenting on events.&nbsp;
But if you are a daily critic and you are writing about one event at a time, 
 then really your job is partly reporting, partly criticism, partly placing
 of the artist or the music.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You mean 
you have to take your reading audience into consideration?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think
you  have to know who you are writing for.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re lucky, yes, I
think  you do, actually.&nbsp; You&#8217;re thinking of the kinds of people who
are going  to read your words and how they&#8217;ll react.&nbsp; You&#8217;re trying
all the time  to refine their taste.&nbsp; A critic is a professional listener,
isn&#8217;t he, really</big><big> &#8212; s</big><big>omeone who should be listening
with more  expertise than anyone else?&nbsp; The primary object of a critic,
really,  is to try and open new worlds for his reader.&nbsp; That sounds
a bit sort  of pretentious, but I think you should always be trying to open
up people&#8217;s  ears to make them more aware of things and give them a little
depth to their  listening.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They&#8217;re
reading  your words.&nbsp; Are they looking directly into your mind, or are
they also  looking through your heart?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, [laughs]
 that&#8217;s always the metaphysical question, making the distinction between
the  mind and the heart.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a bit of each.&nbsp; I think if you don&#8217;t
show you&#8217;ve got a heart, they won&#8217;t bother to read you, actually.&nbsp; But
it&#8217;s all controlled by your intellect, ultimately.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very important
to let enthusiasm, or the opposite, show through from time to time!&nbsp;
I think it&#8217;s very important.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your readers have got to know you.&nbsp;
 They may not want to identify with your taste, but they&#8217;ve got to know what
 sort of person you are</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>if you&#8217;re a critic</big><big>
 &#8212; </big><big>and what basis you&#8217;re speaking from; what preconceptions you
 have, what you dislike, what music does turn you on and what kinds of performance 
 turn you on.&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s very important and they can get a picture
 of you through that.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve got to know that you&#8217;re a live person
who actually responds to music, or they won&#8217;t find you very interesting,
probably.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#8217;s look
 at it from the negative.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t usually like to do negative, but
without  naming names or pieces or anything, if there&#8217;s a piece or a performer
that  you don&#8217;t like, is it partly your job to try and drive that composer
or performer  off the stage?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, I don&#8217;t
 think as much as that.&nbsp; This is a very big and difficult question about
 the responsibility of the critic.&nbsp; If it&#8217;s a matter of incompetence
or charlatanry, perhaps it is a matter.&nbsp; It is your job to expose it
for what you really believe it is.&nbsp; If it&#8217;s that your taste doesn&#8217;t
coincide because you think somebody&#8217;s interpretation is misguided, that&#8217;s
something different.&nbsp; That&#8217;s opinion.&nbsp; I think there&#8217;s a distinction
 there.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And you
always  try to make that distinction?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think
you  automatically make that distinction without being conscious of it.&nbsp;
You can say you dislike something, but that&#8217;s not the same as saying it&#8217;s
incompetence.&nbsp; Saying it&#8217;s incompetence is another thing and you have
to do that from time to time.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have there
 been times when you&#8217;ve been to a performance which you feel is incompetent,
 and yet it is applauded and cheered to the hilt?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, yes, 
that happens to you.&nbsp; I remember when I was a very young critic, when 
I was first writing in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Times</span>, 
I went to a piano recital at the Wigmore Hall, wh</big><big>ich is where most
of the debutantes make their bow in London.&nbsp; There was this very young
Swiss man &#8212; I can remember his name, but I wouldn&#8217;t dream of saying it</big><big>
&#8212; a</big><big>nd I said to a colleague afterwards I thought it was really
terrible; almost better not to write at all than write the kind of review
one had to write.&nbsp; He took a different view, which was all right, but
actually he went home and decided that he wouldn&#8217;t write the review.&nbsp;
I was left holding the baby!&nbsp; So I wrote a review and it was very unfavorable</big><big>
&#8212; p</big><big>erhaps justly.&nbsp; The man didn&#8217;t have the technique or any
kind of interpretive insight.&nbsp; There was a telephone call from his mother
to the office the next morning, saying, &#8220;Your critic is driving my son to
suicide!&#8221;&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t commit suicide as far as I know, but it was sort
of distressing, actually.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Has he had
 no career, or a mediocre career?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never
 seen his name again.&nbsp; But then he wasn&#8217;t in residence in London, so
I wouldn&#8217;t expect to, necessarily.&nbsp; He might work, but he never wants
to come back to London again.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But you
would  know if he was making a career in Europe or in the States.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, he&#8217;s 
never had any further career.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never heard of any further career.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What advice
 do you have for performers if they are reading criticism?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember 
that you&#8217;re dealing with one person&#8217;s view, and don&#8217;t be put off by it.&nbsp;
 Be yourself by it.&nbsp; You may learn, actually.&nbsp; I have often had
letters from people saying, &#8220;Thank you for these useful remarks.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll
take them to heart.&#8221;&nbsp; There have been other letters, too, saying, &#8220;You
got that wrong.&#8221;&nbsp; [Laughs]&nbsp; And sometimes I have; sometimes I haven&#8217;t,
 but there have been a number of letters, or people who have come up to me,
 or have said to friends that they find things useful.&nbsp; I think they
can learn if I can say something or make them think about something a bit
differently, or say something particularly in my own area of expertise.&nbsp;
Then I think a critic can be quite useful to a performer.&nbsp; But the critic&#8217;s
function absolutely is not to help the performer!&nbsp; The critic is speaking
as a member of the public.&nbsp; His responsibility is first to the music,
second to his public.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And then 
lastly to the performer?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hardly to 
the performer at all.&nbsp; The performer is out there on his own.&nbsp; He&#8217;s
got what he thinks about that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not my job!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What advice
 do you have for the public that goes to concerts and then reads the review
 in the paper the next day, or in the magazine the next week?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, again,
 same advice, really.&nbsp; Remember that you&#8217;re talking of one man&#8217;s opinion.&nbsp;
 It&#8217;s written in black and white; the words aren&#8217;t engraved in stone.&nbsp;
 And you know, the newspaper is perhaps used for wrapping up the rubbish
the  next day!&nbsp; [Both laugh]&nbsp; We&#8217;ve all seen our notices around
rotting  cabbages, or fish and chips.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That can&#8217;t
 give you a good feeling.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It reminds
 you of the ephemerality of things!&nbsp; I&#8217;d been doing it a long time</big><big>
 &#8212; seventeen years, in fact</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>and it was about then
that I began to feel I didn&#8217;t particularly want to do it much more.&nbsp;
I still enjoy writing when I do write.&nbsp; I do it very little nowadays;
I did a bit for periodicals, for monthlies and so on, when I left <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Times</span>.&nbsp; I still quite enjoy
doing it, and get a bit frustrated when I go to an event and don&#8217;t have a
chance to write a criticism!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Really?&nbsp;
 I would think it would be easier to go and not have to put into words your
 feelings.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, yes, 
if you want to be responsible.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t matter if you go to sleep 
in a boring one, just as it doesn&#8217;t matter if you let your attention wander.&nbsp;
 You don&#8217;t have to be asking yourself, &#8220;What am I thinking about?&nbsp; What
 am I going to remember of this?&nbsp; What am I going to note down on scraps
 of paper or the back of a program?&#8221;&nbsp; It&#8217;s, of course, much more relaxed,
 but on the other hand, you don&#8217;t get the chance to say, to be stimulated
into formulating your ideas, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a good thing for me.&nbsp;
I don</big><big>&#8217;t know how it is for you.</big><small><br>
   </small><big><br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do very 
little written criticism.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just on the radio.&nbsp; I play the music 
and  promote concerts and I&#8217;m glad to interview performers and give them a
chance to speak.&nbsp; But when I go to a concert, I don&#8217;t have to worry about
gathering my ideas.&nbsp; I can just relax and let the music wash over me.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, yes!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I usually 
find something good.&nbsp; Even if I don&#8217;t care for the performance, I can 
say, &#8220;Oh, I liked that bassoon solo in the middle.&#8221;<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, that&#8217;s
 good!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you find
 it particularly easy or difficult to go to a performance where you know
in  advance it&#8217;s going to be spectacular?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Actually, 
one of the things about writing criticism is it&#8217;s much harder to write a favorable
review than to write an unfavorable one.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if this is true
of other languages, but it&#8217;s certainly true that English is very much richer
in words of invective than in words of praise.&nbsp; There are all kinds
of things you can say when you&#8217;re being severely critical, and very many
fewer adjectives of praise.&nbsp; It&#8217;s always harder to go to a glamorous
event or good event.&nbsp; Sometimes the event is such that you take off
and you don&#8217;t stop and think, and the words do come.&nbsp; It can inspire
you in some sense.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I just wondered
 if your mindset would be different if you know this is a performer you have
 enjoyed for years and years and years, playing with a first-rate orchestra
 and a conductor that knows what he&#8217;s doing in a hall that&#8217;s acoustically 
rich.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, there
 are those occasions that you enjoy, and you relish them.&nbsp; Of course
it&#8217;s fun; it&#8217;s tremendous.&nbsp; I was one of a team of critics on <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Times</span>, and the critic senior to me
 used to choose the events he wanted, and I more or less had the pick of
the  rest.&nbsp; And sometimes we would say, &#8220;You might as well go to this
one  and let me do that one.&#8221;&nbsp; We shared out the glamorous ones fairly
much,  so I did get to quite a lot of exciting things like the Vienna Philharmonic
 and big, exciting works that gave great interpretation.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it part
 of your responsibility just to keep up with things, to go to concerts that
 you&#8217;re not reviewing, so that perhaps the following season, when you are
reviewing it, you will be up to date?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my early
 days as a critic, I used to use most of my nights off for going to concerts,
 yes.&nbsp; Quite often I did.&nbsp; When you&#8217;re working five nights a week
 and you usually use one of the other nights, you don&#8217;t get much home life</big><big>
 &#8212; n</big><big>ot at night time, anyway! <br>

   <big><br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you 
done any teaching?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, not
really  teaching.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been writing and editing, editing journals and
editing  big books and things.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve done bits of teaching, but not
much.&nbsp;  I taught at the Conservatory for a while.&nbsp; I taught music
history there.&nbsp;  I&#8217;ve done odds and ends of lecturing, but I&#8217;m not really
a teacher.<br>

  BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You don&#8217;t view your writings as teaching the 
 public?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh yes,
there&#8217;s  certainly an element of that in it.&nbsp; There&#8217;s bound to be a
didactic element in any writing, any worthwhile writing, yes.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have we
got  too many professional musicians these days?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#8217;s
a lot of people being trained as professional musicians who aren&#8217;t ever going 
to make a living at it.&nbsp; I think perhaps the conservatories are over-producing, 
 slightly.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know how it is here; that&#8217;s possibly the case in
 London.&nbsp; There has been some paring down of the size of the conservatories,
 which have grown rather big and a bit unwieldy.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re producing
 too many second-raters or third-raters.&nbsp; But of course there&#8217;s always
 been some lesser-lights, because there are people who aren&#8217;t ever going
to  be good performers but are still great lovers of music and are important
in teaching a new generation.&nbsp; Music teachers trained at conservatories
 are fulfilling a very important role in society.&nbsp; They&#8217;re keeping traditions
 going and keeping musical things alive.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Has the
musical  tradition been kept up over the span of time that you&#8217;ve been attending
concerts?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, it
has  really.&nbsp; There have been changes.&nbsp; There are changes currently
in London.&nbsp; Now there&#8217;s much less careful, thoughtful criticism going
on, day by day, in London newspapers and I think this is always a bad thing.&nbsp; 
 Criticism is actually a healthy activity, in that it keeps music at the front
of people&#8217;s minds.&nbsp; It keeps standards up, to some extent.&nbsp; The
times when music criticism has not been around, performing standards have
tended to go down.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because
they&#8217;re  not getting the nudging they need from outside?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Because
people  who aren&#8217;t competent feel they can get away with performing in public,
and  there&#8217;s no check on them, no one to say that they&#8217;re incompetent, publicly.&nbsp;
 I think that professionalism has a place in pointing out who such people
are.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You mean 
they fool the public?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I think
 that tends to happen a bit.&nbsp; When criticism is at a low ebb, you do
tend to get a lot of amateurish performance.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are there 
perhaps too many critics around these days?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I don&#8217;t
 know that there are.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure about that.&nbsp; The situation
is  different in each city, in each culture.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know how it is
here  in Chicago.&nbsp; You have two important daily newspapers, don&#8217;t you?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We used
to  have four, and I used to run around to the vending machines and get four
different papers, and sometimes read four very divergent reviews!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, of
course  that&#8217;s a favorite sport.&nbsp; There used to be a manager of the
central hall in London &#8212; the Royal Festival Hall &#8212; who used to print, on
the back of each month&#8217;s brochures, contradictory remarks by London music
critics.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attributed,
 or not?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Attributed,
 yes.&nbsp; It used to infuriate us, of course, and make us look silly!&nbsp;
 But actually, what he was really doing was underlining the value of criticism,
 that individuals can react very differently to the same thing, and that
one  man&#8217;s meat may be another man&#8217;s poison.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And reminding
 the public that they can enjoy something even if the critic says it&#8217;s no
good?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah.<br>

   <big><br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#8217;s talk
 a bit about your pet project, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span>.&nbsp;
 You became the Editor in 1970?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#8217;s right.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was this 
before or after the decision had been made to revamp it and bring a whole 
new scope to it?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The English
 firm that publishes it is not the same as the American firm.&nbsp; The English
 firm always had felt that there was scope for a different kind of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> from the traditional one, a tradition
 that had begun with Sir George Grove himself and had gone on up to eight
volumes in the 1954 edition.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember
 the nine volumes (including the appendix) that were sitting there for years
 and years as I was growing up!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, that&#8217;s
 right.&nbsp; The 1954 edition has a lot to be said for it, but it&#8217;s not
written  by teams of professional scholars, and it&#8217;s very much predominantly
English  in its authorship.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is
not  to say it was put together haphazardly, is it?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, not
at  all haphazardly.&nbsp; Well actually, in some respects, yes, a little
haphazardly.&nbsp;  I could go into that a good deal!&nbsp; But it wasn&#8217;t
put together with the  kind of advisory team of scholars that you really
need, and that became more  and more necessary as time went on.&nbsp; By
the time we started the Sixth  Edition of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> in 1970, it was  very clear that
it couldn&#8217;t be done by one man in the way that Eric Blom had done it, or
George Grove had done.&nbsp; I needed to have a team of people  working with
me, advising specialists.&nbsp; I had a medievalist, I had a  couple of Renaissance
scholars, experts in instruments, experts on musical  bibliographical matters,
and so on, all advising on the coverage of these  areas.&nbsp; I developed
a kind of an overview of the whole thing and discussed  details with them,
and worked out ways of covering each area.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So you immediately
 hit upon the decision to make it a whole new kind of thing?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose.&nbsp;
 The decisions are, you know, like chicken and eggs.&nbsp; The Group Director
 in charge of it went to talk to a number of people to see what ideas they
 had about how it might be done.&nbsp; They found that my ideas on it coincided
 with the kind of general view that they took</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>that
 it should be not primarily British, but certainly Anglo-American; using
the  English speaking world as its principal authors, and of course plenty
of writers from Germany and France and Spain and elsewhere, too &#8212; indeed,
all parts of the world.&nbsp; That was very much my own idea, making it much
more international in scope in its actual coverage and in its authorship.&nbsp;
I think that was acutely necessary.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not going to get a proper
coverage of Polish music, for example, without going to Polish authors in
Poland.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At what
point  was it decided not to just expand and revise the old thing, but essentially
 to scrap it and make a new thing, and see what shape it would take as it
evolved?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   </big>   
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="sadiegr2.jpg" title=""

   </div>
   <big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
   <br>
   SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was always inherent in my agreeing to
 be the editor, that I would have a free hand to use anything I wanted to
use.&nbsp; My rule of thumb was simply if I could get something better, I
would.&nbsp; If I felt that an article in the Fifth Edition was of a very
high quality and there was no one who could actually do it better, then we
would simply reprint it.&nbsp; We did reprint a number of articles, for example,
by Professor Gerald Abraham, the very distinguished student of Russian music
who did most of the entries on Russian composers.&nbsp; He also wrote on
Schumann; we retained that article, though we did a good deal of updating
there because a lot of research had been done, and we had to have a new list
of works and a new bibliography.&nbsp; But broadly speaking, we said, &#8220;Is
this article the best that we can do?&nbsp; If not, let&#8217;s re-commission it.&#8221;<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Somewhere 
I saw that you had said about three percent of the Fifth Edition found its
 way into the Sixth.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was of 
that order.&nbsp; I never worked this out; that was a figure I made up one 
day when I was trying to do a quick, spot calculation, and it&#8217;s become gospel
 since!&nbsp; [Laughs]&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s true, but I think
it&#8217;s  about right; it can&#8217;t be very far off.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you 
started out, did you know it was going to be twenty volumes, or did you just 
know it was going to be some kind of mammoth undertaking?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We knew
it  was going to be big.&nbsp; We said initially, &#8220;Let&#8217;s aim for twelve biggish
 volumes.&#8221;&nbsp; It was very soon after that it was going to be fourteen
volumes,  and then it grew, as these projects do.&nbsp; You know what happened
with  Sir George Groves&#8217;s own dictionary, don&#8217;t you?&nbsp; When the first
volume  appears &#8212; it appears in separate volumes, actually, in fascicles</big><big>
 &#8212; </big><big>it says on the title page, &#8220;A Dictionary of Music in Two Volumes.&#8221;&nbsp;
 When Volume Two appears, it says, &#8220;A Dictionary of Music in Three Volumes.&#8221;&nbsp;
 And when the third volume appears, it says, &#8220;In Four Volumes.&#8221;&nbsp; That
 time it was right!&nbsp; So these projects do tend to grow, and that&#8217;s indeed 
 happened, particularly with our most recent one.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t mind <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> growing.&nbsp; We had to keep it
 to a reasonable size, but it did need to be twenty volumes.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why twenty?&nbsp;
 Why not twenty-four?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, that&#8217;s
 a very good question, but quite a difficult one to answer.&nbsp; But there
 is an answer to it.&nbsp; If we&#8217;d made it twenty-four volumes, then it would
 have gone into a good deal more detail than is broadly necessary for a non-specialist 
 dictionary.&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s the right answer to that question.&nbsp;
 I think if we were doing it now and we were actually adding to it &#8212; and
of  course that&#8217;s something we are considering at some stage &#8212; we might want
to make it another two volumes, another three or four volumes, because a
lot&#8217;s happened since.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been research on material already there,
and in new music.&nbsp; But there might be other ways of changing the shape.&nbsp;
 I don&#8217;t know.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now you
say  </big><big>&#8220;</big><big>for the non-specialist.</big><big>&#8221;</big><big>&nbsp; 
 At whom is the twenty volume <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> 
 aimed?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean the 
 library user, the person who wants a certain level of information that he
 can get from a dictionary of music, as opposed to going to specialist books</big><big>
 &#8212; </big><big>which are very likely in other languages</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>or 
 periodical articles, and so on.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what I was really meaning by
 the non-specialist.&nbsp; The specialist will use our bibliographies first
 to find his way to those specialist articles in the periodical literature,
 the festival literature, the congress report literature, and so on, which
 is not generally available except in big libraries and is awkward to use,
 very often in foreign languages and not broadly accessible.&nbsp; So we
felt  that that size was right for a dictionary that needs to be accessible
to the ordinary reader.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So in no 
section of the dictionary is it all you&#8217;d ever want to know about a particular 
topic or subject?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t
 say that that&#8217;s necessarily entirely so!&nbsp; I think there are probably
 a few things that have got all you want &#8212; and maybe several, quite all you
 want, and a bit more!&nbsp; [Both laugh]&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know!&nbsp; It&#8217;s
very  difficult now, when you&#8217;re doing this.&nbsp; When you&#8217;re preparing
it, you  never know quite what you&#8217;re going to use.&nbsp; For instance, there&#8217;s
a marvelous article on Indian music.&nbsp; To the specialist on Indian music,
that&#8217;s going to be insufficient.&nbsp; To you and me, it&#8217;s probably going
to be rather more than you want to know.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a very big article.&nbsp;
It&#8217;s a marvelous article, written by Harold Powers of Princeton.&nbsp; It&#8217;s
 very detailed and very elaborate.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So you write
 essentially, then, for the musical scholar, but not necessarily in their
topic.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least 
you&#8217;ve got to be up to date for the person in that topic.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got 
to take in the literature search, so that a student of Indian music will get
a good picture from that.&nbsp; But he also wants to look at the bibliography 
and follow up.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll read a sentence written by Powers and say, &#8220;I wonder
where that idea comes from.&#8221;&nbsp; He wants to go to the bibliography; he
wants to go deeper into it and see if he takes the same view as Powers of
a particular thing.&nbsp; That&#8217;s some discussion.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if I&#8217;m 
a specialist in something and someone says, &#8220;What do you do?&#8221; I could say,
 &#8220;Read the article in <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> about 
 this specialty and it will tell you essentially what I do and what I&#8217;ve learned.&#8221;<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, that&#8217;s
 right.&nbsp; Take again, as an example, Indian music.&nbsp; The article
is  the biggest I read in the dictionary; it&#8217;s quite big, yet it&#8217;s within
the  scope of the dictionary.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no detailed discussion of any
single  work.&nbsp; If you want to read a bit about the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Jupiter Symphony</span> or find a couple of
sentences about citterns or a few paragraphs in which a late symphonist is
 discussed, fine.&nbsp; But if you want to read in more detail about the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Jupiter Symphony</span> and its background,
then you&#8217;d want to read a specialist like J.N. David, or maybe a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">festschrift</span> analyzing one of its movements.&nbsp;
 And that we would expect to lead you to from the bibliography.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So there&#8217;s
 an explanation, but no real analysis?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wouldn&#8217;t
 be just twenty volumes, it would be two hundred if there was real analysis!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Would you 
have turned it down if they had said, &#8220;We want an exhaustive study of everything.&nbsp;
 Make it five hundred volumes and that&#8217;ll be it&#8221;?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, it 
couldn&#8217;t have been done in my lifetime!&nbsp; It can&#8217;t be done.&nbsp; It really
can&#8217;t because to do these jobs thoroughly takes slow and elaborate work.&nbsp;
With this opera dictionary, we&#8217;ve taken about a year longer at it.&nbsp;
And we&#8217;ve done, actually, something slightly more elaborate on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Opera Dictionary</span> than we did on <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> itself, in the sense that we&#8217;ve
tried to check, in more detail, every fact in it.&nbsp; Opera, as a subject,
is a more self-contained one than the whole of the world&#8217;s music, such as
<span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> has, so this enables you to
 be a little bit more precise, and to build in a lateral element as well
as a vertical element.&nbsp; A dictionary, like <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span>, is made up of articles written
 on particular topics.&nbsp; If you imagine those as a series of vertical
strands, you don&#8217;t get many cross-connections between them.&nbsp; You put
in cross-references, of course, but you cannot draw conclusions that might
come from looking in a horizontal way at those vertical constructs.&nbsp;
In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Opera Dictionary</span>, we think
we&#8217;ve got a horizontal structure as well.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I see.&nbsp;
 So then it does become a fabric.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It becomes
 a fabric.&nbsp; It becomes much more solid, and much stronger.&nbsp; And
in that sense, I think, this is the best of the dictionaries we&#8217;ve done.&nbsp;
 We&#8217;ve done two other big ones.&nbsp; We did a three-volume <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Dictionary of Instruments</span>, which tells
 a good deal on non-western as well as western instruments, and their makers
 and their use.&nbsp; And then we did a four-volume <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Dictionary of American Music</span>.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right, yes.&nbsp;
 I refer to that all the time.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#8217;m glad 
to hear it.&nbsp; Excellent!&nbsp; And then there&#8217;s a two-volume <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Jazz Dictionary</span>.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t involved
 in that myself, except in a sort of general advisory capacity.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am curious
 why the <span style="font-style: italic;">American</span> was made a different 
 size.&nbsp; The twenty volumes of <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> 
 are very nice, but then I have these four larger size volumes.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, that&#8217;s
 right.&nbsp; That&#8217;s because, generally speaking, Americans like to have
larger  books!&nbsp; [Both laugh]&nbsp; So we used a larger format.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would
have  thought it would have looked nice to be twenty-four of the same size
along  the shelf.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It would 
be nice, yes.&nbsp; It would be nice to have them all exactly uniform in some
ways.&nbsp; The opera dictionary is also slightly larger in format, which
gives it a slightly different scope of illustration, which is very important
in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Opera Dictionary</span>.&nbsp; It&#8217;s
 slightly taller pages.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, it&#8217;s 
the size of the <span style="font-style: italic;">American</span>?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#8217;s actually
 in-between!&nbsp; It&#8217;s slightly narrower.&nbsp; [Laughs]&nbsp; Sorry, your
 shelves aren&#8217;t going to be tidy!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I don&#8217;t
 care about them being tidy, but once in a while it&#8217;s nice to just look at 
 something as a set.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, yes, 
it would be.&nbsp; Actually, what you do when you&#8217;re planning one of these 
things is say, &#8220;What is right for this dictionary?&#8221;&nbsp; That&#8217;s the way we&#8217;ve
done it.&nbsp; We chose a different typography in the opera one as we did
for the American one.&nbsp; The American one has a slightly more ornamental 
typography.&nbsp; It&#8217;s set in a typeface called Garamond, which is a historic 
one, whereas the twenty volume dictionary and the instrument dictionary were 
set in Times Roman, which is a very standard, simply legible, quite condensed 
type, actually.&nbsp; The way it&#8217;s structured, you get more words per page 
in Times than in almost  anything else.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s good for conveying 
information in a very dense kind of way.&nbsp; For opera, we&#8217;ve got a slightly 
different look, again.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s slightly more elegant.&nbsp; Operas, 
after all, are rather elegant kinds of arts, and we thought we wanted to match
something to it, rather than the slightly humdrum Times type.<br>

much of it is completely new?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A very large
 proportion is completely new.&nbsp; For a start, there are articles on individual
 operas, nearly two thousand operas &#8212; some very short, some extremely long</big><big>
 &#8212; a</big><big>nd all this is freshly commissioned!&nbsp; There are some
new  articles on composers</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>about two thousand or
three  thousand composers; I can&#8217;t give you an exact figure at the moment.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have you 
tried to cover everything in opera, or was any thought given to taste</big><big> 
 &#8212; </big><big>that certain operas nobody likes, so we won&#8217;t include them?&nbsp;
 They&#8217;re never done, so why put them in?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If they&#8217;re
 historically important, we&#8217;ve put them in.&nbsp; You might say, for example,
 that the operas of Massenet are a slightly exotic taste.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve given
 a very thorough coverage to Massenet&#8217;s operas.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got a very good
 and sympathetic coverage, beautifully written by Rodney Milnes, the Editor
 of <span style="font-style: italic;">Opera</span> Magazine in London.&nbsp;
 And as I read these articles, I ached to hear these works!&nbsp; That&#8217;s
what  I like, really, being tempted to hear them.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never said,
&#8220;This  is a bad opera.&nbsp; We won&#8217;t write on it.&#8221;&nbsp; If you count the
repertory  of operas, there must be fifty thousand operas composed.&nbsp;
So you have  to be discriminating and we think we&#8217;ve chosen a good selection.&nbsp;
We&#8217;ve  let our advisors in each area help us.&nbsp; We have, for example,
a lady  working in Virginia who was our chief advisor on Italian opera of
the late  eighteenth century.&nbsp; She&#8217;s got a wonderful grasp of what was
new in Italian opera at this period, and she suggested little entries on
a number of operas by Jommelli, Bianchi, Andreozzi &#8212; not exactly composers
who you hear at the Lyric Opera of Chicago every night!<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know an 
overture by Jommelli, and that&#8217;s about it of those three.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jommelli&#8217;s
 a very interesting figure, actually; a very important figure.&nbsp; It&#8217;s
a very long article on him in general; he&#8217;s a very serious important figure.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you hope
 that some of this will then translate into performances of their works?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, I do!&nbsp;
 Yes, of course I do!&nbsp; You read about this Bianchi opera which was the 
 first opera to do this or that or the other and to make various departures
 in style.&nbsp; Operas of historic importance, for one reason or another,
 that&#8217;s described, and the reason of their historic importance is described,
 too.&nbsp; For most of our articles on operas, we gave the plot &#8212; sometimes
 just a thumbnail sketch of it, sometimes a fairly full account</big><big>
 &#8212; a</big><big>nd we may certainly discuss the music and give a little bit
 of background about when and where they were performed.&nbsp; And if they
 were important, we have a little bit about the background history of them
 and their composition.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you
pleased  with the way it&#8217;s turning out?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#8217;s been 
a very exciting dictionary to work on.&nbsp; There are days when you look 
at it and think, &#8220;This is thrilling.&#8221;&nbsp; There are other days when you 
think, &#8220;Oh, God, I wish had done this slightly differently, or better.&#8221;&nbsp; 
But yes, we&#8217;re very pleased, actually.&nbsp; We&#8217;re very excited by it.&nbsp;
 As I say, I do think it&#8217;s the best dictionary we&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; One of the
 things we woven into it is a lot of discussion of librettos and librettists.&nbsp; 
 The literary element of operas is very, very important; in some areas it
 is considered much more important than the music.&nbsp; In the eighteenth
 century, when you went to the opera house, you&#8217;d know the librettist name,
 but you might not even be told the name of the composer!&nbsp; You bought
 your program, your little libretto, in the theater as you went in.&nbsp;
Librettos are very important in giving shape to the work and giving definition
to it, especially in an age when musical idioms are as uniform as that.&nbsp;
So we&#8217;ve given a lot of attention to librettos and to the articles on librettists.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Has there 
been any attention given to the dissemination of recordings and videos of 
operas?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We haven&#8217;t
 listed discographies or anything like this because always, if you try and
 do a discography, it&#8217;s out of date before you&#8217;ve got it in print.&nbsp;
There  are other works that specialize in this area that we wouldn&#8217;t wish
and shouldn&#8217;t  try to compete with.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve certainly mentioned, in many
articles, the  existence of recordings; there are many articles on singers
and conductors  where recordings are often cited as enshrining their arts
in particular.&nbsp;  &#8220;Their outstanding recording of so and so,&#8221; that kind
of thing.&nbsp; There&#8217;s  an article on the recording of opera, and there&#8217;s
an article on the filming  and videotaping of opera that&#8217;s actually written
by Brian Large, who is responsible  for all the Met broadcasts.&nbsp; He&#8217;s
an old friend, an old colleague.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you&#8217;ve 
gone to the right sources in every instance, as much as you can?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We try to 
follow the old <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> rule</big><big> 
&#8212; </big><big>you get to the best person.<br>
   <br>
   </big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 So the <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove Dictionary of Opera</span> 
 is about to come out.&nbsp; How long has the twenty-volume <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> been available?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Twelve years.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking
at  it from a distance of twelve years, are you still pleased?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Broadly, 
yes.&nbsp; I can see things that in the light of changing circumstances I 
could do differently.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not saying that there&#8217;s some articles in it
that aren&#8217;t as good as some of the other articles.&nbsp; If I were advising 
a further edition, I would want to consider what I would be re-commissioning, 
what I would want to commission afresh, what I wouldn&#8217;t, and in what subject 
areas it might need a good deal of overhauling, and in what subject areas 
it&#8217;s still pretty well up to date.<br>

  BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Has there been any thought to adding an appendix 
 volume?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, we won&#8217;t
 ever do an appendix volume.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not a practical proposition to do
an appendix.&nbsp; The only thing we would do might be a new edition, in
due course, a revised edition. <br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Would that
 be, then, <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove Seven</span>, or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove Six and a Half</span>?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would 
be, bibliographically speaking, correct to be <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove Seven</span>, but it would be a revised
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove Six</span>.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove Four</span> was a revised <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove Three</span>; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove Two</span> was a revised <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove One</span>, actually, so there&#8217;s plenty
 of precedent for that.&nbsp; It would be quite heavily revised.&nbsp; It&#8217;s
 interesting you asked that question.&nbsp; I spoke to a man who is our chief
 advisor on the early Renaissance during much of the early preparation of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span>, and I said to him, &#8220;If you
were revising <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span>, how much would
you change?&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Oh, it would be all different,&#8221; he says.&nbsp; &#8220;We want
 to rewrite almost everything!&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Is that really so?&nbsp; Would you
like to have a look at one volume, for example, and give me a real written
report on this?&#8221;&nbsp; So I commissioned a report from him and he said, &#8220;You
know, I was exaggerating.&nbsp; Probably about sixty percent of the articles
could be reprinted as they stood with just sometimes a little correction
and sometimes a bit of extra bibliography.&nbsp; You&#8217;d probably not need
to re-commission more than fifteen percent in that area,&#8221; and I think that
goes for quite a lot of the dictionary.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I would
think  that would be a great relief to you to know that your dictionary is
standing  up so well.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.&nbsp;
 It&#8217;s very nice to know that.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very nice to know that the work
is  circumscribed if we do start on this, that there&#8217;s a certain limit to
what  we&#8217;d have to do.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I would want to go through quite
that  again</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>a ten year project!&nbsp; I may not be
quite  at a suitable time in my life for that, though I must say I would
do it if  I were asked!&nbsp; [Laughs]<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m afraid
 it&#8217;s sort of like asking a woman who&#8217;s in labor, &#8220;Will you have another
child?&#8221;  <br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#8217;d say, 
&#8220;Never again!&#8221;&nbsp; [Continues laughing]<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you&#8217;ve 
got the big <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> and you&#8217;ve got 
the four smaller ones...<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, you&#8217;ll
 find these little ones quite big, actually.&nbsp; For this opera one, we
said, &#8220;Yes, a three volume opera dictionary.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t make it more than
three modest-sized volumes to start with.&#8221;<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it turned
 out to be four large volumes.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I said initially,
 &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to contain; opera&#8217;s a big subject.&nbsp; If we&#8217;re to satisfy
 the needs of the serious scholar</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>which we&#8217;ve got 
to do</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>and satisfy the interests of the opera goer</big><big>
 &#8212; </big><big>which we certainly need to do, too</big><big> &#8212; </big><big>it&#8217;s 
 going to be very difficult to contain it in three volumes.&#8221;&nbsp; I have
 to tell you that although it&#8217;s four volumes, it contains as much as six
and  a half volumes of <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span>.<br>

   <big><br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is 
music going today?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#8217;t
know  the answer to that!&nbsp; I&#8217;m not a critic sufficiently to know the
answers  to those questions.&nbsp; What do you think?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think
it&#8217;s  growing like topsy, and we&#8217;re trying to follow all kinds of paths.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#8217;s diversifying.&nbsp;
 You can certainly say that.&nbsp; It&#8217;s certainly diversifying compared to
 when I was doing active criticism in the sixties and seventies.&nbsp; We
all felt that music was moving in particular ways.&nbsp; There were certain
trends that were clear then that have broken down now, and it relates to
much broader social conditions and circumstances, too.&nbsp; It relates to
all kinds of things, like the interest in non-western music.&nbsp; That&#8217;s
certainly the case in England; I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s perhaps even more so here.&nbsp;
There is also the absorption of popular music trends into what we call serious
or classical music, too.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you feel
 that the audience for classical music as we know it is going to continue,
 or is it dying out?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It certainly
 isn&#8217;t dying out.&nbsp; Think of the number of CD&#8217;s that are purchased every 
 day.&nbsp; The sale of serious classical gramophone recordings is as great
 as ever.&nbsp; The opera houses are full.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a great vogue for
 opera at the moment in many parts of the world.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me ask
 a philosophical question.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the purpose of music?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well that&#8217;s
 a very difficult question.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the kind of thing you want to discuss
 with a biologist, an evolutionist, and others.&nbsp; I have a friend who
has often asked me this, and he feels that music does have some collective
 significance in focusing feeling and emotion.&nbsp; What evolutionary purpose
does it have, you might ask?&nbsp; I should think there is some</big><big>
&#8212; </big><big>in welding communities together, in strengthening groups in
some sense.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re at a concert, you share a fellow feeling with
a couple of thousand other people at the concert.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something.&nbsp;
I don&#8217;t know, really, the answer.&nbsp; I think there are other things, too.&nbsp;
 <br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there 
a balance between art and entertainment in music?<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talk
of  entertainment.&nbsp; We go to things like Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&#8217;s opera <span
 style="font-style: italic;">From the House of the Dead</span>, or operas
 where everybody&#8217;s killed, or the world comes to an end, like <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</span>.&nbsp; All
these works are so deeply depressing, in some ways.&nbsp; Or we go to tragedies
 like <span style="font-style: italic;">King Lear </span>&#8212; that&#8217;s a prime 
example &#8212; and we&#8217;re entertained by it.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re talking about tragedy; 
this doesn&#8217;t make us laugh.&nbsp; </big><big>&#8220;</big><big>Entertainment</big><big>&#8221;</big><big> 
 &#8212; it&#8217;s a funny word.&nbsp; We can be entertained in a whole lot of different
 ways, and by being given this kind of spiritual sustenance that works like
 these give us, we&#8217;re entertained in some sense.&nbsp; And people use the
term </big><big>&#8220;</big><big>entertainment music</big><big>&#8221;</big><big> as
a translation of the word <span style="font-style: italic;">interhauptensmusik</span>,
to mean light music or trivial music.&nbsp; But actually, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</span> is entertaining,
 too!&nbsp; But then on the other hand, there&#8217;s no arguing either that tragic
 or serious things are more profound than comic ones, necessarily.&nbsp;
Great  operas like <span style="font-style: italic;">Figaro</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Falstaff</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Meistersinger</span>, which are partly comic
 operas, have just as profound things to say, it seems to me.<br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">BD</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you 
for coming to Chicago.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; And thank you for spending
 the time with me. <br>
   <br>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very good 
to be here.&nbsp; Thank you.<br>

 style="font-style: italic;">The Times</span><br>
   March 23, 2005<br>
   Stanley Sadie<br>
         <br>
   Musicologist whose thirst for all forms of scholarship made the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">New Grove Dictionary</span> the last word on
 music.<br>
         <br>
   A leading Mozartian scholar, Stanley Sadie was also widely  knowledgeable
 in every other branch of musical scholarship. This made him eminently suitable
 for editing T<span style="font-style: italic;">he New Grove Dictionary of
 Music and Musicians</span> from 1970. The 20 volumes eventually appeared
in 1979, delayed because of the large scope of the new edition. He was also 
 largely responsible for organising its successor in the late 1990s. The two
editions evinced an enormous increase in the size of the work, encompassing
 a vast amount of new scholarship and long articles on ethnic music. Such
was Sadie&#8217;s enthusiasm that some thought the Grove had become too unwieldy,
too eclectic.<br>
         <br>
   Yet several spin-off volumes, all edited by Sadie, meant that one could 
acquire just the sections of Grove one wanted. One of the most important of
these, with additional material, was <span style="font-style: italic;">The
New Grove  Dictionary of American Music</span> (1986). <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The New Grove Dictionary of Opera</span> (1992)
used some matter from the main Dictionary, but contained many new articles.
It remains the most authoritative of its kind, not least because of Sadie&#8217;s
thorough control of editorial policy.<br>
         <br>
   Sadie was accomplished in choosing the right author for a subject. Having
 travelled widely in musical lands, he was able to make the dictionary far
 more cosmopolitan in its style and scope than it had previously been. He
was a hands-on editor, overseeing almost every aspect of the vast work&#8217;s
myriad entries, and contributing a great deal himself in writing new and
learned articles.<br>
         <br>
   He was not unnaturally angered when one colleague invented two composers
 (actually two Danish villages hyphenated), a matter that eluded even Sadie&#8217;s
 eagle eyes, for the 1979 edition, although the incident provided some undoubted
 mirth among readers in the know. The exigencies of producing the 2001 edition
 faster than Sadie would have liked was part of the reason for his eventual
 replacement as effective editor, although he still acted in an advisory
capacity  and had assembled many fresh entries and new authors. In the end,
that most  recent edition showed all too clearly the haste in which it went
to press  and on to the internet.<br>
         <br>
   Sadie had enjoyed a busy career as a musicologist and critic before he 
was invited to edit <span style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span>. Indeed 
he was probably put in charge of the dictionary following his time as a successful
 editor of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Musical Times</span> (1967-87).
 He extended its range in terms of coverage of events, particularly as regards
 contemporary works, and a wide range of articles concerned with the fruit
 of musical research. He was president of the Royal Musical Association in
 1989.<br>
         <br>
   He became a music critic on The Times in 1964 and remained in that post 
until 1981, when his work on Grove demanded his full-time attention, although 
he occasionally found time to write notices, lengthy and well-informed, for
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">Financial Times</span>. His reviews
 always suggested a firm commitment to musical scholarship, and his views,
 usually sympathetic to the performers, were laced with a caustic wit. He
was, in sum, a fair but strict critic.<br>
         <br>
   Sadie was born in London, and attended St Paul&#8217;s School, 1942-48. He read
 music at Cambridge from 1950, studying with Charles Cudworth, Thurston Dart
 and Patrick Hadley. The first two no doubt led him to his lifelong work
on  composers of the 18th century. Indeed, having obtained an MA, he went
on to take a PhD with a dissertation on mid-18th-century British chamber
music,  He taught at the Trinity College of Music, 1957-65, before turning
to musical  journalism.<br>
         <br>
   In 1976, besides his other work, he became general editor of the authoritative
       <span style="font-style: italic;">Master Musicians</span> series of
 music biographies. He also found time to write books on Mozart (1966), Beethoven
 (1967) and Handel (1972). After he left <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Grove</span> he embarked on a book, with his
 wife Julie, on composers&#8217; houses. This will shortly be published under the
 title, <span style="font-style: italic;">Calling on the Composer: a guide
 to European composers&#8217; homes and museums</span>. This is the fruit of 12
years&#8217; labour by the partners.<br>
         <br>
   On a visit to Russia for the volume, Sadie was involved in a serious car
 crash, caused by an unruly taxi driver, that nearly brought his life to
a  premature end.<br>
         <br>
   By that time he had embarked on a large, exhaustive work on Mozart, the 
first volume of which he managed to finish and is with the printers. Mozart 
and Handel (he was the first to suggest the restoration of Handel&#8217;s London 
home as a museum) were indeed the great loves of his life, and he probably 
knew as much as any of his contemporaries about those great composers&#8217; lives 
and work, examining and re-examining source material in his typically scrupulous
 manner and writing about their work from his extensive knowledge of the
scores.<br>
         <br>
   A festschrift in Sadie&#8217;s honour, subtitled <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Words about Mozart: Essays in Honour of Stanley
 Sadie</span>, was published by Boydell and Brewer in February. Many of his
 most distinguished colleagues contributed to this celebration of his work.<br>
         <br>
   He was a lively, witty and quite didactic conversationalist, often at
his  happiest when discussing the minutiae of a score or dissecting an interpretation
 of one. Friends could be sure to have any theory tested in conversation
by  a finely honed, always inquisitive mind. He achieved an enormous amount
in  furthering the cause of musical scholarship and knowledge in an international

 His lively, witty, thoughtful attitude comes across so readily, in answer

W. Pabst’s interest in the work of playwright Frank Wedekind dated back to at least the immediate post–World War I period, when the director, then living in Prague, staged productions of Wedekind’s King Nicolo (König Nicolo) and Earth Spirit (Erdgeist). By the mid-1920s, Pabst had not only entered the world of cinema but had also secured a lofty position within the German film industry, at the time second only to that of the United States in terms of artistic excellence and international box office. </span></div> &nbsp;<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Having achieved his first success with 1925’s The Joyless Street (Die freudlose Gasse), Pabst wished to flex his muscles by adapting Wedekind, a turn-of-the-century enfant terrible whose plays had quickly become staples of the German theatrical canon. Wedekind was synonymous with controversy. Although the Hungarian filmmaker Arzén von Cserépy had already mounted a 1921 German production of Pandora’s Box (Die Büchse der Pandora), Wedekind’s most famous work, Pabst found himself rebuffed by Phoebus-Film when he suggested his own cinematic adaptation; the story of the ruinous yet childlike Lulu, the centripetal force of both Pandora’s Box and Earth Spirit, was simply too lurid for the production company to consider financing it. </span></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1"><br></span></div> &nbsp;<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Enter Seymour Nebenzahl, the New York–born, German Jewish cofounder of Nero-Film and the future producer of some of the most significant movies of the Weimar era, including People on Sunday (1930) and M (1931). In 1928, Nebenzahl took a chance on Pabst’s Pandora and, though Nero-Film typically backed midbudget productions—what the Germans call Mittelfilme—he agreed to allot extra funding to the ascendant director so that Pabst might realize his singular vision. According to scholar Pamela Hutchinson, in her 2018 BFI Film Classics monograph on Pandora’s Box, all those involved in the film attested that Nebenzahl never once told Pabst how to craft it. Pabst worked with Hungarian screenwriter Ladislaus Vajda on the film (the third of nine they would collaborate on), which combined elements of Earth Spirit and Pandora’s Box. (Wedekind originally envisioned these two plays—which chart Lulu’s rise and fall as a “kept woman” whose irresistible sexuality spells doom for many, including herself—as a single work.) However, Pabst and Vajda’s interpretation would irk German critics, who considered it scandalous. Deemed especially questionable was the jettisoning of most of Wedekind’s verbose, poetic dialogue, a decision that should have made perfect sense given that Pabst’s film is silent. Once the script was complete, Nebenzahl rounded up $75,000 for a five-week production at Staaken Studios, a zeppelin hangar turned soundstage on the outskirts of Berlin. Additional shooting took place at the EFA (Europäische Film-Allianz) Studio in Halensee, a Berlin locality. </span></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1"><br></span></div> &nbsp;<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">The casting of Pandora’s Box would generate animosity both on and off the set, focused almost exclusively on the beautiful, fast living Louise Brooks, who stars as Lulu. In what is now cinematic legend, Pabst conducted a wide-ranging search for his leading lady (one newspaper reported auditions for sixteen hundred would-be Lulus) but found not a single satisfactory candidate. After seeing her performance as an alluring, amoral circus entertainer in the Howard Hawks comedy A Girl in Every Port (1928), Pabst longed to work with Brooks, but Paramount refused to loan her out. So, when he received word that Brooks had split with the studio, he immediately contacted the actor—even as Marlene Dietrich sat in his office, on the verge of signing on to the production. The partnership was a coup for both: Brooks was looking to escape Hollywood’s stifling conventionality and brutal rumour mill, while Pabst hoped to startle audiences with a relative unknown in a role that demanded equal parts innocence, carnality, and guile. </span></div> &nbsp;<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Pabst’s unorthodox choice would ultimately make Pandora’s Box a classic, but some of Brooks’s co-stars bristled at performing alongside a second-class actor known primarily for her saucy “flapper” roles in light comedies. (It didn’t help that Brooks was the highest-paid cast member, even though she couldn’t speak German.) Fritz Kortner, who plays Dr. Schön, was especially incensed. Like many, Kortner viewed Brooks as a frivolous celebrity rather than a genuine performer, a prejudice that was further inflamed when Pabst consistently favored Brooks for close-ups. While shooting a key scene in which Dr. Schön jealously manhandles Lulu during their wedding reception, Kortner was more than a little overzealous in expressing his character’s anger, perhaps channeling authentic rage at what he perceived as Brooks-the-upstart. Describing Brooks as uninterested in the script and unwilling to study the Wedekind plays, Hutchinson claims that Pabst coached a career-defining performance out of her with individualized, scene-to-scene direction. While this method won over Brooks, the other thespians weren’t as pleased. </span></div> &nbsp;<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Despite these tensions, the production of Pandora’s Box was otherwise peaceful. Per Hutchinson: “The director kept a disciplined, quiet, and amiable set. He was always sure of the way he wanted to film a scene, but was prepared to listen to suggestions from any member of the crew, and to change his course if he thought they were right.” Essential to realizing Pabst’s visual ideas were Austrian cinematographer Günther Krampf and Russian-born art director Andrej Andrejew, both of whom helped Pabst to evoke the film’s hothouse atmosphere of lust, envy, and violence. And while Joseph Fieseler has been widely credited as the film’s editor, Hutchinson presents convincing evidence that Pabst himself was the one responsible for cutting Pandora (or else enlisted someone else to follow his instructions to the letter). As the head of New York City’s successful 55th Street Playhouse, Fieseler was more likely instituting drastic revisions to the U.S. prints of the film, which included an opening title card apologizing for its bowdlerization. Fieseler was an advocate of free speech who, two years before, had published an anthology of naughty jokes—one can imagine the pained reluctance with which he expurgated Pandora’s “sins.” </span></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs14lh1"> </span><br></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Yet this neutering of Pandora’s Box, replete with a ludicrous happy ending in which Lulu joins the Salvation Army instead of meeting her fate at the hands of Jack the Ripper, destroyed its credibility with reviewers and sabotaged its run in the American market—ironic, as one reason Brooks had been brought on board was to increase its chances there. France and the United Kingdom received their own butchered Pandoras—which, among other changes, reframed the lesbian-coded Countess Geschwitz (Alice Roberts) as Lulu’s childhood friend—and, in both countries, the film was received with incomprehension and repudiation. But even in Germany, where it was released in January 1929 in the version that Pabst intended, Pandora’s Box failed to win over critics and audiences. Though Brooks had been greeted with hosannas by the press upon her arrival in Germany—she graced the cover of no fewer than three major magazines—they turned on both her and Pabst’s dream project when they saw the finished product, taking exception to an American’s portrayal of the iconic, quintessentially German Lulu. Another point of contention was Pabst’s supposed softening of Wedekind: whereas the plays depict Lulu as an unrepentant femme fatale, Pabst sympathetically renders his heroine as a victim of her libidinal energies, misplaced within the exploitative, hypocritical world of bourgeois morality. Miraculously, Pandora’s Box underwent a major reevaluation in the 1950s, when the film was rescued from relative obscurity. At Paris’s Cinémathèque française, film historian Henri Langlois is said to have proclaimed Brooks supreme among the glamorous actresses of her time. Underappreciated in her own era, Brooks and her ineffable amalgam of naive charm and sultry recklessness seemed revelatory to the burgeoning generation of New Wave critics and filmmakers who would soon revolutionize the industry. And the movie itself stunned new audiences, who found its fervent yet naturalistic portrait of a self-immolating web of desire as forward looking as the other towering works of German expressionism’s heyday. <span class="imUl"> Film Notes courtesy of Janus Films</span></span></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1"><span class="imUl">A Review from the<a href="https://silent-volume.blogspot.com/2009/03/pandoras-box-1929.html" onclick="return x5engine.imShowBox({ media:[{type: 'iframe', url: 'https://silent-volume.blogspot.com/2009/03/pandoras-box-1929.html', width: 1920, height: 1080, description: ''}]}, 0, this);" class="imCssLink"> Silent Volume</a> Blog by Chris Edwards </span></span></div></div>

									<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><div><b class="fs12lh1">WEST OF ZANZIBAR: A HEART OF DARKNESS</b><br></div> &nbsp;<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Tod Browning’s film career spanned both the silent and sound era of films. While his best-known films were both talkies (Dracula &amp; Freaks), his output in the teens and ‘20s were his most productive. He would draw on his early life in the circus and carnival worlds in numerous films, including </span><span class="fs11lh1"><i>West of Zanzibar</i></span><span class="fs11lh1">, to bring depth and a sense of mystery tot he stories.</span><br></div><span class="fs11lh1">After leaving his wife, he “renamed” himself for his professional life from Charles to Tod---tod being the German name for death--the shape of things to come.</span><br><span class="fs11lh1">He performed in carnivals and vaudeville acts in his youth and at the relatively late age of 29 turned to film acting. But low and behold, he started out not in dramas or crime films but in comedies, starring in over 50 one or two reelers. Hired by D W Griffith at Biograph, he continued acting and left for California when Griffith did. By 1915, he had made his directorial debut (</span><span class="fs11lh1"><i>The Lucky Transfer</i></span><span class="fs11lh1">).</span><br><span class="fs11lh1">Then a crucial turning point in his life occurred. While drunk, he drove his car through a railway crossing and hit a train. He was gravely injured as was his passenger, George Siegmann. However, his other passenger, his friend, actor Elmer Booth was killed. That tragedy haunted Tod for the remainder of his life, he was never the same and his film work took a different direction entirely. His films became dramas, dark, complex with layers of moral ambiguities, obsessions, revenge and crime that swept away his previous comedies.</span><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">“Fixated on human disfigurement and underworld figures, the films are marked by a stark, obsessive aesthetic and themes of compulsion…His compulsive preoccupation with themes of moral and psychosexual insinuation, interchangeable guilt and patterns of human repulsion and attraction.” Stuart Rosenthal</span><br></div><span class="fs11lh1">One could only think that his 10 collaborations with the “Man of a Thousand Faces” was nothing less than a match made in heaven. “In the screen personality of Lon Chaney, Tod Browning found the perfect embodiment of the type of character that interested him…Chaney’s unconditional dedication to his acting gave his characters the extraordinary intensity that was absolutely essential to the credibility of Browning’s creations.” Stuart Rosenthal</span></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1"><br></span><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1"><i>West of Zanzibar</i></span><span class="fs11lh1"> was based on </span><span class="fs11lh1"><i>Kongo</i></span><span class="fs11lh1">-a hit Broadway play just a couple of years old. That play was inspired the travels throughout the Congo of writer Chester De Vonde. Unfortunately, De Vonde brought home more than ideas, he also contracted a tropical disease which would kill him in a few years. &nbsp;Knowing he was dying; his final days were spent trying to bring his work to film. His fate would have him die literally just hours before MGM bought the rights for $35,000 on January 10, 1928.</span><br></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">The powers that be at MGM knew that Browning was the director to call upon to mold this story for the screen. But changes had to be made for it to pass the censors. Skirting the silent era censorship regime was a full-time job for studios. “The Formula” kept a list of “salacious” play titles that were considered taboo and Kongo was definitely on that list. A title change was the first order of business, but other content followed. Altering titles, character names and a few “gone too far” details could often get studios a bit of a pass. The daughter in the play was turned from someone suffering from syphilis to an alcoholic in the film (was anyone fooled? We think not).</span><br></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Browning also added the prologue of Phroso’s stage magician background which was not in the play (Browning came by this knowledge of circuses and carnivals honestly due to his extensive experiences when he was younger). He also added another signature element—that of the con, working the crowd for a few coins. A couple of scenes which were originally filmed but cut before release are intriguing. The most famous was Chaney’s scene dressed as a sideshow “duck” was cut but was obviously close to Browning’s heart because an almost identical scene had Cleopatra turned into a sideshow chicken at the conclusion of Freaks.</span><br></div> &nbsp;<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Browning and Chaney were on the same page when making films together and Zanzibar is no different. Chaney, as always, owns the film. He often said there was no Chaney off screen, he lived for his characters. Chaney dug deep into Phroso’s psyche, pulling out every flaw, every strength and channelling it all into a the making of Dead Legs, a Conradian demigod hellbent on wringing every drop of revenge he could from his nemesis. In the midst of this, is all the Colonial arrogance, cultural and racial stereotyping all too well known for that era. </span></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Browning's eye for stylization, love of the bizarre and talent for the eerie has carried forward to influence directors David Cronenberg, David Lynch, and Guillermo del Toro.</span></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1"><i>West of Zanzibar</i> turned out to be quite profitable for MGM but as expected there were rumblings. &nbsp;The <i>Harrison’s Reports was particularily vocal</i>: </span><b class="fs14lh1"><i class="fs11lh1">“This piece of filth is the stage play Kongo. And upon this play the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer picture West of Zanzibar has been founded. How any normal person could have thought this horrible syphilitic play could have made an entertaining picture, even with Lon Chaney, who appears in gruesome and repulsive stories, is beyond comprehension.”</i></b><br></div><span class="fs11lh1">In the decades since, Tod Browning’s stature has been elevated by horror fans but his best films gave voice to tormented and afflicted souls. The films with Chaney were essentially horror dramas– precursors to the supernatural horror genre of the following decade. It was refreshing that MGM, known for their slick upscale productions, would give Browning such a free hand to put his personal stamp on his pictures.</span></div><div><br></div>

									<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><div><span class="fs12lh1"><b>MARK OF ZORRO 1920</b></span><b> </b></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><b class="fs11lh1">Swish! Swish! Swish! It could
						only be the mark of Zorro!! And with those 3 short, sharp marks, Douglas
						Fairbanks changed the direction of his career and set the tone for adventure
						movies for decades. </b></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">As there’s a new Zorro ready to
						stream and make fresh fans this year, it’s the perfect time to revisit and
						celebrate the original screen Zorro and reacquaint ourselves with the
						incredible feats of the first King of Hollywood, Douglas Fairbanks. This films’
						success, his fourth for United Artists, buoyed the coffers of UA, changed Fairbanks,
						and moved the bar for future action heroes. &nbsp;</span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">But Fairbanks gave us did something more,
						especially for modern audiences, for we get to revel in the almost lost art of
						real time, in-camera stunt work that embodies all the energy, drive, and
						creativity of the early 20</span><sup>th</sup><span class="fs11lh1"> Century filmmakers. Douglas Fairbanks
						established the double role of Zorro and the foppish Don </span><span class="fs11lh1">Diego, combining action with
						comedy in a romp that established the tradition of the masked superhero-a
						tradition that resonates down through today with such icons as Superman,
						Batman, and Spiderman.</span></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1"><br></span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Fairbanks was already a highly
						popular light comedian with highly entertaining physicality, so one would not
						think that he was taking a big risk with this transition to costume action
						star. But it was and he was worried. So worried that he took precautions just
						in case of failure; he filmed </span><i><span class="fs11lh1">The Nut</span></i><span class="fs11lh1"> &nbsp;in his old style. For Zorro he was
						savvy enough to include his trademark charisma, charm, and humour and make it
						part of his character’s. It was a smart move, as audiences readily embraced his
						new persona as an action-adventure hero. While we may not remember </span><i class="fs11lh1">The Nut</i><span class="fs11lh1">,
						or in fact have anything but superficial knowledge of his light comedy rolls,
						</span><span class="fs11lh1"><i>Mark of Zorro</i> does stands out. It proved a massive hit, and its success
						bolstered his confidence leading to some of his most ambitious works-the
						classics </span><span class="fs11lh1"><i>Robin Hood</i>, </span><span class="fs11lh1"><i>Thief of Bagdad</i>, and the </span><span class="fs11lh1"><i>Black Pirate</i></span><span class="fs11lh1">. Fairbanks never
						looked back during the remainder of his silent film career. His name became so
						linked to big costume adventure epics that it’s difficult to believe he did
						anything else.</span></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1"><br></span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Zorro also turned out to be the perfect showcase for his
						style of daring athletics, joyful exuberance, and mischievous comedy. All later versions
						of Zorro on film, radio, television, video games, and comic books are based on
						the archetype that Fairbanks created, right down to the signature Z. One could
						go a step further and note the influence with more other well-known superheroes
						likes Batman, who one of the co-originators, Bob Kane, had publicly
						acknowledged the Fairbanks' influence (alter ego/mask/cape/lair/signature) right up to Indiana
						Jones (soft spoken scholar vs dynamic athletic hero).</span><br></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Of course, Fairbanks was always well known for his action
						work and with Zorro he increased the intensity and it really shows. From
						the Z mark, (a pure invention of Fairbanks) to exemplary swordplay, the actor
						was completely in-tune with how action translates to audience reaction. As a
						highly trained athlete, he worked out all his own stunts and worked for months
						with a trained swordsman to sharpen his skills. The precision with which he nailed
						every stunt, even ones seemingly simple is a testament to his dedication to the
						screen art. When he leaps onto a table without even a glance, it’s because he’s
						repeatedly practiced it and ascertained by careful measurement the height of
						the table. Hidden handholds were placed to make his climbs look graceful and
						almost, but not quite, superhuman. “Doug always received dozens of letters from
						irate mothers after such a picture. It’s doubtful if any man has been
						responsible for more broken arms and legs.”-Ralph Hancock</span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">After previews, critics were only lukewarm in their praise
						leaving Doug deflated with fears of failure. Despite his public persona as a
						bon vivant, he was racked by insecurities in private. Mary Pickford consoled
						him, saying that the film was great and to wait for the public to see it. The
						public did. The avalanche of fan mail and the monies that poured into the box
						offices were proof that Fairbanks made the right decision and he had found his immortality.
						</span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><b class="fs11lh1">Your movie factoid: “zorro” is the Spanish word for
						“fox”. The Spanish also have an expression: “hacerse uno el zorro” –roughly translating to,
						“to play the fox with someone”—which means to pretend to be stupid. </b></div></div><div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><br></div>

									<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs14lh1"><b>SURREAL SLAPSTICK: </b></span></div><div><span class="fs12lh1-5"><b>Thoughts From Programmer Chris Seguin</b></span></div>
						
						<div><i class="fs11lh1-5"><b>We can watch films on our phones, ipads etc. so why watch
						it on a big screen-what makes a live cinema event in a theatre a great viewing
						experience especially for comedy?</b></i></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1"> For me, it’s twofold. Most importantly, it’s the
						contagious effect of an engaged audience. Laughter begets more laughter; I
						imagine people *might* laugh out loud while watching Chaplin on TV or YouTube,
						but when you get caught up in the whirl of a crowd laughing, it just multiplies
						and multiplies. I remember we had an audience for a Laurel &amp; Hardy film
						where the laughter was so loud that people out on the streets were wondering
						what the noise was. Name a current comedy that’s had that effect on an audience.</span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">The best laughter, of course, is from kids — I’m amazed
						by what they catch (especially in a world they can’t relate to, full of
						candlestick phones, Murphy beds and Model Ts), but comedy is comedy and they
						get it immediately… and can’t stop themselves. The greatest sound during a
						silent comedy screening is the sound of kids.</span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Also, comedy plays better when it’s big. Whether it’s a
						massive pie fight or the subtle lift of an eyebrow in a Buster Keaton reaction
						shot, it just isn’t the same on a phone. These filmmakers knew what they were
						doing, and the films still work in the environment they were designed for 100
						years later.</span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Secondly, silent films are unique in that music plays a huge
						role. “Silent films” is a misnomer. Yes, the films themselves are technically
						silent — but the experience isn’t. No two live screenings are ever the
						same. Music can elevate or kill a comedy, so a great accompanist can take the
						humour to the next level. Jordan Klapmann has an innate feeling for comedy, he
						brings sensitivity and energy to his playing and always does the films justice.
						He deserves the applause he gets at the end of every show. &nbsp;</span></div>
						
						<div><i class="fs11lh1-5"><b>There’s a lot of surrealism ingrained in silent comedy,
						what made Charley Bowers stand out for you that you’d include him?</b></i></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">What I love about Charley Bowers is that he started out as a
						cartoonist and animator, and he sees the world that way. He lives in a place
						where anything can happen, just because he says so. If Model T’s can lay eggs
						that hatch out baby Model T’s, or pussycats can grow from pussywillow trees,
						there you go. He doesn’t need an explanation; he doesn’t bookend what we’re
						seeing as a dream (as Keaton does in Sherlock Jr.). It just is what it is.</span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">But then there’s the character he plays — it’s borderline
						Buster Keaton, he possesses the same ingenuity and vague
						wariness/world-weariness that Buster brings to the table. He’s not a natural
						comedian, but he has a likeable presence that allows us to sit back and enjoy
						his weird little world. </span></div>
						
						<div><i class="fs11lh1-5"><b>Keaton’s Sherlock Jr. is truly one of those enthralling,
						immersive films. If you try to pick it apart it doesn’t make a whole lot of
						sense, but the film works in a big way. Why do you think Sherlock Jr. works as
						well as it does?</b></i></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Keaton was so way ahead of his time in so many ways. He was a
						creative soul with the mind of an engineer. Sherlock Jr. is the ultimate
						manifestation of that. It swings for the fences imagination-wise, but Keaton
						had the technical ingenuity to make it all happen. So not only is he inspired
						by the work of Georges Méliès (which he no doubt saw as a kid travelling in
						vaudeville), he applies remarkable — and to this day baffling — technical
						skill to make his vision happen. Check out the scene where he leaps from the
						audience into the movie screen, and is buffeted by a number of absurd edits as
						his reality shifts once he becomes a flickering image in the film within the
						film. He did this with practical effects and surveyor’s instruments, not a rear
						projection to be seen and definitely not a byte of computer wizardry. In
						Sherlock Jr. he’s a filmmaker who’s literally inside his own film. </span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">The film itself isn’t really designed to make sense. Unlike
						Charley Bowers, Buster makes a point right up front of telling us it’s all a
						crazy dream. So, it gives him a lot of latitude, and you accept it or you
						don’t. If you don’t accept it, you’re at the wrong movie. </span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Why does it work as well as it does today? Because I think
						people really are in awe of what he was able to do 100 years ago, without
						today’s technology. Anyone who thinks of silent comedy as something primitive
						automatically goes, “Woah! Did you see that?” Not only what Keaton does with
						film, but what he does with his body — no stuntmen, no tricks, nothing.
						(And yes, he really did break his neck making this film — you can see it
						happen — but the cameras kept rolling. If that doesn’t impress you,
						nothing will. </span></div>
						
						<div><i class="fs11lh1-5"><b>Uncommon or little-seen comedians have been a bit of a
						specialty for your programme over the years. Outside of the big 3 or 4 comedy
						stars, what are you looking for &nbsp;in a silent comedian that you like the best to include them?</b></i></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">One word: PERSONALITY. It’s a mistake to fall into the
						common misconception that all silent comedy is slapstick: Keystone Cops
						chases, falls off cliffs, pie fights, etc. Sure, there’s a lot of that, but
						what plays best now — and what exhibitors back in the ‘1920s said played
						back then — was personality-driven comedy. Chaplin, Keaton, Harold Lloyd,
						Laurel &amp; Hardy… they all had it. That’s why they’re remembered today and
						Billy Bevan and Snub Pollard aren’t. Larry Semon is a comedian who was hugely
						popular in the 1920s, rivalling Chaplin, but his films were largely huge car
						crashes and big barrels of tar falling on people. It’s funny because it’s
						outrageous, but not necessarily because of Larry Semon. He didn’t have the
						staying power because dropping bigger barrels of tar onto bigger and heavier
						people didn’t get funnier than the last dozen times.</span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Of the “secondary” comedians, Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle never
						fails. His comedy is ingenious but his personality is irresistibly charming.
						Kids, especially, love him. I’ve never seen an audience consistently react to
						someone the way they do with Roscoe. Part of it is because he’s big and round
						and funny to look at, but his smile radiates off the screen. He has “it”. </span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Charley Chase is another; he’s an ordinary fellow caught up in
						slightly extraordinary situations. He doesn’t jump in the air and make goofy
						faces, but he has a great physicality that makes him just sideways enough to be
						human but funny. The more modern equivalent I can think of (even though it’s a 60-year-old
						reference) would be Dick Van Dyke. Maybe Steve Martin in the ‘80s. I’m stymied
						when it comes to a 21<sup>st</sup> century comparison, in all honesty. Kramer?
						Mr. Bean? Somebody help me out here! </span></div>
						
						<div data-line-height="1" class="lh1"><span class="fs11lh1">Oh, then there’s Mabel Normand. People cheered for her at
						the end of our screening of THE NICKELHOPPER. She won over the audience through
						her charm, so they naturally rooted for her when she triumphed in the end. It
						kind of took me by surprise, the film that followed Mabel’s at that screening
						ended up paling in comparison. I learned a really valuable lesson with that!</span></div>

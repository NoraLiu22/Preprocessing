<title>The Muslims Internet Directory: e Process of Choosing the Leader (Caliph) of the Muslims: The Muslim Khilafa</title>
<!-- Meta Description -->
<meta name="description" content="The Muslims Internet Directory: , , , The following article is a paraphrased transcript of a series of four lectures delivered by Gharm Allah Al-Ghamdy to the Muslim Student Association at the University of Southern California. These lectures were given between November 1991 and January 1992, and took place in the MSA House located at 1144 West 37th Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90007. The subject of Al-Ghamdy's lectures was an examination of the processes involved in choosing and removing the Muslim Khalifa. The last Khalifa of the Muslims was removed in 1924 (though some say the position was strictly a powerless, figurehead office for at least 500 years before that). , ,

<h2><a name="definition">Definition of Khilafa and Khalifa</a></h2>
<p>Khalifa is an Arabic word literally meaning &quot;one who replaces someone else
who left or died&quot; (English: caliph). In the context of Islam, however, the word
acquires a narrower meaning. The Muslim Khalifa is the successor (in a line of
successors) to Prophet Muhammad's position as the political, military, and
administrative leader of the Muslims. The prophetic role of Muhammad is strictly
not included in this definition, as the Qur'an and Hadith clearly state that
Muhammad was the last of the prophets. Khilafa is a related Arabic word which,
in the context of Islam, is used to denote the government of the Muslim state,
of which the Khalifa is the head. A workable analogy of Khalifa and Khilafa is
president and presidency or king and monarchy. The Khilafa is a fard kifaya on
the ummah. </p>
<h2><a name="duties">The duties and responsibilities of the Khalifa</a></h2>
<p>The Khalifa of the Muslim ummah must strive to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Safeguard Islam in its original form, and to protect against the
 introduction of new things (bid'a) into Islam. </li>
<li>Establish justice (including punishments for crimes) among the people.
</li>
<li>Ensure the protection of the ummah. People within the boundaries of the
 Muslim state (regardless of whether they are Muslims or not) should feel
 secure enough to be productive. </li>
<li>Protect the physical boundaries of the state through the use of arms and
 other methods. </li>
<li>Defend the rights of Muslims abroad, and to see to it that Islam can
 spread freely in non-Muslim lands (including the use of force). </li>
<li>Organize jihad against any non-Muslim government which prevents Muslim
 da'wah from entering its land. </li>
<li>Collect and distribute zakat and the spoils of war according to the Qur'an
 and Sunnah (and ijtihad, if necessary). This must be done without the use of
 fear as an incentive (unless a person refuses to pay). Zakat is not to be
 taken from the best or worst of people's possessions, but rather from the
 middle. </li>
<li>Pay the salaries of Bayt-ul-Mal employees, i.e., those people whose job is
 the collection of zakat and other state-levied taxes. Their salaries should be
 reasonable and be paid on time. </li>
<li>Hire honest people as helpers, aides, governors, etc. The Khalifa must
 appoint to public office those who are competent and who can give good advice.
 This especially applies to Bayt-ul-Mal officials. </li>
<li>Be heavily involved personally in the acts of governing. The Khalifa must
 be actively checking and overseeing the duties of the government, and
 constantly be guarding against internal corruption. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="prerequisites">The prerequisites to becoming the Khalifa</a></h2>
<p>Muslim scholars have determined certain criteria which any possible candidate
for the Khalifa must meet to be considered legitimate. </p>
<ol>
<li>The Khalifa must be Muslim. </li>
<li>He must be a man. This condition is based on the hadith where the Prophet
 states that a nation would not profit under a woman as its leader. </li>
<li>He must be knowledgeable in Islam, and be able to make independent
 decisions if necessary. </li>
<li>He must be just, have good morals, and be trustworthy. </li>
<li>He must be physically able (non-handicapped), spiritual, brave, and
 helpful to protect the ummah against its enemies. His eyes, ears, tongue, and
 body in general should be in working condition. The point here is to stress an
 independent, dynamic leader for the sake of the ummah, not to discriminate
 against the physically handicapped. Today, for example, an artificial limb
 could be used to offset an otherwise crippling injury. </li>
<li>He must be politically, militarily, and administratively experienced. </li>
<li>He must be from the tribe of Quraish because they used to be the leading
 tribe, the majority. The Prophet has said, &quot;The Khalifas are Quraishi.&quot;
 However, many Muslim scholars have commented on this prerequisite. Al-Mawardi
 has written that the Khalifa should be Quraishi based on the saying of Abu
 Bakr that the Khalifas are Quraishi and their ministers are non-Quraishi. The
 majority of scholars are of this opinion. Other scholars have arrived at a
 different conclusion. Abu Bakr Al-Baqlani has said that the leader of the
 Muslims simply should be from the majority. Muhammad Riya-Ad-Deen and Abu
 Hanifa wrote that the leader must come from the majority to make it easy to
 follow him. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="process">How the Khalifa may be chosen</a></h2>
<p>There are three ways in which the Muslim ummah may choose a new Khalifa.
However, in all three cases, the people are obligated to give the new Khalifa
their bay'a once the process of choosing him is over. People can send
representatives to give their bay'a if the population is large. The three ways
of choosing the Khalifa are by selection, by nomination, and by force. </p>
<ol>
<li>By selection. The Khalifa is selected by a group of the best, most
 Islamically knowledgeable people in the society (not by a general vote of
 everyone). This group is called the Majlis-Ash-Shura (Arabic for &quot;consultative
 council&quot;). The members of the Majlis-ash-Shura are chosen from experts who are
 learned in Islam, and they in turn choose the Khalifa. If the society as a
 whole rejects their choice, the Majlis-ash-Shura must find out why, perhaps
 negotiate with the people, and in general try to resolve the problem -
 however, this situation has never occurred. The Majlis-ash-Shura must have at
 least three people by the definition of a jama'a (a group of three or more
 people). The Muslim scholar Al-Mawardi has noted that in the emergency case of
 no Khalifa and no Majlis-ash-Shura (the situation today), the people should
 create two parties: one being the Majlis-ash-Shura, and the other being a list
 of candidates for the Khalifa. The Majlis-ash-Shura then selects a Khalifa
 from the list of candidates. </li>
<li>By nomination. The current Khalifa may nominate his successor, the next
 Khalifa (as Abu Bakr did with Umar). The people have to accept him just as in
 the first case. If the old Khalifa appoints someone unworthy out of ulterior
 motives, the people must reject that appointee. </li>
<li>By force. If the current Khalifa forces someone on the people to be the
 next Khalifa, but that person is righteous, the people must accept him as long
 as he remains righteous. Similarly, if there is no Khalifa (again, the
 situation today), it is permitted for someone to forcibly seize power and
 declare himself the Khalifa if he guarantees to abide by his responsibilities
 under Islam. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="majlis">The Majlis-Ash-Shura</a></h2>
<p>There is no fixed size for this group, however, it is generally agreed that
it should not be too large. Muslim scholars have established some basic
prerequisites which the members of the Majlis-ash-Shura should have to become
part of that group. All agree that the members must be adults (in Islam, this
means anyone who has entered puberty), and of sound mind. These members are
chosen by the various communities in the ummah. Other prerequisites, while
generally agreed upon, differ slightly from scholar to scholar. </p>
<ul>
<li>Al-Mawardi has written that each member should satisfy three conditions:
 he must be just, he must have enough knowledge of Islam to differentiate
 between a potentially good Khalifa and a bad one, and he must have sufficient
 wisdom and judgment to select the best leader. </li>
<li>Al-Juwayni has four conditions for the Majlis-ash-Shura: each member must
 be a man, knowledgeable, above average relatively, and Muslim. </li>
<li>Abdul-Jabbar is of the opinion that the members must have enough knowledge
 to select he who can be Khalifa - enough Islamic knowledge in particular, and
 wisdom and judgment in general. </li>
<li>Muhammad Rida wrote that the Majlis-ash-Shura should be the best of the
 ummah, composed of the scholars, leaders, soldiers, businessmen, and respected
 people of the society. All the members should have deep knowledge of Islam as
 a basic prerequisite. They must be people whose opinions and decisions are
 obeyed and respected. The Majlis-ash-Shura should have people from many fields
 of expertise to ensure a broad base of support and knowledge. </li>
<li>Faiyadh has written that the Majlis-ash-Shura serves as an intermediary
 between the people and the Khalifa. The most qualified people to be in the
 Majlis-ash-Shura are the leaders of the different 'tribes', the Muslim
 scholars, and those experienced in life (i.e., experts in non-Islamic fields
 like economics, engineering, medicine, etc.). These are also the ones who
 represent the ummah and who can speak against the ummah. </li>
<li>Al-Baghdadi believed that the Khalifa and the Majlis-ash-Shura should be
 selected from amongst those who can choose wisely. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="selection">How the Majlis-ash-Shura selects the Khalifa</a></h2>
<p>There are four conditions which must be met for the Majlis-ash-Shura to
legitimately select a new Khalifa. </p>
<ol>
<li>There must currently be no existing Khalifa. </li>
<li>A qualified and willing individual must accept his nomination by the
 Majlis-ash-Shura. </li>
<li>The nominee must have been selected freely by the Majlis-ash-Shura - and
 the members of the Majlis-ash-Shura must give him their bay'a. </li>
<li>The bay'a must be given to the nominee by the general populace - though
 some scholars say this is optional. </li>
</ol>
<p>Some scholars believe that the bay'a should be given in the presence of two
witnesses, whereas other scholars believe this is unnecessary since selecting
the Khalifa is a public matter. </p>
<p>When the Majlis-ash-Shura votes for the Khalifa, the members must formally
select one of the candidates, and there must be no objection against that
candidate which can be supported by evidence. However, Muslim scholars have
differed on the number of members in the Majlis-ash-Shura needed to select a
Khalifa from the list of candidates. </p>
<ul>
<li>Some scholars say that at least a majority of the Majlis-ash-Shura must
 agree on the new Khalifa. </li>
<li>Al-Ashari believes the Khalifa could be given to an eligible person even
 by a single vote if he comes from the Majlis-ash-Shura and has a good Islamic
 character. There must also be no valid objection supported by evidence or
 witnesses. </li>
<li>Another group of scholar's opinion is that the Khalifa must have two votes
 for him in the Majlis-ash-Shura who are good Muslims (two because the
 Majlis-ash-Shura is a jama'a which is at least three people). </li>
<li>A fourth opinion is that the Khalifa must have four votes (with no
 countering objection) because witnessing to a charge of adultery in Islam
 requires four witnesses. </li>
<li>A fifth opinion holds that at least three votes are necessary to make the
 decision have the strength of a jama'a behind it. </li>
<li>A sixth opinion is that at least five votes are needed to make an even
 stronger decision. </li>
<li>Finally, a seventh group of scholars believes that it requires 40 members
 of the Majlis-ash-Shura to vote for the same candidate for him to become the
 new Khalifa since Friday prayer requires 40 people to be valid (according to
 some scholars). </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="force">Using force to choose the Khalifa</a></h2>
<p>One way the Khalifa may be chosen is through the use of force. Many Muslim
scholars say that if a person has already seized power, then to avoid Muslim
bloodshed that person should be accepted if he upholds his duties as the Khalifa
of the Muslim ummah. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ibn Hanbal wrote that if a Khalifa has seized power, it is haram to fight
 him. However, he must meet his responsibilities under Islam. </li>
<li>Ash-Shafi'i believed that a person who seizes power and then is accepted
 by the people is a legitimate Khalifa. </li>
<li>An-Nawawi believed that if someone forces himself on the ummah, but is
 qualified, then he should be accepted by the people to avoid Muslim bloodshed
 and to preserve Muslim unity. An-Nawawi also claimed that if the new Khalifa
 subsequently does not follow the sunnah of the Prophet precisely, it would be
 still be questionable to fight against him because of the paramount importance
 of avoiding Muslim bloodshed and disunity. </li>
<li>Ibn Khaldun, Al-Asqalani and Al-Juwayni all believed that forceful seizure
 of power by someone is legitimate as long as he follows Islam as the new
 Khalifa. </li>
<li>Ibn Taymiya wrote that after someone has seized power, he is legitimate so
 long as he follows the Qur'an and Sunnah. </li>
</ul>
<p>All scholars are in unanimous agreement that using force to displace an
already established Khalifa who is meeting his responsibilities is forbidden.
</p>
<p>The above scholars rely on the following ahadith to support their opinions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>From Sahih Muslim: A companion of the Prophet named Hudhayfah asked the
 Prophet about what the future holds for the Muslims. The Prophet replied that
 they will be led by devils at some point. The Prophet then added that the
 Muslims should obey these leaders. </li>
<li>From Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim: The Prophet noted that there will
 come leaders whom the Muslims will not like - that is, they will not follow
 the Sunnah precisely. The Prophet continued and ordered the Muslims to &quot;give
 your right to them, and ask God for your right,&quot; or in other words be patient.
</li>
<li>From Sahih Muslim: The Prophet asked people for their bay'a in which he
 asked for obedience during weakness and strength, wealth and poverty. This
 request for obedience from the people applies to the Khalifas as well unless
 they exhibit signs of kufr. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="disobedience">Disobeying and removing the Khalifa</a></h2>
<p>Many Muslim scholars have commented on when it is permissible to disobey or
remove the Khalifa, which is normally forbidden when the Khalifa is meeting all
his responsibilities under Islam. </p>
<ul>
<li>Al-Mawardi believed that if the Khalifa has followed the Qur'an and Sunnah,
 the people must follow and support him. On the other hand, if he becomes
 either unjust or handicapped to the point of ineffectiveness (such as
 blindness or an amputation), then he must be removed. </li>
<li>Al-Baghdadi believed that if the Khalifa deviates from justice, the ummah
 needs to warn him first to return to the straight path. If this fails, then he
 can be removed. </li>
<li>Al-Juwayni held that since Islam is the goal of the ummah, any Khalifa who
 steps away from this goal must be removed. </li>
<li>Ashighistani wrote that if the Khalifa is found to be ignorant,
 oppressive, indifferent, or a kafir after his selection, then he must be
 removed. </li>
<li>Al-Ghazali believed that an oppressive Khalifa must be told to desist from
 his crimes. If he does not, then he must be removed. </li>
<li>Al-Iji believed the ummah has a definite list of permissible reasons to
 remove the Khalifa. </li>
<li>Al-Asqalani wrote that if the Khalifa starts to act as an unbeliever, it
 is prohibited to obey him and obligatory to fight him. It is obligatory to
 stand against him if one can - and this entails a big reward. Those people who
 choose to ignore the situation are in sin, whereas those who cannot fight
 should emigrate (to organize resistance). Al-Asqalani used two ayahs from the
 Qur'an in particular to support his position. The first is from surat Al-Ahzab
 67-68, &quot;...And they would say, 'Our Lord! We obeyed our chiefs and our great
 ones, and they deceived us as to the right path. Our Lord! Give them a double
 penalty and curse them with a very great curse'...&quot;, and the second is from
 surat Al-Baqara 167, &quot;...And those who followed would say, 'If only we had one
 more chance, we would clear ourselves of them, as they have cleared themselves
 of us.' Thus will Allah show them (the fruits of) their deeds as (nothing but)
 regrets. Nor will there be a way for them out of the Fire...&quot; </li>
<li>Muslim reported that Ibn Umar said the Prophet ordered every Muslim to
 obey their leader unless commanded to do something bad, in which case they
 must neither obey nor listen. Muslim also reported that Ibn Malik said the
 best leader is the one where mutual love exists between him and the people,
 and the worst leader generates mutual hate. However, even in the latter case,
 fighting the Khalifa is prohibited unless he enters kufr by stopping prayers
 or zakat for example. </li>
<li>Ibn As-Samit reported that the Prophet said to obey him in all things and
 situations, and not to remove the leaders unless they openly practice kufr.
</li>
<li>Abu Daud reports from Ibn Ujrah that the Prophet entered a masjid, and
 said there will come leaders after him who disobey the Qur'an and Allah. Those
 who help them are not of the Muslims, but if someone opposes them, he or she
 is of the Prophet's people. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Khalifa must be seriously and unrepentantly off the straight path if he
is to be accused of kufr. Actions like neglecting prayers, ignoring the fast,
and claiming that the Qur'an and Sunnah are outdated are the types of crimes
that indicate kufr on the part of the Khalifa. In such circumstances, he must be
warned quietly first before taking any physical action against him. However, in
cases where the Khalifa is not a kafir, but is simply very belligerent (e.g.,
seizing the land of others unjustly), the people are obligated to yield their
rights (including possessions) to avoid bloodshed. Instead, they should pray to
Allah to restore their rights. </p>
<h2><a name="authority">Who has the authority to remove a bad Khalifa</a></h2>
<p>In a the event of a bad Khalifa, the Majlis-ash-Shura must be the voice of
the ummah which steps forward and orders the Khalifa to step down (although they
must warn the Khalifa first of his crimes). If there is no Majlis-ash-Shura, the
general populace must create one first by nominating and appointing people to
form it. No individuals should rise up alone in protest against the Khalifa.
Muslim scholars have elaborated on this subject extensively. </p>
<ul>
<li>Al-Juwayni has written that if the Khalifa acts strangely and is leading
 the Muslims to weakness, the ummah should not allow individuals to step
 forward and challenge the Khalifa because this leads to anarchy. Rather, any
 change must go through the Majlis-ash-Shura. </li>
<li>Al-Mindad believed that an oppressor cannot be the Khalifa, a judge, imam
 for prayer, or even a simple witness. However, if he is already the leader,
 then we must go through the Majlis-ash-Shura first to remove him. </li>
<li>Ash-Shahastani believed that the Khalifa is very important, so in case of
 disagreement between him and the people, no individual should go about
 creating turmoil. Instead, the people should go through the Majlis-ash-Shura.
</li>
<li>Al-Ash'ari noted that the first fitnah or dispute after the Prophet's
 death was the dispute over the Khilafa. </li>
<li>Ibn Taymiya believed that an oppressive Khalifa should not be fought
 against immediately, but rather after going through the Majlis-ash-Shura first
 (and failing). </li>
<li>An-Nawawi wrote that a sinning, oppressive Khalifa should be removed by
 the Majlis-ash-Shura. However, if much bloodshed among the Muslims is
 forthcoming, then the ummah should avoid the fighting and bear him. </li>
<li>Ghazali believed that a bad Khalifa should be borne to avoid the possible
 killing of Muslims. However, the Majlis-ash-Shura should warn the Khalifa
 quietly at first. If the Majlis-ash-Shura is unsuccessful, and fighting is
 threatened, then the ummah must weigh the possible cost of many deaths against
 oppression. Sometimes the bloodshed warrants that the oppressive Khalifa
 should be tolerated. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="removal">The removal of the Khalifa</a></h2>
<p>The Majlis-ash-Shura is the body which has the authority to remove the
Khalifa if he behaves contrary to Islam. At first, the Majlis-ash-Shura must
advise the Khalifa of his deviant behavior, and warn him to stop. If the Khalifa
does not change, then he must be told to resign. If he refuses and threatens to
use physical force to stay on (e.g., a corrupt army backs him), then the Muslim
ummah has three options available to it at that point: </p>
<ol>
<li>Fight him according to some scholars. </li>
<li>Be patient, and let him lead, to avoid Muslim bloodshed. This is the
 strongest opinion: the majority of the ahl-ul-hadith and scholars of the
 Sunnah advocate this view including Malik, Ash-Shafi'i, and Ahmad. </li>
<li>Depending on the circumstance, either fight or be patient according to
 some scholars. </li>
</ol>
<p>When should the ummah have to fight? Muslim scholars all agree that fighting
is obligatory on the ummah when the Khalifa starts to alter Islamic doctrine and
practice. This makes him a clear kafir. Some scholars say that the Khalifa can
be fought even when he becomes only a fasiq - e.g., he believes in prayer, but
does not do it regularly. The majority of scholars say that this particular
offense (neglecting prayer) is kufr anyway - not just fisq. </p>
<h2><a name="abubakr">The Khilafa of Abu Bakr</a></h2>
<p>The method by which Abu Bakr became Khalifa was by selection (ikhtiar) though
there is a difference of opinion on whether the selection was carried out by a
Majlis-ash-Shura or the general populace. There are certain actions of the
Prophet which implied that he wanted Abu Bakr to be the first Khalifa. </p>
<ol>
<li>A woman asked the Prophet who to come back to for help should the Prophet
 not be there (i.e. if the Prophet had died). The Prophet stated Abu Bakr. </li>
<li>The Prophet said, &quot;Follow the best successors after me: Abu Bakr and Umar.&quot;
</li>
<li>When the Prophet became ill, Aisha said that he asked her to call in Abu
 Bakr to write a letter &quot;so that people will not dispute.&quot; </li>
<li>The Prophet asked Abu Bakr to lead the prayer in his absence. </li>
<li>The Prophet informed us of a dream he had in which he pulled some water
 out of a well, followed by Abu Bakr, then by Umar. </li>
<li>During a khutba, the Prophet said, &quot;If I were to choose a best friend from
 the people, I would choose Abu Bakr.&quot; </li>
<li>A man had a dream where the Prophet and Abu Bakr where weighed against
 each other, and the Prophet was found to be heavier. Then Abu Bakr and Umar
 were weighed - Abu Bakr being heavier. Then Umar and Uthman were weighed -
 Umar being heavier. </li>

<!-- Description --><tr><td><b>Description:</b></td><td>The following article is a paraphrased transcript of a series of four lectures delivered by Gharm Allah Al-Ghamdy to the Muslim Student Association at the University of Southern California. These lectures were given between November 1991 and January 1992, and took place in the MSA House located at 1144 West 37th Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90007. The subject of Al-Ghamdy&#039;s lectures was an examination of the processes involved in choosing and removing the Muslim Khalifa. The last Khalifa of the Muslims was removed in 1924 (though some say the position was strictly a powerless, figurehead office for at least 500 years before that). </td></tr>

          <p>Government and society in China were grounded in the Confucian philosophy,
            which held that there was a basic order in the universe and<b> a natural
            harmony linking man, nature, and the cosmos (heaven)</b>; it also held that
            man was by nature a social being, and that the natural order of the universe
            should be reflected in human relations. The family unit was seen as the
            primary social unit; relationships within the family were fundamental
            to all others and comprised three of the &quot;five relationships&quot; that
            were the models for all others: sovereign-subject; husband-wife; parent-child;
            elder brother-younger brother; friend-friend. In this hierarchy of social
            relations, each role had clearly defined duties; reciprocity or mutual
            responsibility between subordinate and superior was fundamental to the
            Confucian concept of human relations. The virtue of <b>filial piety</b>, or
            devotion of the child to his parents, was the foundation for all others.
            When extended to all human beings, it nurtured the highest virtue, <b>humaneness
            (&quot;ren&quot; or &quot;jen&quot;), or the sense of relatedness to
            other persons.
            </b>
          <p>In traditional China it was assumed by adherents of all schools of thought
            that government would be <b>monarchical</b> and that <b>the state had
            its model in the family. </b>The ruler was understood to be at once the
            Son of Heaven, and the father of the people, ruling under the Mandate
            of Heaven. Traditional thinkers, reflecting on the problem of government,
            were concerned primarily not with changing institutions and laws but
            with ensuring the moral uprightness of the ruler and encouraging his
            appropriate conduct as a father-figure. The magistrate, the chief official
            of the lowest level of government and the official closest to the people,
            was known as the &quot;father-mother&quot; official.
            Even today, under a radically different form of government, the Chinese
            term for state is <b>&quot;guo-jia&quot; or &quot;nation-family&quot;,
            suggesting the survival of the idea of this paternal and consensual relationship.
            </b>The first and third of the &quot;five relationships&quot; &#8212; i.e.,
            emperor and minister, father and son &#8212; indicate the parallels between
            family and state.</p>
          <p>The notion of the role of the state as guarantor of the people's welfare
            developed very early, along with the monarchy and the bureaucratic state.
            It was also assumed that good government could bring about order, peace,
            and the good society. Tests of the good ruler were social stability,
            population growth (a reflection of ancient statecraft where the good
            ruler was one who could attract people from other states), and ability
            to create conditions that fostered the people's welfare. The Mandate
            of Heaven was understood as justifying the right to rule, with the corollary
            right to rebel against a ruler who did not fulfill his duties to the
            people. The state played a major role in determining water rights, famine
            control and relief, and insuring social stability. The state encouraged
            people to grow rice and other grains rather than commercial crops in
            order to insure and adequate food supply; it held reserves in state granaries,
            in part to lessen the effects of drought and floods, particularly common
            in northern China. For fear of losing the Mandate of Heaven governments
            levied very low taxes which often meant that the government could not
            provide all the services expected of it, and that officials ended up
          extorting money from the people.</p></td>

              Perfectibility of Man and the Moral Role of Government</span></p>          <p>The dominant strain of Confucian
                thought stressed the <b>perfectibility of man</b>. Confucius (a political
                philosopher who lived c. 551-479 B.C.) expressed a belief in the
                fundamental similarity of all persons and in the perfectibility and
                educability of each individual. Mencius and Hsun Tzu, two of his
                prominent successors, held different views on human nature, Mencius
                arguing that it contained the seeds of goodness, and Hsun Tzu that,
                in its uncultivated state, human nature tended to evil. Both, however,
                believed that human beings were perfectible through <b>self-cultivation</b> and the <b>practice
                of ritual</b>. From the 11th century onward, Neo-Confucian
                philosophers, engaged in the renewal and elaboration of Confucian
                thought, subscribed to the Mencian line, stressing the potential
                goodness of human nature and the importance of developing that goodness
                through <b>education</b>.</p>
              <p>Belief in the innate goodness and perfectibility of man has had
                strong implications for the development of the Chinese political
                system. <b>The ruler's main function in the Confucian state was to
                educate and transform the people. </b>This was ideally accomplished not by legal
                regulation and coercion, but <b>by personal rule, moral example,
                and mediation</b> in disputes by the emperor and his officials. Confucian
                political theory emphasized conflict resolution through mediation,
                rather than through the application of abstract rules to establish
                right and wrong in order to achieve social harmony.</p>
              <p>The belief that the state was the moral guardian of the people was
                reflected in a number of institutions. Most important among these
                was the <b>merit bureaucracy</b>, or <b>civil service</b>, in which all officials
                were to be selected for their moral qualities, qualities that would
                enable them not only to govern, but to set a moral example that would
                transform the people. Because Confucianism was a moral system, the
                Confucian classics had to be mastered by prospective officials. Official
                position and examination degree, not wealth or business acumen, were
          universally recognized marks of status.</p></td>

              and a Strong State</span></p>
          <p>A complementary philosophical strain in Chinese thought was Legalism,
            first applied in the short-lived dynasty of the first emperor, Qin Shi
            Huangdi (Ch'in Shih Huang-ti, 221-207 B.C.). Proponents of Legalism stressed
            an administrative approach to efficient and pragmatic government; universal
            and codified law rather than morality (in contrast to the Confucian emphasis);
            and state power as an end in itself. As first applied, Legalism proved
            too harsh and disruptive, but for two millennia thereafter the Chinese
            state combined aspects of the Legalist structure with the Confucian spirit,
            recognizing the effectiveness of a <b>centralized, bureaucratic rule </b>which
            could oversee massive public works, state monopolies, standardized weights,
            measures, and even script, attempt intellectual control, and enforce
            social order by suppressing revolt.</p>

<p>Although Egypt's urban history is lengthy, modern urbanization,
        characterized by massive and continuing rural-to- urban migration, is
        largely a post-World War II phenomenon. Since 1947, urban growth rates
        have averaged about one percentage point higher than the rates for rural
        areas. Thus, for forty years, the urban population has been expanding at
        the rate of 4 percent annually. <a href="http://worldfacts.us/Egypt-Cairo.htm">Cairo</a>, the country's capital and largest
        city, has been affected the most by this urbanization. Between 1947 and
        1986, the city's population grew from 1.5 million to more than 6 million
        (within the city's corporate limits). During the same period, the
        population of Giza (Al Jizah), across the Nile from Cairo, grew even
        more dramatically, from 18,000 to 1.6 million. In 1989 an estimated 10.5
        million people, or 20 percent of all Egyptians, lived in the urban
        agglomeration known as Greater Cairo, which extended along both banks of
        the Nile from Shubra al Khaymah in the north to Hulwan in the south.
        Within the city's boundaries, the population density averaged 26,000
        people per square kilometer. In some of the more crowded quarters of the
        city, such as Rawd al Faraj, densities were as high as 135,000 per
        square kilometer.
        <p>Cairo is an ancient city, occupying a site that has been continuously
        inhabited for more than 3,500 years. Over the centuries, there have been
        nine distinct cities where Cairo is located. The &quot;modern&quot; city
        was founded in 969 near the site of ancient Egypt's Khere-ohe, better
        known in the West by its Greek name of Heliopolis. In Arabic,
        &quot;Cairo&quot; means &quot;victorious&quot; and is the same name used
        for the planet Mars. Cairo has consistently been a city of preeminence
        in the Arab world for more than 1,000 years, but its political and
        economic influence within and beyond Egypt has varied. One of its more
        illustrious periods ran from 1170 to 1345, when Cairo became one of the
        world's largest cities with a population of about 500,000. The layout of
        central Cairo remains similar to what it was during that time. Many of
        the city's renowned mosques--there are more than 600 Islamic monuments
        in Cairo--also date back to the medieval period. Cairo's importance
        derived from its role as a center for the production and export of
        textiles and refined sugar and for goods manufactured from cotton, flax,
        and sugarcane. Cairo was also a transshipment center for overland trade
        from India and Africa to Europe.
        <p>The plague known as the Black Death devastated Cairo and the rest of
        Egypt between 1347 and 1350. The plague killed about 40 percent of the
        country's population.
        <p>Cairo quickly lost its preeminent role as a transshipment center when
        the Europeans discovered a maritime route to India and China around the
        Cape of Good Hope. Cairo remained Egypt's administrative and commercial
        center, but it experienced relative economic stagnation for the next
        three centuries. By the time Napoleon conquered the city in 1798, its
        population had declined to approximately 200,000.
        <p>During the nineteenth century, the rise of the cotton export trade,
        government sponsorship of industrial development, and the completion of
        the construction of the Suez Canal in 1869 revitalized Cairo, and the
        city began to grow again. During the last half of the nineteenth
        century, the French approach to urban planning changed Cairo's layout.
        Egypt's ruler, Ismail (1863-79), had been educated in France and aspired
        to have his capital rival Paris. To coincide with the ceremonies for the
        opening of the Suez Canal, Ismail proposed a design for
        &quot;modern&quot; Cairo. The proposal included a wooden replica of La
        Scala opera house in Milan. The structure was to host the premier of
        Giuseppe Verdi's opera <em>Aida</em>. Ismail's efforts to build a modern
        Cairo resulted in a separation--still apparent today--between the
        western part of the city, called Al Izbakiya Gardens (which is European)
        and the eastern part (which is Arabic).
        <p>Cairo has continued to grow rapidly since 1850, when its population
        was approximately 250,000. By 1930 the population had reached 1 million.
        Throughout the twentieth century, it has been the most populous city in
        Africa and the Arab world. Cairo's development has been most intense
        since World War II, and has resulted in a variety of problems. The
        city's population, growing about 300,000 per year in the 1980s, has
        strained urban services to the breaking point. Public transportation was
        woefully inadequate in the late 1980s, with about one of every four
        buses out of commission at any given time. Public water supplies, sewer
        facilities, and trash collection were all overburdened. Housing was perhaps the most pressing problem
        because persistent shortages of skilled labor and construction materials
        hampered efforts to build residential units quickly enough to meet
        demand. The demand for moderately priced housing was especially high.
        Some people resorted to clandestine and semilegal housing arrangements;
        as many as 200,000 wooden, cardboard, and metal huts were constructed on
        the roofs of apartment buildings. An estimated 500,000 people were
        living in the mausoleums in the city's cemeteries.
        <p>Alexandria is Egypt's second largest city. Located on the coastline
        of the Mediterranean Sea, it has been an important port ever since it
        was founded by Alexander the Great more than 2,300 years ago. The city
        declined dramatically during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries when
        its maritime trade with Europe virtually ceased as a result of new sea
        routes around Africa to India. When the French landed at Alexandria in
        1798, barely 10,000 people lived in the city. Alexandria grew
        substantially in the nineteenth century because of industrialization and
        Egypt's emergence as an exporter of agricultural commodities to Europe.
        Between 1821 and 1846, Alexandria's population grew from 12,500 to
        164,000. By the end of the century, its population had almost doubled to
        320,000. Between 1947 and 1986, Alexandria's population grew from
        700,000 to 2.7 million.
        <p>In 1990 Alexandria was a major industrial center that included two
        large oil refineries; chemical, cement, and metal plants; textile mills;
        and food processing operations. Alexandria is also the country's most
        important harbor for exports and imports.
        <p>Egypt's third and fourth largest cities, Giza and Shubra al Khaymah,
        are part of Greater Cairo. The rapid growth of these cities since 1947
        is directly related to the growth of Cairo. Giza (1986 population 1.6
        million), opposite the Nile River island of Ar Rawdah, is the location
        of Cairo University and the famed Pyramids of Giza. Shubra al Khaymah
        (1986 population 500,000), on the Nile north of Cairo's Bulaq quarter,
        is a manufacturing suburb with a heavy concentration of textile
        factories.
        <p>As of 1989, Egypt had nine other cities with populations greater than
        200,000. In the Delta were Al Mahallah al Kubra with a population of
        375,000, Tanta with 365,000, Al Mansurah with 335,000, Az Zaqaziq with
        260,000, and Damanhur with 215,000. These five cities were local
        administrative, commercial, and manufacturing centers. At the northern
        and southern termini of the Suez Canal were Port Said with a population
        of 358,000 and Suez with 271,000. In Upper Egypt were Asyut on the Nile
        with a population of 250,000 and Al Fayyum, an oasis with a population
        of 215,000. Five other cities had populations ranging between 150,00 and
        200,000. These included Al Minya, Aswan, and Bani Suwayf in Upper Egypt;
        Kafr ad Dawwar in the Delta; and Ismailia (Al Ismailiyah) on the Suez
        Canal.</p>

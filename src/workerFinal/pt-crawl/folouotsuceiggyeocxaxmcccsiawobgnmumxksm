&quot;Il libro ripercorre e documenta diversi anni di ricerche e scambi teorici di Bolognini con altri artisti, curatori, critici, storici.
[...] Il linguaggio limpido, l'urgenza di stimolare il pensiero critico partendo
da informazioni, nomi, progetti [...]. Con assoluta noncuranza per confini di contesto, Bolognini mischia il diavolo con l'acqua santa, guru dell'etica hacker e del copyleft con guru del collezionismo, accademici acclamati con enfants prodiges delle modificazioni genetiche.
Bolognini stesso ci spiega perché nell'introduzione di questo testo/ricerca. L'arte che si basa sull'uso delle tecnologie è arrivata a una svolta, dopo una prima fase
pionieristica. [...] E' quindi questo il momento d far riflettere gli addetti ai lavori dell'arte
 &ndash;&nbsp; dall'interno dell'esperienza effettuale del <i> producer</i> e non della costruzione teorica del critico
 &ndash;&nbsp; su cosa significa digitale (si veda la conversazione con Simonetta Lux in cui l'autore spiega in maniera incredibilmente semplice ed illuminante la differenza tra analogico e digitale) e che razza di artista è quello che pensa al funzionamento degli strumenti che usa.....&quot;&nbsp;(Lucrezia

<p><b>Prefazione</b>
<p>
Forse
c&rsquo;&egrave; un motivo in pi&ugrave; per pubblicare oggi un libro
sull&rsquo;arte e le &quot;nuove tecnologie&quot;. Naturalmente
queste ultime &ndash; non solo le bio- e le nanotecnologie, ma le
tecnologie digitali, che sono entrate nella produzione artistica ormai da
molti anni &ndash; continuano a porre questioni irrisolte,
alimentando un dibattito tra i pi&ugrave; interessanti all&rsquo;interno
dell&rsquo;arte. Ma a questo si aggiunge una seconda ragione pi&ugrave;
attuale: la parte pi&ugrave; rilevante dell&rsquo;arte
neotecnologica, cio&egrave; quella legata alle tecnologie digitali,
sembra ormai trovarsi a un punto di svolta, e tutto fa pensare che la
produzione artistica stia entrando in una fase <i>postdigitale</i>, o <i>postelettronica</i>.<br>
<PSi
potr&agrave; obiettare che i musei non hanno ancora metabolizzato
l&rsquo;arte digitale, o che i festival dedicati a quest&rsquo;arte,
pur avendo perso vitalit&agrave; negli ultimi anni, continuano ad
attrarre pubblico. E tuttavia diversi elementi evidenziano che si sta
aprendo una nuova stagione: 
</P>Si potrà obiettare che i musei non hanno ancora metabolizzato
l'arte digitale, o che i festival dedicati a quest'arte, pur avendo perso
vitalit&agrave; negli ultimi anni, continuano ad attrarre pubblico. E tuttavia
diversi elementi evidenziano che si sta aprendo una nuova stagione:<BR>

&mdash; innanzitutto
la stessa diffusione delle tecnologie digitali all&rsquo;interno
della produzione artistica, al punto che molti artisti, anche quelli
pi&ugrave; lontani dalle suggestioni neotecnologiche, si trovano ad
usarle;<br>
&mdash; in
secondo luogo la diffusione ai margini della produzione artistica (si
pensi alla stessa net art, che &egrave; spesso indistinguibile da
molti contenuti on-line &ndash; per esempio su YouTube o MySpace &ndash;
prodotti da soggetti che non manifestano intenzioni artistiche;
oppure si pensi al design generativo);<br>
&mdash; infine
lo spostamento della parte pi&ugrave; sperimentale della ricerca
verso altri territori (come le biotecnologie e le nanotecnologie),
pur con l&rsquo;importante eccezione di alcuni lavori di ibridazione
di tecnologie digitali diverse.<br>
<br>
Muovendo
da queste considerazioni mi &egrave; sembrato utile raccogliere qui
alcune conversazioni sull&rsquo;arte neotecnologica, tutte condotte
nel corso degli ultimi tre anni, dunque abbastanza recenti da
guardare alle diverse questioni dal punto di vista dell&rsquo;attuale
prospettiva postdigitale. Alcune delle conversazioni sono legate alla
mia stessa esperienza nell&rsquo;uso artistico delle tecnologie
digitali e sono state fatte in occasioni diverse: una presentazione
all&rsquo;Universit&agrave; &quot;La Sapienza&quot; di Roma
(conversazione con Simonetta Lux), una mostra al Museo di Arte
Contemporanea di Genova (con Sandra Solimano), una al Museo
Laboratorio di Arte Contemporanea di Roma (con Domenico Scudero),
un&rsquo;intervista per RAI International (con Francesca Conte), e un
convegno sulle identit&agrave; locali e i processi di globalizzazione
della World Society of Ekistics (con Shigeki Nagashima).<br>
Altre
conversazioni hanno coinvolto alcuni dei protagonisti (artisti e
teorici) del dibattito sulle questioni trattate: il rapporto tra
produzione artistica e sviluppo tecnologico &egrave; affrontato con
Mario Costa, teorico del &quot;<a href="bolognini_ST.htm">sublime tecnologico</a>&quot; e
direttore di Artmedia; l&rsquo;arte telematica e la questione
dell&rsquo;&quot;autore distribuito&quot; sono discusse con Roy
Ascott, artista che ha anticipato queste tematiche e la poetica del
networking dagli anni Ottanta; l&rsquo;uso artistico delle
biotecnologie &egrave; oggetto di una conversazione con Eduardo Kac,
a cui si devono i primi esperimenti significativi e la stessa
definizione di arte transgenica; con Richard Stallman, coautore del
sistema operativo GNU-Linux, promotore del copyleft e della Free
Software Foundation, sono analizzate alcune questioni poste dalle
tecnologie digitali riguardanti la propriet&agrave; intellettuale, il
copyright e i brevetti; alcuni problemi del collezionismo sono
discussi con Enrico Pedrini, la cui raccolta &egrave; considerata tra
le pi&ugrave; interessanti nell&rsquo;arco che va da dada, fluxus,
minimal art, arte concettuale, fino a tendenze recenti; la funzione
dei festival e il loro rapporto con le tradizionali istituzioni
dell&rsquo;arte vengono esaminati con Gerfried Stocker, direttore di
Ars Electronica, il centro austriaco di Linz diventato da alcuni anni
uno dei luoghi di riferimento per molta parte delle arti
neotecnologiche.&nbsp;<br>
Alcune
di queste conversazioni sono inedite, altre sono state pubblicate su
varie riviste in Italia e in Francia, ma contribuiscono a tracciare
qui un quadro d&rsquo;insieme che le singole conversazioni non
potrebbero dare.<br>
<br>
Nell&rsquo;introdurre 
questa raccolta vorrei sottolineare alcune persistenti difficolt&agrave;
nella comprensione di quest&rsquo;area della ricerca artistica pur
straordinaria (per le questioni che affronta e per i mezzi di cui
dispone). Ci sono alcuni luoghi comuni molto
resistenti nel discorso sull&rsquo;arte che non si accordano con
l&rsquo;arte neotecnologica. E, d&rsquo;altro canto, anche la
definizione di quest&rsquo;arte da parte dei suoi stessi attori
spesso non ne favorisce la comprensione. In questa prefazione vorrei
accennare brevemente a entrambi gli aspetti, in modo che sia chiaro
al lettore da quale prospettiva e con quali premesse sono state
affrontate le diverse questioni:<br>
&mdash; Il
primo luogo comune, ancora presente dopo molti anni, &egrave; che le
nuove tecnologie si possano identificare con la &quot;multimedialit&agrave;&quot;
e dunque con quella eterogenea produzione comunicativa e visiva che &ndash;
si sostiene &ndash; deriva da un approccio ormai indifferenziato alle
tecniche, che dalla pop art in poi sarebbero state tutte ugualmente
legittimate e messe sullo stesso piano. Mi sembra che questa
convinzione, pur radicata, possa valere per le tecnologie di
registrazione e riproduzione (audio e video), ma certamente non vale
per le tecnologie di comunicazione e programmazione &ndash; le reti,
i computer &ndash;, che implicano una profonda discontinuit&agrave;
rispetto al passato e sono all&rsquo;origine della rivoluzione
digitale, anche nell&rsquo;arte. E cos&igrave;, per esempio, non
sorprende di trovare, anche in mostre importanti, computer usati come
tecnologie di riproduzione, per memorizzare immagini o per
selezionarle casualmente, e invece ignorati per quello che sono, cio&egrave;
innanzitutto delle macchine <i>generative</i>.<br>
&mdash; Un
secondo luogo comune (che discende solo in parte dal primo) &egrave;
che nella ricerca artistica non ci sia pi&ugrave; possibilit&agrave;
di scelta e di radicalit&agrave;. Tutto sarebbe indifferenziato e
agli artisti non resterebbe che esprimersi in modo personale e
frammentario. Si tratta di un atteggiamento che ha consentito
all&rsquo;arte nella sua versione postmoderna di accrescere la
propria funzione critica attraverso un continuo processo di
creazione/distruzione di significati. Ma d&rsquo;altra parte questo
stesso atteggiamento ha portato a trascurare il fatto che le
tecnologie digitali introducono nella sperimentazione artistica
alcune questioni forti, legate alla stessa natura dei nuovi media,
all&rsquo;intelligenza artificiale, alla democrazia elettronica, al
coinvolgimento del pubblico attraverso forme di interazione pi&ugrave;
sofisticate, alla delega alla macchina di alcune funzioni creative...
Non &egrave; chiaro come si possa trascurare tutto questo e per&ograve;
pretendere che l&rsquo;arte sia considerata uno strumento essenziale
per la comprensione del presente.<br>
<br>
Poi
ci sono i riti e i luoghi comuni, non meno radicati, all&rsquo;interno
dell&rsquo;arte neotecnologica, che ha avuto i suoi spazi (i festival
e la stessa comunicazione di rete) al di fuori e ai margini del
sistema dell&rsquo;arte. Mi limito a indicarne alcuni:<br>
&mdash; Si tende a considerare l'arte neotecnologica come un'area di
ricerca omogenea anche se variegata: software art, net art,
telerobotica, installazioni di realtà virtuale ecc. E' vero che quasi tutti gli artisti neotecnologici
hanno un denominatore comune: il rapporto autoreferenziale
con le nuove tecnologie, che discende dalla constatazione di trovarsi
all'interno di una trasformazione epocale determinata dallo stesso sviluppo
tecnologico. Ma questo non è sufficiente per identificare
un'area di ricerca omogenea. In realtà gli artisti neotecnologici si
muovono in un campo polarizzato da tre diversi elementi: 1) il sistema
dell'arte, 2) la ricerca scientifica e industriale e 3) l'attivismo politico-culturale
sui media. La distanza da ciascuno di questi è un criterio essenziale
per capire la produzione artistica neotecnologica: ci sono differenze
profonde tra gli artisti &quot;scienziati&quot;, gli artisti &quot;attivisti&quot; e gli
artisti tecnologici che si trovano pi&ugrave; vicino al sistema dell'arte, e di
queste &eacute; necessario che si cominci a rendere conto. Anche perch&eacute;,
dopo oltre vent'anni di ricerca, i giochi sembrano ormai fatti e si tratta
di fare chiarezza evitando che tutta l'arte neotecnologica finisca per
avere le etichette, gi&agrave; abusate, della net art o della software art, magari
confuse con le proprie manifestazioni più commerciali.
<br>
&mdash; L&rsquo;arte
neotecnologica viene spesso identificata con l&rsquo;<i>hi-tech</i>. La mia
convinzione &egrave; che invece i lavori veramente innovativi non
siano quelli che utilizzano le tecnologie pi&ugrave; sofisticate ma,
al contrario, quelli che si basano su un&rsquo;elaborazione povera e
sullo svuotamento del mezzo, vale a dire sulla sua attivazione a
vuoto, sulla riduzione all&rsquo;essenza, sul funzionamento ai minimi
termini, cio&egrave; su <i> procedimenti ereditati dalle stesse
avanguardie del Novecento</i>. Questa parte della ricerca pu&ograve; non
avere grande visibilit&agrave; perch&eacute; non sempre produce
lavori adatti ai festival, ma &egrave; in quest&rsquo;area che si
trovano le cose pi&ugrave; interessanti.<br>
&mdash; Un
altro luogo comune ha indicato per lungo tempo la virtualit&agrave;
come uno degli elementi qualificanti dell&rsquo;arte neotecnologica,
fino a farne quasi un sinonimo. Anche questo pu&ograve; essere
fuorviante. In alcuni casi quest&rsquo;arte &egrave; tutto meno che
&quot;virtuale&quot;: ci sono lavori in cui viene messo al centro
il &quot;dispositivo&quot; e questa &egrave; la premessa per lo
sviluppo di un&rsquo;arte <i> effettuale</i> che sposta la ricerca sul piano
della &quot;realt&agrave;&quot; e del suo &quot;funzionamento&quot;.
Per esempio le mie installazioni di <i> Macchine programmate</i> costruiscono
effettivamente dei flussi di immagini potenzialmente infinite, che
sono immateriali ma reali, cio&egrave; dotate di un&rsquo;esistenza
autonoma dall&rsquo;osservatore.<br>
<br>
Questi
sono alcuni dei punti trattati nelle conversazioni. Naturalmente il
carattere occasionale di ciascuna conversazione non consente di
affrontare tutte le questioni in modo sistematico. Ma spero che il
concreto riferimento alla mia esperienza personale e la
partecipazione di alcuni dei pi&ugrave; straordinari protagonisti
della ricerca artistica e teorica, che ringrazio, possano contribuire
a far emergere un quadro realistico e non di maniera.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><b>Preface</b>
</font>
<p align="left">
Perhaps there is one reason more to publish a book on art and the &quot;new
technologies&quot; today. The first reason, of course, is that the
new technologies &ndash; not only bio- and nanotechnologies, but also
the digital technologies which entered artistic production many years
ago &ndash; continue to pose unsolved issues, feeding a debate which
is among the most interesting in the world of art. But there is a
second more topical reason: the most important area of
neotechnological art, that is, the area linked to the digital
technologies, seems now to be at a turning point, and everything
points to the fact that artistic production is entering a 
<I>post-digital</I> or <I>post-electronic</I>
phase.<br>
One might argue that museums have not yet metabolised digital art, or
that festivals dedicated to this art continue to attract spectators
despite having lost some vitality during the last few years.
Nevertheless, there are various indications that a new season is
about to begin:<BR>

&mdash;&nbsp; firstly, the spread of digital technologies in
artistic production, to the point where many artists, even those
otherwise unresponsive to the fascination of neotechnology, find
themselves using it;<BR>

&mdash; secondly, the
spread at the margins 
of artistic production (one need only think of net art, which is
often indistinguishable from much online content &ndash; for example,
YouTube or MySpace &ndash; produced by people who have no artistic
intentions; or one can also think of generative design);<BR>

&mdash;
finally, the shift of more experimental research towards other
territories (such as biotechnologies and nanotechnologies), even with
the important exception of some works which are hybridisations of
different digital
technologies.<BR><BR>Starting from these reflections, I felt it would
be useful to bring together in this book some conversations on
neotechnological art, all held in the course of the last three years,
in other words recent enough to look at the various issues from the
present post-digital perspective. Some of the conversations revolved
around my own experience in the artistic use of digital technologies
and were held on various occasions: a presentation at the University
&ldquo;La Sapienza&rdquo; of Rome (conversation with Simonetta Lux),
an exhibition at Genoa&rsquo;s Museum of Contemporary Art (with
Sandra Solimano), at Rome&rsquo;s Laboratory Museum of Contemporary
Art (with Domenico Scudero), an interview for RAI International (with
Francesca Conte), and a conference on local identity and the
processes of globalization held by the World Society of Ekistics
(with Shigeki Nagashima).<br>
Other
conversations involved some of the leading figures (artists and
theorists) in the debate about the issues addressed: the relationship
between artistic production and technological development is faced
with Mario Costa, theorist of the &quot;<a href="bolognini_ST.htm">technological sublime</a>&quot;
and director of Artmedia; telematic art and the question of
&quot;distributed authorship&quot; are discussed with Roy Ascott,
an artist who has been anticipating these themes and the poetics of
networking since the 1980s; the artistic use of biotechnologies is
the subject of a conversation with Eduardo Kac, the author of the first significant experiments and
the very
definition of transgenic art; some issues posed by the digital
technologies regarding intellectual property, copyright and patents
are analysed with Richard Stallman, co-author of the GNU-Linux
operating system, promoter of copyleft and the Free Software
Foundation; some of the problems of collectionism are discussed with
Enrico Pedrini, whose collection is considered to be one of the most
interesting in the range that spans from dada, fluxus, minimal art
and conceptual art right up to recent tendencies; the function of
festivals and their relationship with the traditional institutions of
art are examined with Gerfried Stocker, director of Ars Electronica,
the Austrian centre in Linz which for some years now has been one of
the points of reference for much of neotechnological art. <BR>Some of
these conversations are unpublished, others came out in reviews in
Italy and France; together they help to paint an overall picture
which the individual conversations would be unable to give.<BR><BR>In
introducing this collection I would like to emphasise some of the
enduring difficulties in understanding this area of extraordinary
artistic research (extraordinary because of the issues it addresses
and the means it has at its disposal). There are in fact some
resilient commonplaces in art discourse which are in conflict with
neotechnological art. And, equally, even the definition of this art
given by some of its own players often stands in the way of
understanding. In this preface I would like to briefly point out both
aspects, so that it is clear to the reader from which perspective and
on the basis of which premises the various issues have been
addressed:<BR>

&mdash; The first commonplace, still present after many
years, is that the new technologies can be identified with
&quot;multimedia&quot; and hence with that heterogeneous
communicative and visual production which &ndash; it is maintained &ndash;
 derives from a now undifferentiated approach to techniques, which
from pop art onwards have all been equally legitimised and put on the
same plane. It seems evident that while this deeply-rooted conviction
may apply to recording and reproduction technologies (audio and
video), it certainly does not apply to the technologies of
communication and programming &ndash; networks and computers &ndash;
which imply a radical discontinuity with the past and are at the
origin of the digital revolution, also in art. And so, for example,
it is not strange to find, even in important exhibitions, computers
used as reproduction technologies, to memorize or randomly select
images, whereas they are ignored for what they are, that is, above
all <I>generative
</I> machines.<BR>

&mdash; A second commonplace (which derives only in part from the first) is
that there is no longer any possibility of choice or radicality in
artistic research. Everything is undifferentiated and all artists
have to do is to express themselves in a personal and fragmentary
way. This attitude has allowed the post-modern version of art to
heighten its own critical function through a continuous process of
creation/destruction of meaning. But this attitude amounts to
ignoring the fact that digital technologies introduce into artistic
experimentation strong issues which are connected to the very nature
of the new media, to artificial intelligence, to electronic
democracy, to the involvement of the public through more
sophisticated forms of interaction, to the delegation of some
creative functions to the machine&hellip; It is not clear how one
can ignore all this and still expect art to be considered an
essential instrument for the understanding of the present.</P>
<P> Then there are some equally deeply-rooted rituals and commonplaces inside
neotechnological art, which has had its spaces (festivals and even
net communication) outside and at the margins of the art system. I
shall point out only a few:<BR>

&mdash; Many tend to consider
neotechnological art as an area of research that is variegated but
basically homogeneous: software art, net art, telerobotics, virtual
reality, etc. It is true that nearly all neotechnological artists
have one common denominator: a self-referential relationship with the
new technologies, the result of finding oneself inside an
epoch-making transformation determined by technological development
itself. But this is not sufficient to identify an area of homogeneous
research. In reality, neotechnological artists move in a field that centres on three different elements: 1) the art system, 2)
scientific and industrial research and 3) politico-cultural activism
in the media. The distance from each of these is an essential
criterion for understanding neotechnological artistic production:
there are profound differences between &quot;scientist-artists&quot;,
&quot;activist-artists&quot; and technological artists who find
themselves closer to the art system, and we need to become aware of these. This is
important because, after more than twenty years of research, we need to get some
clarity and ensure that all neotechnological art does not end up
bearing the already misused labels of net art or software art, and
perhaps even confused with more commercial manifestations. <BR>

&mdash;
Neotechnological art is often identified with <I>hi-tech</I>.
My conviction is that the truly innovative works are not those that
use the most sophisticated technologies but rather those based on
poor processing and depletion of means, that is, on their own empty
activation, on reduction to essence, on minimal functioning, in other
words, on <I>procedures
inherited from the avant-gardes of the twentieth century</I>.
This part of research may have a low profile because it does not
always produce works designed for festivals, but some of the most
interesting things are to be found in this area.<BR>

&mdash; Another
commonplace has long identified virtuality as one of the defining
elements of neotechnological art, almost to the point of making the
two synonymous. This, too, can be misleading. In some cases this art
is everything other than &quot;virtual&quot;: there are works which
put the &quot;device&quot; at the centre and this is the premise
for the development of an <I>effectual</I>
art that moves research onto the plane of &quot;reality&quot; and
its &quot;functioning&quot;. For example, my installations of
<I>programmed machines</I> effectively construct flows of potentially infinite images, which are
non-material but real, that is they are endowed with an existence
independent of the observer. </P>
<P>These are some of the points dealt with in the conversations. Naturally the
occasional character of the conversations means that they cannot
address all the issues systematically. Yet I hope that the concrete
reference to my personal experience and the participation of some of
the most extraordinary protagonists of artistic and theoretical
research &ndash; whom I would hereby like to thank &ndash; can
contribute to painting a realistic and unmannered picture.

<BR>
SIMONETTA LUX. <i> Let's try and sum up the changes brought about in art by digital 
technologies. I'd like to do so starting from your direct experience and in particular from 
your work with</i> Programmed Machines.
<BR><BR>
MAURIZIO.BOLOGNINI. I began to program these machines to produce endless, random 
images. I wanted constantly different images to flow across the monitors. The idea, which I 
still find exciting, was to create images in continuous expansion. I started in the late 1980s 
with very few machines, but then by the 1990s there were hundreds of them. In 1992, I 
also began to seal some machines, programming them to produce flows of images which 
nobody would see.  A few years later, in 2001, I started to hook up these machines to the 
cell phone network and this allowed me to redefine the 'device', expanding it to include the 
public and their choices. 
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> Let's talk about your first installations of&nbsp; </i>Programmed Machines<i>: if we take this 
work, for example, what is it that changes with the new technologies?</i> 
<BR><BR>
M.B. As I said, each machine creates endless flows of random images and thus, in some 
way, generates out-of-control infinities. In this sense the first point to emphasize is that this 
work tends towards transcending me; it becomes self-sufficient. Initially I am the author of 
the device, as I set down the rules, but then straightaway I become the spectator of its 
autonomous existence. 
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> This also applies to </i><a href="foto/index.htm">Sealed Computers</a><i>, although here the machines function 
without monitors and are sealed (with silicone) to prevent any connection with peripheral
devices.</i> 
<BR><BR>
M.B. Of course, this is a different kind of work, perhaps more radical. When I install these 
machines in the space of a gallery, the images are not visible and all one can perceive is 
the noise of the machines running, usually distributed randomly across the floor. The 
gallery becomes a kind of metaphysical factory: it is as if each machine were tracing its 
own infinite trajectories in a space that didn't exist but was generated by its own 
functioning. <BR> 
There are various aspects to these installations which can be attributed more generally 
to neo-technological art. First of all, delegating to the machine. This implies a self-reduction of the artist's role, but on the other hand allows the artist to expand his action 
indefinitely. Much has been written about the self-reduction of the artist. Of course, one 
can object that even with these technologies the artist continues to be present and to 
express a vision of the world, although this is happening through the creation of devices 
left to themselves. It has often been pointed out that in neo-technological artistic 
production everything leads to the question of the marginality of the subject: delegating 
tasks to the machine, the distributed artist, the giving up of control over the result, for 
which the artist only prepares certain conditions. On the other hand, however, even in this 
context, the artist remains at the origin of his/her own work, albeit differently from the past: 
activating processes over which he/she agrees to lose control, becoming a kind of actor of 
complexity who takes into account the new conditions without being completely 
subordinate to them.
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> These changes also affect the nature of the image.</i> 
<BR><BR>
M.B. Another aspect that can be pointed out starting from these works is that, with digital 
technologies, the image becomes increasingly autonomous. The development of the 
technological image, from photography to generative art, traces a clear line of 
development: the static image becomes dynamic, it becomes a flow, a process, which as 
such is open to the effect of external events, including the participation of the public, thus 
transforming the artist into a spectator of proceedings that have been set in motion and 
made autonomous. 
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> We also find the term virtuality used in relation to the image. 
<BR></i><BR>
M.B. Yes, but perhaps this introduces a more problematic aspect. First of all, we need to 
be clear about what we mean by the term virtual, which in this context may refer to 
different things. There is the virtuality of so-called electronic space, there is the virtuality of 
images generated by computerized processes and, more particularly, of three-dimensional 
representations which use immersive technologies (so-called <I>Virtual Reality</I>), 
creating simulated environments which the user can explore interactively. There has been 
such an emphatic use of this term, especially in the past, that all new media art is often 
identified with the virtual dimension. Frank Popper himself used the expression 'virtual art' 
to talk about 'the present high-resolution version of technological art'. But in some cases 
this can be misleading. Often neo-technological art contains very little that is virtual, and 
one could in fact maintain that the new technologies favor an <I>effectual</I> art, which 
goes beyond representation and also tends to move away from the symbolic and 
metaphorical plane. If there is still some point to distinguishing between artistic research 
and the culture industry connected to the new media, what especially characterizes the 
former is the <I>centrality of the device</I> (the machine, the network, the interaction 
structure of the participants). The most interesting part of neo-technological art focuses on 
the physiology of the new media, their functioning, their technical configurations; whereas 
the narrative told by the media, content and representation belong above all to the culture 
industry. 
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> Can you explain more about what you mean by effectual art in relation to your 
machines?</i>
<BR><BR>
M.B. Perhaps I should try to compare works which use digital technologies with other 
previous works. For example, in attempts to explain my <I>Programmed Machines</I> 
which produce images indefinitely, reference has sometimes been made to Manzoni's 
<I>Line of Infinite Length</I> (1960). Compared to Manzoni's work the flows of images 
produced by these machines are 'real' in the sense that they go beyond the pure 
intellectual stimulation and have an existence independent of the observer. This is why I 
talk about my installations of programmed machines as 'factories', where the work of the 
machines tends effectively to construct parallel universes which are non-material but real. 
It is as if the new technologies allowed the artist to overcome certain limits, almost to 
transcend, in some cases, the separation between reality and imagination.  
<BR>Some interesting points when reflecting on this aspect, comparing before and 
after in the new technologies, can also be found in some writings by Yves Klein. A few 
months ago I put on an exhibition in Nice and one of the works was ICB (<I>Interactive 
Collective Blue</I>), the initialism for my interactive and 'democratic' blues, which, as I 
was in Nice, recalled IKB (<I>International Klein Blue</I>). So I read some things by Klein 
and in particular the <I>Chelsea Hotel Manifesto</I>, where he wrote: 'Would not the 
future artist be he who expressed through an eternal silence an immense painting 
possessing no dimension?'
<BR>Here we have everything: silence, the infinite sequence, the different spatial 
dimension. Obviously Klein was referring to his own work, but it is (perhaps by chance, as 
often happens in art) a prophetic statement which can be more properly applied to the new 
technologies. The correspondences with some characteristics of my <I>Programmed 
Machines</I> may seem surprising, although it really only depends on the fact that the 
idea of silent, immense images in continuous expansion has always been one of the 
aspirations entertained by artists. Creating universes&#8230; Klein expressed this using words 
like 'silence', 'eternal', 'immense'. These machines work in silence (and in some case 
blindly, even denying the spectator the opportunity to view the images produced) and work 
uninterruptedly, in time and space, generating unbounded images. The difference is that 
my machines <I>actually</I> produce these images. Here we have all the power of the 
digital technologies, the effect on art (the before and after) of these technologies, which 
take us beyond the pure metaphorical and symbolic dimension. If we want to continue 
talking of metaphors in relation to neo-technological artistic production they are then 
<I>effectual</I> metaphors. Virtual is also synonymous with unreal, fictitious, merely 
potential, without any concrete existence. One aspect of neo-technological art that I would 
emphasize is that some of the more interesting works are generative and anti-virtual.
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> But this hasn't always been clear, not even to those who deal with neo-technological 
art.</i>
<BR><BR>
M.B. The problem is that for more than two decades - also because of the need for funds - 
part of neo-technological production has grown up on the edges of the art system and of 
scientific research and the culture industry (animations and three-dimensional simulations, 
some areas of software art). The incomprehension of the art institutions has done the rest, 
focusing attention especially on those works which used the more sophisticated 
technologies of representation/simulation, at times only in search of spectacular results, 
almost producing an electronic baroque. However, this is not the only direction in which 
the new technologies are pushing artistic production. I think it is useful to identify at least 
two directions: <BR>
&ndash; on the one hand, there is a more narrative, and at times more aesthetic, tendency, 
connected to the 'virtuality' of the result (images, representation, simulation); <BR>
&ndash; on the other hand, there is a more conceptual tendency, connected to the 'effectual' 
dimension of the device and its abstract, poor and minimal activation. 
<BR>These are obviously tendencies which reflect different sensibilities that are also 
present in non-technological artistic production, and in this sense they will co-exist. But it is 
necessary not to confuse them. The centrality of the device is an essential criterion for 
focusing on an important, albeit minority, side of the research connected to digital 
technologies. 
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> Coming back to the production of images and to your own work, how do these two 
tendencies manifest themselves?</i>
<BR><BR>
M.B. The epigones of computer art probably represent the most traditional type of 
production. In the sixties and seventies people began to use systems of computer graphics 
to produce certain visual results, initially by writing short stand-alone programs and then 
with plug-ins for existing software. Computer art came into being in a technological context 
that was different from today. Nevertheless, many artists continue to move in this direction, 
perhaps only using commercial software, now widely available. Naturally this is a complex 
story, which cannot be reconstructed by passing hastily from the big computers of the 
1960s, which forced artists to work in institutions and companies like IBM, to art on the 
web, as is sometimes done by people who only want to promote the latter. Between these 
two moments there is at least one crucial intermediate stage, namely, the spread of 
personal computers in the 1980s, without which you can explain neither pre-web telematic 
art nor the distance of computer art from works like mine. Only at this point does it become 
evident that in computer art the new media are almost always used to do the work of the 
old ones: personal computers have very clearly shown that digital machines are not 
suitable for these things, but need to be delegated to make decisions, and need to be used 
in a self-sufficient, quantitative way, not subordinated to pre-determined aesthetic results. I 
think that the nature of digital machines brings them closer to dada (despite its aversion to 
technologies) or to conceptual art. This is why my machines are left to function 
autonomously. The quality of the images is always secondary; it is delegated to the 
machine, commissioned to programmers who are not artists, or left to the decisions of 
the public by means of techniques of collective intelligence. 
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> For example, it is delegated to the public in interactive installations like
Collective 
Intelligence Machines, where you hook up your computers to the telephone network so 
that anybody can interfere. You have explained that these are installations which involve 
the public in a similar way to certain applications of electronic democracy. And in this 
context you have also emphasized that digital technologies allow us to pre-figure the 
development 'from interactivity to democracy'. Why do you think this perspective is so 
important?</i>
<BR><BR>
M.B. In these installations the device expands to include the public, which can interact by 
using their own telephone to modify the characteristics of the images, made visible by 
means of large projections on buildings in the open air. These projections bring together 
and short-circuit physical space and electronic space, creating an alienation effect that I 
like to work with. What's more, they are installations which experiment with new forms of 
interactivity. In art interactivity is often overvalued. Anything that is interactive, however 
banal, is considered more important. I think that the digital technologies allow us to 
introduce into art more advanced forms of interactivity, even going so far as to imagine a 
possible evolution from interactivity to democracy. Up to now interactive media 
installations have concentrated on human-machine communication (vertical interaction), 
neglecting any form of collective intelligence (horizontal interaction). I think that this could 
be now reconsidered to produce a change in interactive art, from interaction to decision via 
interactive decision-making. In particular I find that some participation technologies taken 
from electronic democracy (such as real time opinion-convergence techniques) are 
particularly interesting. These are based upon three main features: recursive structure, 
feedback and statistical response. In my interactive installations (such as the Collective 
Intelligence Machines), this means that anybody can continually change their mind and 
send new input, can see the corresponding output in real time, and in so doing they 
contribute to 'decisions' that start up new cycles of images with different characteristics. 
<BR>
Art is more exciting when it tries to anticipate the future, and when it embodies a vision 
that also raises more urgent questions: democracy, collective intelligence (and their 
technological and institutional apparatus) certainly belong to the great questions facing us. 
Jacques Attali explains this very well in his <I>Histoire de l'avenir</I>: we should now get 
used to considering them as essential conditions for survival, just like climate, energy 
sources and cultural integration. Collective intelligence &#8211; this has been clear ever since the 
first off-line experiments in the 1970s &#8211; is not simply the sum of the individual intelligences 
that generate it; it is a separate device. For this reason in future we will be able to think of 
works of art produced by devices of collective intelligence which transcend not only 
intellectual property but the very role of the artist.  
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> Can you give some other examples of what you mean by the centrality of the device 
and, what you also mentioned, the slippage of the work beyond the symbolic plane?</i>
<BR><BR>
M.B. The centrality of the device can be a criterion to analyze many works. Consider, for 
example, two different installations by Eduardo Kac: <I>Essay Concerning Human 
Understanding</I> and <I>Genesis</I>. In Essay (made together with Ikuo 
Nakamura in 1994) a bird and a philodendron are made to communicate with each other. 
The bird is in a cage in Lexington, the philodendron in a vase in New York. The installation 
connects them by means of the telephone line: the bird's song is transmitted to the plant, 
which is equipped with an electrode that registers its response, which is transmitted back 
to the bird and so on. There is no content, there are no relevant metaphors, there is only 
the device. 
<BR>The same cannot be said of <I>Genesis</I>, a complex work, centered on 
problems of bioethics, where there is a heavily symbolic dimension. In this work Kac 
modifies a gene in a laboratory, converting the passage in Genesis which attributes to the 
human species dominion over all living creatures, into a sequence of DNA. The gene is 
implanted in some bacteria, which are then exhibited in an art gallery. Here, via the 
internet, the public is asked to decide whether to bring about a further mutation of the 
bacteria (and thus of their modified DNA), subjecting them to the effects of ultraviolet light. 
<BR>In this case the symbolic content is explicit: if the public decides to modify the 
bacteria displayed in the gallery, this also alters the meaning of the phrase in the Bible 
which in some way they contain. However, it seems absolutely clear to me that what 
makes this work interesting is not its symbolic implication but rather the fact that the 
transformation of the bacteria by the public can actually happen: the symbolic dimension, 
although powerfully present, becomes effectual and is conveyed on to the plane of reality.
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> I'd like to put what we said so far into the broader context of the neo-technological 
arts. Let us recapitulate. The points you have made concern: the transition from the 
'virtuality' of the symbolic dimension of art to the 'reality' of installations based on the 
functioning of 'devices', including the audience; the possibility of expanding one's own will 
and acts indefinitely; the progressive self-determination of the image (from photography to 
generative art); the introduction of more advanced forms of interactivity, to the point where 
it becomes possible to imagine an evolution  from interactivity to democracy. All this, you 
say, also implies a redefinition of the role of the artist, who tends to become a creator of 
devices and a spectator of their autonomous life. How far can these characteristics, so 
evident in your work, be generalized to apply to the art connected to the new
technologies?</i>
<BR><BR>
M.B. They are characteristics present in various cases, although not all of them and not 
always are they in the forefront. First of all, we need to consider different areas within neo-
technological art, and the definitions in use &#8211; which generally only make reference to the 
technology employed: net art, software art, robotic art, etc. &#8211; do not contribute to clarity. 
Lev Manovich distinguished between Duchampland, that is, the contemporary art world, 
and Turingland, that is, digital arts and research into the aesthetic possibilities of the new 
media. In his view, we should not expect art from Turingland which will be accepted in 
Duchampland. I only partially agree with this. I think it is necessary to emphasize first of all 
that neo-technological artists do not belong to a single homogeneous research area (even 
though they have many things in common, first and foremost among which is the self-
referential relationship with the new technologies, held to be at the origin of epoch-making 
transformations, which are not only economic but cultural, aesthetic and political), but they 
move on to territory which is centered upon three main elements: <BR>
&ndash; the art system, <BR>
&ndash; scientific and industrial research, <BR>
&ndash; media activism, in other words, politico-cultural activism in the media. <BR>
I think that the varying distance from these three elements can be important in providing 
a realistic description of neo-technological artistic production: there are significant 
differences between artists-scientists, artists-activists and technological artists closer to 
the art system (not only do they have different training and different technocultures, but 
also different sources of funding and different artistic production). Of course, this does not 
mean that some artists cannot be situated in a number of different zones on this notional 
map. However, I still think it useful to refer to this map so as not to reduce neo-
technological art, or new media art, to an all-embracing definition.  <BR>
Nowadays people tend to put all these things together: aesthetic research and 
technological research, the poetics of networking, experimentation with codes, the 
aesthetics of error, the alteration of interfaces, simple communication via the media&#8230; And 
the (few) reconstructions of this artistic story are still very partial, as they try to bring 
everything into their respective fields, at times with commercial distortions and 
manipulations. If you read certain reconstructions of new media art which start from a 
particular facet of media activism, you will not find Antoni Muntadas or Eduardo Kac, to 
take only two examples of important artists. Instead you will find eToy, Jodi or the RTMark 
group. In others it will be the opposite. Or else you will find, placed in the same context, 
activist artists who deal with free software and open source, or who manipulate and 
deconstruct existing software, and scientist artists who deal with artificial intelligence and 
Virtual Reality. What is the relationship between Jodi's manipulations of the browser and 
Casey Reas's software art? Hardly any. <BR>
Certainly the reference to the new technologies of information and communication, or of 
the manipulation of the body, and the acceleration which these have forced on cultural and 
social mutations, remain the background for everybody: the internet, telepresence, 
telerobotics, virtual reality, augmented reality, biotechnologies&#8230; All this disrupts both the 
operating conditions of cultural production and our material existence. It also implies a 
reconfiguration of the aesthetic experience and its driving role in culture. But these 
reflections are not enough to identify a single homogeneous area, and in fact can now 
apply to much of artistic production, which has now entered a <I>postdigital</I> phase. 
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> Why postdigital?</i> 
<BR><BR>
M.B. Because the first, pioneering, self-referential phase is coming to an end. One might 
say that the importance of the media cannot be exhausted in such a short space of time; 
this is demonstrated by the 160 years of life of photography, the 100 years of the cinema 
and radio and the almost 70 years of television. The same will apply to the digital media. 
However, various elements show that a new postdigital age in art is about to dawn: <BR>
&ndash; First, the pervasive presence of digital technologies in artistic production, due to artists 
who do not necessarily see themselves as belonging to neo-technological art: for example, 
the use of programming tools like Max, Pure Data, vvvv (Vier Vau) and Processing to 
manipulate audio and video data is now fairly common. <BR>
&ndash; Second, the spread of aesthetic content brought about by the new technologies on the 
margins of artistic production: what difference is there between certain artistic works which 
use GPS (<I>Global Positioning System</I>), or which use visualizations based on 
registering certain processes (traffic, electric consumption etc.), and, for example, the 
maps which represent in real time movements in the city of users connected to the cell 
phone network, which some local administrations - including Rome - are commissioning 
from MIT in Boston? Or the <I>social mapping</I> which New York teenagers use to trace 
each other with GPS downloaded onto their cell phones at 3 dollars a month? Or again, 
what difference is there between certain works of net art and some content on-line (so-
called <I>user-generated content</I>) produced and circulated on the internet by users 
who are not artists? Not to mention the growing integration of software art with design: 
generative design has now left the experimental phase and is trying to produce concrete 
things, like some algorithmic architecture projects for downtown Warsaw. One might say 
that this too is digital art, but certainly it belongs to a different phase, the diffusion phase, 
no longer to art as advanced experimentation, as a free zone in which one moves at the 
limits of meaning. When the results are transferred to cultural production or even to the 
practical sphere, the most interesting task of art is completed. <BR>
&ndash; Finally, although I think this is a less important aspect, one ought to consider the shift by 
more experimental research not only towards the hybridization of different digital 
technologies but towards other technologies, in particular bio- and nanotechnologies. 
<BR>
[&#8230;]
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> Let's take up again the distinction between artistic production more connected to 
scientific research and to activism in the media and work by artists who seem to you to be 
closer to the art system. How can we identify the latter, and what do they deal with?</i> 
<BR><BR>
M.B. The list is long: connectivity, interactivity, simultaneity, redefinition of presence 
beyond notions of time and space, new sensorial configurations, and especially the nature 
of the new technologies and what this may reveal about our present state. What these 
artists have in common is not so much a question of the things they deal with as the way in 
which they do so, which can be traced back to the aesthetics of the machine, the device 
activated in a way that is abstract, empty and without content. This is a characteristic 
which perhaps has its origin in the experience of the avant-gardes of the twentieth century, 
and which corresponds to the effectual and anti-virtual dimension of the research I referred 
to earlier. But here I would like to say something more, thinking especially of the artists I 
know personally: it seems to me that this minimal activation of devices, reduced almost to 
pure phenomenality, can only be explained by making reference to their artistic training, to 
practices of art, to the aptitude to limit oneself to the essence, discarding anything which 
goes beyond what is strictly necessary. On the other hand, it would be difficult to imagine 
that an approach of this type, which usually uses lo-tech resources, can be adopted by 
artists with a predominantly scientific training, who would not do so because of their 
research interests and probably the incomprehension of the scientific community itself. 
<BR><BR>
S.L. <i> Let's talk about this tendency of neo-technological art and its relationship with the art 
that came before it.</i> 
<BR><BR>
M.B. This relationship is not always evident. Some aesthetic research connected to the 
neo-technologies points immediately to the art that came before it: I am thinking, for 
example, of certain technological modifications of the body that seek to mark the beginning 
of a postbiological transition (after all, it is but a short step from body art to Stelarc's 
posthuman body connected to the internet, or its 'third arm'); or one can think of some 
works of net art, which may allude to Situationism, or to Fluxus, or on a more banal level, 
of the neopop of videogames. But in many other cases the relationship with the history of 
art is more complicated, and probably can be understood only by considering the centrality 
of the device and the aesthetics of the machine in terms of the 'desemantization' of the 
work. Mario Costa has provided an interesting contribution on this, emphasizing that some 
technological artworks tend to become impersonal, minimal, without symbolic implications, 
almost objective. These are characteristics which are not only to be traced back to the 
influence of artists like Naum Gabo, who combined the artistic and the scientific 
dimension, or Laszlo Moholy Nagy, who understood the centrality of techniques, but to

[&#8230;] SANDRA SOLIMANO. <i> It is almost as if your works were experimenting with two extreme 
situations in relation with the public. There are interactive installations, like 
<a href="foto/cims.htm">CIMs</a>, where 
the public is considered part of the artwork; and then there are installations, like&nbsp;
<a href="foto/index.htm">Sealed Computers</a>, which seem to want to exclude the public even as an observer.</i> 
<BR><BR>
MAURIZIO BOLOGNINI. These are the extreme conditions that we experience with digital technologies: on the 
one hand, maximum exclusion, like spectators watching processes conducted 
autonomously by the machine, and, on the other, maximum inclusion, thanks to the most 
highly developed forms of connectivity and interactivity. This applies to both 
communication and information technologies: the aesthetics of communication makes you 
face up to the ambivalence of electronic space (connectivity space and collective 
intelligence on the one hand, chaos and the marginality of the subject on the other); while 
the aesthetics of programming obliges you to face up to the contradictory consequences of 
delegating decisions to the machine, which puts limits on the subjective dimension of the 
artist but, on the other hand, multiples possibilities and expands actions to infinity. 
<BR><BR>
S.S. <i> In your <a href="foto/index.htm">Sealed Computers</a>, where the absence of the monitor precludes vision, 
spectators find themselves in a situation of infinite possibility. But a different condition 
applies when you connect one of the machines to a projector or to an LCD (as in 
IMachines, which represent the start of your work). What changes when a projector is 
present in your installations? And then, what changes when, as in the CIMs 3rd series, you 
connect up computers and cellular phones?</i> 
<BR><BR>
M.B. Harald Szeemann asked me the same question some years ago, talking about an 
installation in Switzerland where a single machine was connected to a projector while the 
others were not. My first reply was that by connecting up that one machine I was putting 
the audience in a position to understand the working of the installation without any need 
for explanations: the installation could have been abandoned anywhere and everybody 
would have understood. But I realized that there may also have been another aspect: the 
visibility of the images guided and harmonized the audience's imagination. By attributing 
the flow of images of that one machine to all the others, those present had to imagine 
similar flows and become almost part of the installation. I think he agreed. <BR>
Certainly the role of the public is different in interactive installations such as CIMs, 
where the connection to the cell phone network allows anyone to modify the working of the 
machines and the characteristics of the images. CIMs 3 represents the most recent 
development of this series. In the previous versions the public (each person using their 
own telephone) was able to interfere with the working of the machines, making the images 
evolve (in the CIMs 2 variant I could also observe and re-shape the process from a 
distance). Apart from sharing these characteristics with the previous versions, CIMs 3 is 
also a multiple installation, made up of various locations that are distant but coordinated 
across the phone network in one large installation: CIMs 3 is indifferent to the spatial 
dimension of both the work and the public, and it is able to grow on any geographical scale 
and without any limits.
<BR><BR>
S.S. <i> Your <a href="foto/index.htm">Sealed Computers</a> &#8211; I remember talking about this with you when you presented 
them at Villa Croce in 2003 &#8211; seem to be in some ways a 'technological' version of Piero 
Manzoni's Linea infinita. Do you agree with this conceptual reading of your work?</i> 
<BR><BR>
M.B. When I was programming these machines, Manzoni never occurred to me, 
but I think the reference to the dimension of the infinite is interesting. Perhaps the 
difference between the cylindrical box containing Manzoni's line and my machines 
is that the images produced by these latter are not confined within a mental 
dimension: they are not simply psychic stimuli, they have no illusory character, but 
effectively they constitute a space of parallel information, immaterial but real. It is in 
some respects as if new technologies could remove artistic operations from the 
sphere of the symbolic and allow art to overcome the separation between 
imagination and reality, displacing us from the level of hypothesis and metaphor to 
the level of reality. The experience of technological excess is non-symbolic in 
nature. It is comparable to the experience of the natural sublime. Delegating tasks 
to the machine implies giving up expression.....<br>

<p>
          DOMENICO SCUDERO. <i> Some years ago you started using the term 'infoinstallations' to 
describe some of your works, both the programmed computers and the interactive 
installations where you ask the public to interfere with the functioning of the 
machines. Why do you use this term?</i> 
<BR><BR> 
MAURIZIO BOLOGNINI. It seemed to me that it would be able to describe these works as 
distinguished above all from video installations, with which they were sometimes 
confused. Of course, both terms, info-installations and video-installations, only define the 
instruments used, but this is not a totally negligible point. Artists can now have computer 
systems, networks, so they can use advanced forms of interactivity, remote 
communication; they can activate processes based on probability and randomness, 
artificial intelligence and collective intelligence, all of which make it possible for the first 
time to act on the level of 'reality' rather than its representation. I thought of the term 
infoinstallations having in mind a video installation by Paik with dozens of TVs, sequences 
of instantaneous images and deafening noises, which seemed to me a way to exhibit the
'excess' of television technologies, whereas now we were faced with an excess of a 
different nature, that of new digital technologies, which first was not only based on the 
playback of images and sounds, and thus went beyond representation, and secondly was 
not only made up of chaos but of the co-presence of intelligence and chaos. It is this 
aspect that interests me most about the new technologies. Video art puts you in a more or 
less controlled sensory context. Infoart, if we want to use this term, compels you to go 
beyond this dimension and has more to do with the 'functioning' of reality. 
<BR><BR> 
D.S. <i> What is the difference between 'old' and 'new' technologies in artistic production?</i> 
<BR><BR> 
M.B. There are technologies, such as photography and video (but this applies to analog 
technologies in general), which may still represent an extension of the artist, who can use 
them in the traditional, expressive way. This possibility tends to diminish with the digital 
technologies: networks, computers and other digital devices provide the artist for the first 
time with something that tends to go beyond him or her [...]. <BR>
For some time now a certain number of curators who are interested in digital culture 
have tended to relegate to the background the differences between technological and 
neo-technological art (if you like, between media art and new media art), often using very 
reasonable arguments about the need to avoid putting too many limits on the content of 
exhibitions or on the careers of artists. We can readily agree with these arguments (which 
are perhaps a further sign of the current postdigital trend), but as long as we do not forget 
the specific nature of neo-technological aesthetics, which is linked first and foremost to the 
possibility of delegating our own action to devices that can operate autonomously, 
enabling us to take on the role of both maker and spectator of an artwork. Computer-
based technologies make available something which moves in the direction of 
transcending the artist, creating a discrepancy and a disproportion between the artist and 
his/her work. This is what suggested the idea of referring neo-technological art to the 
aesthetics of the sublime, which, in the 18th century, was linked to the grandeur of natural 
phenomena. It must be borne in mind that the technological sublime does not belong to 
video art or media art; it belongs to infoart, or new media art, that is, the art connected with 
the new technologies. <BR>
Generative software art is the most evident example of this. When I program my 
machines to produce a continuous stream of random images, and then I leave them 
running indefinitely, the work becomes something which is as much on the side of the 
artist as on another side, that is, under and beyond my control. In this way the game 
becomes more complicated but more interesting. It can take place on different levels, 
including the challenge of art as the territory reserved for the subject, and the redefinition 
of the role of the artist with respect to technology: in the activation of technological 
processes that are deliberately void of artistic intentionality (like the flow of random images 
produced by a machine), there is still a dimension that goes beyond mere sensoriality; 
here, artistic content does not consist only in producing images as such, but in creating the 
conditions for a controlled experience of sublimity by means of this production. 
<BR><BR> 
D.S. <i> Do you think that the new technologies are calling art and artists into question?</i> 
<BR><BR> 
M.B. Apparently everything continues as usual. However, the new technologies tend to 
drag art onto a different level because, as I said, they tend to create a discrepancy, a 
disparity, between the artist and his work. And this discrepancy seems to me one of the 
most interesting part of research on the new technologies. If by programming my 
machines I can create unpredictable and potentially infinite images, this necessarily shifts 
part of the work from the level of meaning to that of the devices, and thus of control
- or 
loss of control - over their operations.
Then of course this disproportion and discrepancy between the artist and his work may 
reflect others, as in some great game of mirrors: the discrepancy between us and complex 
societies, or even the more overused discrepancy between us and the physical world, the 
difference being, however, that in this case the situation does not get completely out of our 
control: technological excess is partly controllable, so we can undergo experiences, we 
can enable and disable the process, turn on and turn off the machine. In short, it is a 
version of the discrepancy between us and the reality that for the first time we can 
contemplate and reduce to experiment and spectacle.

WSE. <i>  The globalization of art, or perhaps it would be better to say the transformations of 
art in the globalized world, and the influence these can have on culture and local identities 
have been the focus of numerous initiatives. I'd like us to look at this issue here by thinking 
about both the latest trends in artistic production and the use artists are making of the new 
communication technologies. The question I'd like to start from concerns the nature of the 
globalization of art. What do you think is happening, and what are the consequences?</i> 
<BR> <BR> 
MAURIZIO BOLOGNINI. One thing that is quite clear is that the processes of integration 
and globalization are not limited to the economy and technology but, as you pointed out, 
they also affect culture. However, addressing the issue of the so-called globalization of art 
as a phenomenon belonging exclusively to the cultural sphere would appear 
reductive. First, because you cannot talk about art without taking into account the art 
system, that is, the whole apparatus (galleries, museums, Kunsthallen, fairs, auction 
houses, collectors, publishers) that is responsible for the integration of the cultural and the 
economic dimension. Secondly, because cosmopolitanism has always been part of art, but 
this has not prevented the history of art from having its own centre of gravity in the 
economically most powerful countries. This cannot be left out of account. The initiatives 
that relate to the global dimension of art are multiplying, but rarely do they focus on the two 
essential points: 1) the fact that it is a process of integration which is almost always based 
on an Anglo-American and European model, and 2) the possibility that despite this, circuits 
could open up within this process that are genuinely multicultural. 
<BR> <BR> 
WSE. <i> The internet and digital technologies have opened up new possibilities for 
communication and given concrete form to the prospects of globalization and 
multiculturalism. But associating these technologies with aesthetic globalization suggests 
above all hybridization and sampling. Is this what we have to expect from art?</i> 
<BR> <BR> 
M.B. Artists are always interested in communicating and establishing relationships, and 
accordingly they see the internet as a powerful tool for dissemination and 
disintermediation. However, with the internet, aesthetic globalization is not so much a 
question of the work of artists as the content produced by other users (so-called 
UGC). The sampling and hybridization of content are carried out by the network itself. On 
the other hand, we must remember that this trend in art does not only concern the use of 
digital technologies. The idea of artists as cultural DJs, who engage in sampling, mixing 
and constantly reworking what already exists, was established several years ago when 
people began to consider the history of art as an evolutionary process that has reached its 
conclusion. <BR>
This is also the reason why art, its narrative, its branding, are now less tied to the 
vertical dimension (art history) and more to the horizontal dimension (relations with other 
disciplines, other existential and cultural contexts). It is true that this fits well with the ever-
present possibility of recombination provided by digital technologies, thanks to which all 
content is always convertible and at hand. But neo-technological art is not limited to this. In 
my work, for example, the machines are responsible for constantly reworking the 
content. One of my points of departure is the idea of delegating tasks to the machine. I've 
never been interested in the hybridization of content but rather in that of the devices, the 
media. If I want to mix contents I use a machine, and this shifts the meaning of the 
operation to a level other than that of multiculturalism. 
<BR> <BR>
WSE.<i>  Zygmunt Bauman has identified the nature of contemporary art in the denial of all 
canons. Rejecting all current aesthetic method and feeling, artistic production tends to 
identify with a process of continual creation and destruction of meanings, which has the 
effect of relegating rules and convictions to a state of transience. This also seems to pave 
the way for artistic globalization and multiculturalism.</i> 
<BR> <BR> 
M.B. In its postmodern version art has reduced the tendency to erase cultural differences 
in the name of an avant-garde that produces universal values. At the same time, according 
to Bauman, the rejection of all canons has enhanced the critical and liberating function of 
art, forcing the artist and the public to participate in an ongoing process of interpretation 
and meaning creation. <BR>
It seems to me that this perspective explains much of contemporary art production; 
however, it leaves out the part, which fortunately still exists, that while not being directly 
attributable to the idea of the avant-garde, at least owes something to the idea of 
experimentation on significant issues (for example, the impact of new technologies, from 
artificial intelligence to e-democracy). Equally, it is questionable whether the continuous 
creation / destruction of meaning and the denial of canons, which may appear consistent 
with a project of multiculturalism, are not in actual fact the most Western of cultural
manifestations. <BR> 
One can agree with those who consider contemporary artistic creation as a lesson in 
tolerance towards unclassifiable and unpredictable phenomena, but also postmodern 
tolerance, if we want to put it this way, is bound up with Western culture. And perhaps in 
assuming it as a common denominator one should be more realistic. The exchange 
between cultures requires a certain degree of relativism and democracy in the relevant 
context (in this case I mean both the specific context of art and the general context). So 
the question of art in the global world can be seen from two different perspectives: <BR> 
&#8211; if the democracy one is thinking of is relativistic in the sense that its context is relativistic, 
and even allows the coexistence of incompatible positions, then the exchange between 
cultures needs development, time, depth, and in this perspective it is important to protect 
one's own identity (language, culture, knowledge) without damaging the others. Equally, 
artistic production should understand the differences instead of erasing them, which is why 
I think that among the most interesting works are often those that engage with issues of 
cultural conflict and uprooting; <BR> 
&#8211; but if democracy is to be relativistic only in the sense that everything is equal, this 
changes things and all that serves globalization is more speed and superficiality (in the 
literal sense) in order to restore balance in a painless way, using hybridization, mixing, 
syncretistic confusion. <BR>
Both perspectives can be found among artists, but the art system tends towards the
latter.

WSE. <i>  Since we are at a conference on ekistics, there is one last point we would like to 
consider: the galleries, the exhibition spaces themselves are a product of the history of 
Western art. It is true that we have public art and other experiments, but the modernist 
gallery continues to be the leading model. [&#8230;] Your work </i> 
		  <a href="foto/mph.htm">Museophagia Planet Tour</a><i> (MPT, 
1998-99) involved many art galleries, on different continents. What is the relationship 
between this work and the globalization of art? And which galleries seemed most 
interesting to you from this point of view?</i> 
<BR> <BR> 
M.B. MPT was an action that involved several galleries. In 1998 I took all the objects 
(furniture, telephones, etc.) out of the Archivio Cavellini gallery, in Italy, which had the 
effect of devastating the exhibition space. Then I repeated this action in other galleries in 
various cities (Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, Bangkok, etc.). From each of these 
I took furniture and objects, accumulating an itinerant collection which I transported from 
one gallery to another and from one continent to another. This work was not about the 
globalization of art but took it as its background, implying an overall satellite view of the 
exhibition system. <BR>
The galleries I remember with most interest are those in the less obvious places. For 
example, the About Studio, which in 1999 stood at the edge of Chinatown in Bangkok. The 
gallery was on the first floor, and at street level there was a room, the About Café, which 
was deserted during the day but at night was crowded with all kinds of amazing 
people. Downstairs, the decor mixed various styles, but upstairs the exhibition space was 
completely empty, white, sterile, as one has come to expect in galleries all over the 
world. The curators of the gallery were already clearly posing the question of local identity, 
but they were aware that local and global can be abstract categories, and, in particular in 
art the local dimension can become oppressive. Another interesting gallery, again in 
Bangkok, was Visual Dhamma, that at the time was run by a European. <BR>
In Papeete (a city of 60,000 inhabitants in the middle of the Pacific), the galleries were 
all commercial, aimed at a clientele of unsophisticated tourists. The Musée Gauguin was a 
few miles away, but almost without any works and hidden in the vegetation, it was as if it 
were not there. <BR>
The situation in Sydney seemed to me very interesting. Here, in the late 1990s, the 
galleries which displayed works by Aboriginal artists (not only the routes of Songlines but, 
for example, large canvases depicting Cook's sailors about to land on Australian shores, 
bathed in a sinister light) seemed to be entirely detached from so-called international art 
galleries, to the point of occupying different neighborhoods. As I walked around covering 
kilometer after kilometer, I had the impression of a real even if involuntary apartheid. The 
Gitte Weise Gallery, which took part in my action, was one of these international 
galleries. It was in a large building which was linked to a history of discrimination and 
social emancipation. I wondered what would happen if one or two galleries of the other 
species (those of Cook's sailors, rightly or wrongly regarded as second-class) had moved 
to the same building. Certainly it would have been a difficult cohabitation. <BR>
Even in its postmodern version, art, while it may have given up the spirit of the avant-gardes (which implied hostility towards other art), has not yet got over the need to highlight 
differences: the art market continues to feel the need to stratify the audience of collectors 
because, as in the past, it must turn its objects into symbols of distinction and self-affirmation. Distances still matter, in contrast to the global dimension of the processes we 
are talking about and to the implosion of cultures produced by the new communication
technologies.<br><br>

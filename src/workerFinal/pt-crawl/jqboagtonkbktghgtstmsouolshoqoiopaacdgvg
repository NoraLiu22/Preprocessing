<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The family Sarcophagidae, commonly called flesh flies, are
a worldwide family of large-sized, mostly grayish, calypterate
flies. About 2,000 species in over 400 genera have been described.
Adults larviposit on a variety of substrates in which the larva
feeds and develops. Larvae of many species breed in decaying matter,
but others have been recorded as parasites of insects and other
arthropods including spiders and scorpions.</P>

<P><BR>
The fossil record of the family is very poor, with only two unidentified
species having been noted. Of these, Handlirsch (1921: 270) mentioned
the genus <I>Sarcophaga</I> as being represented by material from
Baltic amber, but no specimens have yet been described.</P>

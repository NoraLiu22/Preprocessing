/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 128]]</font> To the 
        ordinary observer the colours of the various kinds of molluscs, insects, 
        reptiles, birds, and mammals, appear to have no use, and to be distributed 
        pretty much at random. There is a general notion that in the tropics everything--insects, 
        birds, and flowers especially--is much more brilliantly coloured than 
        with us; but the idea that we should ever be able to give a satisfactory 
        reason why one creature is white and another black, why this caterpillar 
        is green and that one brown, and a third adorned with stripes and spots 
        of the most gaudy colours, would seem to most persons both presumptuous 
        and absurd. We propose to show, however, that in a large number of cases 
        the colours of animals are of the greatest importance to them, and that 
        sometimes even their very existence depends upon their peculiar tints.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an almost universal rule that each animal 
        either has enemies which seek to feed upon it, or that it seeks itself 
        to feed upon other animals. In the first case, it has to escape its enemies 
        or it cannot long continue to live. This it does either by its swiftness 
        of flight, by its watchfulness, or by hiding itself from view. Some species 
        come abroad only at night, some burrow under ground, many hide themselves 
        among leaves, or bark, or stones, and thus escape destruction. Their enemies, 
        however are as swift and as watchful as they are themselves, and they 
        can in most cases only escape them by avoiding observation. To do this, 
        they must not be too conspicuous; and thus any kind of colouring that 
        renders them hardly visible while seeking their food or attending to their 
        young, actually tends to preserve their lives, and often alone enables 
        them to secure the safety of their offspring. But the enemy who is in 
        pursuit of them is in just the same predicament. He, too, must be concealed 
        by his colour, or he will be seen <font color="990000">[[p. 129]]</font> 
        afar off and his prey will seek a secure concealment. In that case he 
        will simply starve to death, and his race will cease to exist. It thus 
        appears that almost every kind of animal requires concealment; and it 
        might therefore be thought that colour must always be injurious, and ought 
        never to exist. And as colour not only exists, but abounds among the various 
        classes of animals, it may be thought that we have a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, 
        and that protective colouring cannot be of much importance.</p>

      </p><p align="center">Fig. 1.--The Buff-tip Moth.
      </p><p>Further examination, however, shows us that even gay colours are very 
        often protective, because the earth and the sky, the leaves and the flowers, 
        themselves glow with pure and vivid hues. In other cases conspicuous colouring 
        is useful to an animal, as when it is protected by the possession of a 
        deadly sting or a nauseous taste, and the bright or unusual colour warns 
        its would-be enemies to avoid it. There are also a great number of animals 
        who appear to be sufficiently able to take care of themselves without 
        resorting to concealment, and with these the tendency to the production 
        of colour, which seems to be inherent in organic beings, exhibits itself 
        unchecked. Taking all these facts into consideration, we find that there 
        is an ample field for the development of bright and conspicuous colour 
        on the one hand, and for the display of an infinite variety of protective 
        tints on the other, dependent on the structure, the habits, and the instincts 
        of the different kinds of animals.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now consider a few familiar examples 
        of protective colouring. Owing to the mildness of the winter of 1877, 
        and the dampness of the following spring, my garden was overrun with slugs, 
        and I had to wage continual war against them. On every damp evening I 
        would go round the borders, examining the choicest plants, and, taking 
        the slugs off with a knife, deposit them in a jar of strong brine. While 
        doing this, many of them, on being touched, would contract and drop to 
        the ground, and though they fell close under my eyes, I often had some 
        trouble to find them again, owing to their close resemblance to the small 
        pebbles with which the soil abounded. They varied in colour from nearly 
        white, to brown, yellow, and nearly black, and when contracted into an 
        oval lump, they were exactly like the variously-coloured wet pebbles. 
        One black slug with an olive-yellow under-surface, when <font color="990000">[[p. 
        130]]</font> contracted was wonderfully like a blackish flint pebble broken 
        in two, showing the yellowish inside so common in such stones. It may 
        be said that this was only an accidental resemblance, and at first it 
        did not strike me as being anything else; but when, time after time, I 
        lost sight of a slug beneath my very eyes, and had often no other means 
        of finding it again but by touching the various small stones with my knife 
        till I found a soft one, the conviction forced itself upon me that here 
        was a case of true</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S318b.gif" width="40%" height="auto" /></p>
      <p align="center">Fig. 2.--The Lappet Moth.</p>
      <p>protection, and that what deceived me would also probably sometimes deceive 
        the birds and other animals that feed upon slugs. In the tropical forests 
        I had often in the same way to resort to the sense of touch to supplement 
        that of sight, in distinguishing between the Phasmid&aelig; or &quot;stick 
        insects&quot; and real pieces of stick; and as in this case it is universally 
        admitted that the resemblance is a protection to the insects, since it 
        saves them from the attacks of the numerous tropical insectivorous birds, 
        we may well believe that our familiar slugs are similarly protected from 
        the thrushes and other birds which feed upon them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now consider some other cases of protection 
        by colour among animals of our own country, before proceeding to those 
        more wonderful developments which occur chiefly in tropical lands. Every 
        collector of beetles must have observed how many of our<em> Curculionid&aelig;</em> 
        or weevils are brown or speckled, and also that they have the habit, on 
        being touched or alarmed, of falling down on the ground, drawing in their 
        legs and antenn&aelig;, and there becoming undistinguishable from small 
        lumps of earth or stones. Others, however, which are found constantly 
        on nettles and herbage, are beautifully green, and these usually run or 
        fly away when alarmed. A curious little beetle, <em>Onthophilus sulcatus</em>, 
        is brown and furrowed, so as exactly to resemble the seed of some umbelliferous 
        plant. The beautiful Musk-beetle, which usually rests upon the leaves 
        of willows, is green; while the Saperdas and Rhagiums, which frequent 
        timber or posts, are invariably brown or yellowish. It is, however, among 
        our moths, which are at once more conspicuous and more defenceless, that 
        the best examples of protective colouring in this country are to be found. 
        The beautiful green <em>Agriopis aprilina</em> and the dusky <em>Acronycta 
        psi</em> rest during <font color="990000">[[p. 131]]</font> the day on 
        the trunks of trees, and are often completely concealed by their resemblance 
        to the green and grey lichens which surround them. The Lappet-moth (<em>Gastropacha 
        querci</em>), when at rest, so disposes its rich brown wings as to resemble, 
        both in shape and colour, a dead leaf (Fig. 2); while the Buff-tip moth 
        (<em>Pyg&aelig;ra </em> <em>bucephala</em>) so contracts its wings that 
        it looks exactly like a
      thick piece of broken stick, the yellow patch at the extremity of the wings 
      giving the appearance of the freshly-broken end (Fig. 1).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../pics/S318c.gif" width="40%" height="auto" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig. 3.--Jacobe&aelig; Caterpillars.</p>
      <p>This is a case which well illustrates how impossible it is to decide 
        from the appearance of a specimen in a cabinet whether the colours of 
        an animal are or are not protective, for no one would imagine that this 
        handsome and conspicuously-coloured moth could ever deceptively resemble 
        a bit of dead stick, and so obtain protection from its enemies. It is 
        a very common thing in the tropics to find beetles and moths which resemble 
        bird's droppings, and the same occurs in this country; for Mr. A. Sidgwick, 
        in a paper read before the Rugby School Natural History Society, says: 
        &quot;I have myself more than once mistaken <em>Cilix compressa</em>, 
        a little white-and-grey moth, for a piece of bird's dung dropped upon 
        a leaf, and, <em>vice vers&acirc;,</em> the dung for the moth. Two other 
        moths, <em>Bryophila glandifera</em> and <em>B</em>. <em>perla</em>, are 
        the very image of the mortar walls on which they rest; and in Switzerland 
        I amused myself for some time in watching a moth, probably <em>Larentia 
        tripunctaria</em>, fluttering about close to me, and then alighting on 
        a wall of the stone of the district, which it so exactly matched as to 
        be quite invisible a couple of yards off.&quot; It has also been noticed 
        that the general tints of the moths which are on the wing in autumn and 
        winter correspond to the prevailing hues of nature at those seasons. The 
        Rev. Joseph Greene states that the great majority of the autumnal moths 
        are of various shades of yellow and brown, like those of the autumnal 
        foliage; while the winter moths of the genera <em>Cheimatobia</em> and 
        <em>Hybernia</em> are of grey and silvery tints. </p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is among the caterpillars, however, that 
        protective colouring is the most general and conspicuous. An immense number 
        of these creatures are green, corresponding with the tints of the leaves 
        on which they feed, or brown when they rest on bark or twigs; while a 
        large number of the larv&aelig; of <font color="990000">[[p. 132]]</font> 
        the Geometrid&aelig; or Loopers have the habit of sticking themselves 
        out rigidly like sticks, which they exactly resemble in shape as well 
        as in colour. Every one knows, however, that there are a number of very 
        brightly-coloured caterpillars, and it may be asked how these are protected, 
        or why the others need protection if these can do without it. The answer 
        to this question is most instructive, and affords the most conclusive 
        proof that various examples of protective tints in nature really have 
        the effect we impute to them. It has been found by repeated observation 
        and experiment that every green and brown caterpillar, without exception, 
        is greedily eaten by birds, and even by frogs, lizards, and spiders, and 
        that they endeavour to conceal themselves from these numerous enemies 
        by feeding usually at night, while during the day they remain motionless 
        upon leaves, twigs, or bark, of the same colour as themselves. The brightly-coloured 
        caterpillars, on the other hand, were found to be universally rejected 
        by birds when offered to them, and even by lizards, frogs, and spiders. 
        None of these would touch the common spotted caterpillar of the magpie 
        moth (<em>Abraxas grossulariata</em>), nor those of the <em>Cuccullia 
        verbasci</em>, <em>Callimorpha jacbe&aelig;</em> (Fig. 3), or the <em>Anthrocera 
        filipendul&aelig;</em>. Sometimes the caterpillars were seized in the 
        mouth, but always dropped again, as if in disgust at their taste. The 
        same rule was found to apply to all the hairy or spiny caterpillars; and, 
        what is very interesting, the habits of these creatures are correspondingly 
        different from those of the green and brown eatable species. They all 
        feed during the day; they do not conceal themselves, but feed openly, 
        as if courting observation, and secure in the knowledge of their safety 
        from all enemies.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This connection of gay colours and bold habits 
        with non-edibility, throws light on many other cases of bright colouring 
        which might otherwise be adduced as opposed to the theory of protection. 
        Thus, among our beetles we have such conspicuous creatures as the lady-birds 
        <em>(Coccinellid&aelig;</em>) and the &quot;soldiers and sailors&quot; among the 
        Malacoderms, which are all conspicuous and defenceless insects, never 
        hiding themselves, or seeking concealment, or feigning death, as do so 
        many other beetles. The reason is now found to be that, like gaudy caterpillars, 
        they are generally unfit for food. The same explanation may be given of 
        the conspicuous whiteness of certain moths. One of these,<em> Spilosoma</em> 
        <em>menthrasti</em>, is very common, but when given by Mr. Stainton to 
        a brood of young turkeys among hundreds of other worthless moths after 
        a night's &quot;sugaring,&quot; it was always rejected, each bird in succession 
        picking it up and then throwing it down again, as if too nasty to eat. 
        The same thing has been observed with the showy butterflies forming the 
        family <em>Danaid&aelig;</em>. Insect-eating birds were observed by Mr. 
        Belt in South America, catching butterflies which they brought to their 
        nest to feed their young; yet during half an hour they never brought one 
        of the Danaid&aelig;, which were flying lazily about in great numbers.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are other modes of protection, besides 
        a nauseous taste which renders concealment unnecessary. Either weapons 
        or armour have the same effect, if they are sufficiently perfect of their 
        kind to render it useless or dangerous for their enemies to attack them. 
        The best example of armed insects are the bees and wasps, and among these 
        conspicuous colours are the rule, while they usually fly about and seek 
        their food without any attempt at concealment. Other insects have so hard 
        a covering, or such awkward spines, as to be practically uneatable, and 
        among tropical insects many of these are conspicuously or gaudily coloured. 
        One of the few examples we have of this group are the little Ruby-tail 
        wasps (<em>Chrysis</em>) which have no stings, but have the power of rolling 
        themselves up into a ball, which is very hard; and they are so gorgeously 
        coloured as to appear like some curious jewels. Others, again, obtain 
        protection by extreme rapidity of flight, and by concealing themselves 
        in holes or among flowers when at rest, and these are often brilliantly 
        coloured, as in the case of the common Rosechafer. These few examples 
        are merely intended to show that it is no argument against the use of 
        protective colours in some animals, that many others have brilliant and 
        clearly non-protective hues. In those cases, the creatures have certainly 
        some substitute which enables them to live and continue their race. What 
        this substitute is we can in some cases find out, but in many others we 
        are too ignorant of the habits and surroundings of the species to determine 
        whether its peculiar colours are or are not protective, or, if they are 
        not, to determine what are the peculiar conditions which enable it to 
        dispense with this particular kind of safeguard. An excellent example 
        of a brilliantly-coloured insect, which yet obtains protection by its 
        colours, is afforded by the caterpillar of the Emperor moth (<em>Saturnia</em> 
        <em>pavoniaminor</em>). The green body adorned with pink spots <font color="990000">[[p. 
        133]]</font> is pre-eminently beautiful, and in most situations conspicuous; 
        but it feeds on the common heather, and its colours then so completely 
        harmonise with the young green shoots and small pink flowers, that it 
        is with difficulty detected.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving now these familiar examples, to be found 
        everywhere around us, let us cast a glance over a wider field, and see 
        how the general conditions of existence, affecting many different groups 
        of animals at once, influence their coloration for protective purposes. 
        And first let us transport ourselves to the great deserts of the earth, 
        and inquire what kind of animal life we find there. Canon Tristram has 
        travelled much in the Sahara, and he thus describes the characteristic 
        colours of its animal life: &quot;In the desert, where neither trees, 
        brushwood, nor even undulations of the surface, afford the slightest protection 
        against its foes, a modification of colour which shall assimilate an animal 
        to that of the surrounding country is absolutely necessary. Hence, without 
        exception, the upper plumage of every bird, whether lark, chat, sylvian, 
        or sand-grouse, and also the fur of all the smaller mammals, and the skin 
        of all the snakes and lizards, is of one uniform isabelline or sand colour.&quot; 
        This is not a characteristic of one desert, but of all. In a recent account 
        of the Steppe of Erivan in Asia Minor, it is said that &quot;a remarkable feature 
        of the animal inhabitants of the Steppe, insects and reptiles, and especially 
        of the lizards, is the most perfect coincidence of their colouring with 
        the colouring of the Steppe.&quot; More prominent examples of this prevalent 
        tint are such animals as the camel and the lion, which are exactly of 
        the usual tints of sand and sandy rock.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go now to the arctic regions, and we 
        find these reddish-yellow tints entirely wanting, and instead of them 
        pure white, or in a few cases dark-brown or black, where conspicuousness 
        seems of more importance than concealment. All the bears of the globe 
        are brown or black, except the polar bear, which is white. The polar hare, 
        the snow-bunting, the snowy-owl and the jer-falcon, are also white or 
        nearly so; while the arctic fox, the ermine, and the Alpine hare, change 
        white in winter, as does our own Highland ptarmigan. This last bird is 
        a fine example of protective colouring, for its summer plumage so exactly 
        harmonises with the lichen-covered stones among which it delights to sit, 
        that a person may walk through a flock of them without seeing a single 
        bird; and when it changes to white in winter it is equally protected amid 
        the snow which covers the mountains. A striking exception to the usual 
        white covering of arctic animals is the Musk-sheep, or Musk-ox as it is 
        often erroneously called. This animal is of a dark-brown colour, easily 
        seen among the snow and the ice, but the reason of this is not difficult 
        to explain. The Musk-sheep is gregarious, and derives its protection from 
        this habit. A solitary strayed animal would soon become the prey of the 
        polar bears or even of the arctic foxes; it is therefore of more importance 
        that it should see its comrades at a distance, and so be able to rejoin 
        them, than that it should be concealed from its few enemies. Another case 
        is that of the sable, which retains its rich brown fur throughout the 
        severity of a Siberian winter, but at that season it frequents trees, 
        feeding on fruits and berries, and is so active that it catches birds 
        among the branches. Again, the common raven is found in the extreme arctic 
        regions, but is always black; and this is probably because it has no enemies, 
        while, as it feeds on carrion, it does not need to be concealed from its 
        prey. These three cases are exceedingly valuable from a theoretical point 
        of view, for they prove the incorrectness of a common notion that animals 
        may change to white in the arctic regions either from the direct effect 
        of cold, or from some influence of the white reflections from the snow; 
        and they teach us that only those animals become white to whom that colour 
        is useful, while those which either do not require protection or to whom 
        dark colours are actually beneficial, remain totally unaffected. The cause 
        of change must therefore be sought, not in the direct action of external 
        conditions, but in the same general laws of variation and selection which 
        have modified all the other characters of animals in the way most beneficial 
        to them.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nocturnal animals offer equally good examples 
        of protective colouring. Mice, rats, bats, and moles, are all of dusky 
        or blackish hues, and are therefore very difficult to be seen at night; 
        when alone they move about, while during the day they conceal themselves 
        in holes or underground. When concealment by day as well as by night is 
        required, as in the case of owls and goatsuckers, we find dusky mottled 
        tints, assimilating with bark or earth during the day, and not very conspicuous 
        at night. In some few cases nocturnal animals are conspicuous, a striking 
        example of which is the North American skunk, which has much white about 
        it and a large white tail which it carries erect in the most conspicuous 
        manner possible. But the horrible odour emitted by this animal makes it 
        universally dreaded, and its conspicuous tail is thus a signal-flag to 
        all carnivorous animals not to attack it--a parallel case, in fact, to 
        the white moth, <font color="990000">[[p. 134]]</font> which we have already 
        seen was rejected by birds which eat so many other moths.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally striking as a proof that colour is largely 
        protective is the fact, that nowhere but among the evergreen forests of 
        the tropical and sub-tropical zones do we meet with birds the ground-colour 
        of whose plumage is green. Parrots, which are confined to such countries, 
        are generally green, with small patches of vivid colours. In the Eastern 
        tropical islands many pigeons are as green as parrots, and there are numbers 
        of other groups which are of the same colour. Such are the barbets, a 
        family of fruit-eating birds, especially abundant in tropical Asia; the 
        green bulbuls <em>(Phyllornithid&aelig;</em>); the Bee-eaters; the Turacos 
        of tropical Africa, the little White-eyes (<em>Zosterops</em>) of the 
        eastern tropics; and many other groups. These all frequent thick foliage, 
        with which their colours so exactly harmonise that it is most difficult 
        to detect them.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast these with the ordinary colouring of 
        the birds of the region of deciduous trees, of which our own country is 
        a fair example. Here anything approaching a pure green is unknown, while 
        brown or olive is the almost universal body-colour of the plumage. This 
        is the tint which is least conspicuous among the leafless trees and bushes, 
        which prevail for so large a part of the year, and when the need of protection 
        is greatest.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among reptiles these protective tints are very 
        apparent. Our lizards and snakes are all more or less brown or olive tinged, 
        while in the tropics alone they are often of a vivid green, exactly corresponding 
        with the vegetation they dwell among. The curious geckos--flat lizards 
        with dilated toes, which cling to the trunks of trees or to rocks--are 
        often finely marbled with green and grey, so as exactly to resemble the 
        lichen-covered surface on which they cling. Some arboreal snakes of the 
        genus <em>Dipsas</em> are, however, nocturnal; and these, like all other 
        nocturnal animals which require to be concealed, are of dusky colours, 
        being of various shades of black, brown, and olive.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many fishes even, present clear examples of 
        protective colouring. Such as rest on the bottom, like the flounder, skate, 
        sole, or Miller's Thumb, are invariably of the colour of the bottom, and 
        often singularly speckled, so as to resemble sand or gravel. Such as swim 
        near the surface of the water are almost always dark-bluish or greenish 
        above, and white beneath, colours which evidently tend to their concealment 
        from enemies in the air above them or in the water below. The brilliantly-coloured 
        fishes from warm seas are many of them well concealed when surrounded 
        by the brilliant sea-weeds, corals, sea-anemones, and other marine animals, 
        which make the sea-bottom sometimes resemble a fantastic flower-garden. 
        The pipefish and sea-horses (<em>Hippocampus</em>) are excellent examples 
        of this style of colouring. Some of them are greenish, resembling floating 
        sea-weed; but in Australia there is a large species which is covered with 
        curious leafy appendages, and all of a brilliant red colour, and this 
        lives among red sea-weed, and is then perfectly concealed.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, among tropical insects that 
        the most perfect and wonderful cases of protection by colour and marking 
        are to be found, and a very few examples of these must now be given. The 
        best known and most celebrated are the leaf-insects of the genus<em> Phyllium</em>--curious 
        large insects, whose wings and wing-covers are broad and flat, shaped 
        and veined exactly like leaves, while their legs, head, and thorax have 
        all flat dilatations, like the stipules of many plants; and the whole 
        being of the exact green tint of the foliage of the plant they live on, 
        it is actually impossible to detect them when they are not in motion. 
        The walking-stick insects, or spectres, are equally curious. These are 
        long cylindrical insects, often nearly a foot long, and of the exact colour 
        of pieces of greenish or brown sticks. If they have wings, these fold 
        up closely, and are concealed under wing-covers of the same stick-like 
        appearance; while the head and legs are so shaped and jointed as either 
        to fit closely on to the stick-like body, or to appear like branched twigs. 
        These creatures hang about shrubs in the forests, and can seldom be distinguished 
        from small twigs and branches which have fallen from the trees overhead. 
        They remain quite motionless during the day, and feed at night, and they 
        hang anyhow across the foliage, holding on by two or three of their legs 
        only, while the others are closely fitted to the body, and they thus give 
        themselves that unsymmetrical appearance which belongs to accidentally-broken 
        twigs. A few of the species are still further protected by curious green, 
        leafy excrescences all over the body, so as to look exactly like a piece 
        of dead twig overgrown with a delicate moss. Such a one was brought to 
        the present writer in Borneo by a Dyak, who assured him that moss had 
        grown over the insect while alive, and it was only by very close examination 
        that it could be discovered that the supposed moss was really part of 
        the integument of the insect.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even among butterflies, whose gay colours seem 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 135]]</font> only adapted to render them conspicuous, 
        there are equally wonderful examples of protective marking. It was first 
        pointed out by Mr. T. W. Wood (to whose skilful pencil we are indebted 
        for the illustrations to this paper) that our beautiful little Orange-tip 
        butterfly (<em>Anthocharis cardamines</em>, Fig. 4), although so conspicuous 
        when on the wing, is perfectly concealed when resting in the evening in 
        its favourite position among the flower-heads of the wood parsley (<em>Anthriscus 
        sylvestris</em>). Its</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S318d.gif" width="40%" height="auto" /></p>
      <p align="center">Fig. 4.--The Orange-tip Butterfly.</p>
      <p>under surface is beautifully mottled with white and green, which strikingly 
        assimilate with the white and green flower-heads of this plant. Much more 
        wonderful, however, and perhaps the most wonderful of all imitative insects, 
        is the leaf-butterfly of India (<em>Kallima inachis</em>, Fig. 5). This 
        is a rather large and handsome butterfly, of a deep bluish colour, with 
        a broad orange band across the wings. It is thus sufficiently conspicuous; 
        but it flies very quickly, and in a zigzag manner, so as to be caught 
        with great difficulty. It is when at rest that it requires protection, 
        and this it obtains by its colour and markings on the under surface, and 
        by its peculiar habits. The upper wings have an acute lengthened apex, 
        which is exactly the shape of the tip of the leaf of many tropical trees 
        and shrubs; while the hind wings are produced into a short narrow tail, 
        which well represents the stalk of a leaf. Between these points runs a 
        dark curved line, representing the mid-rib, and from this radiate a few 
        oblique markings for the veins of the leaf. The colour of the under side 
        of the wings closely imitates that of dead leaves, but it varies almost 
        infinitely through shades of bright yellow, reddish, ochre, brown, and 
        ashy, just as leaves vary in their different stages of drying and decay. 
        Even more remarkable is the manner in which the diseases and decay of 
        leaves are represented by powdered dots and blotches, often gathered into 
        little groups, so as to imitate in a most marvellous way the various fungi 
        which attack decaying leaves. But to render the disguise effective, it 
        is necessary that the insect should assume the position of a leaf, and 
        this it does most perfectly. It always settles on an upright twig or branch, 
        holding on by its fore legs, while its body (concealed between the lower 
        margins of the wings) rests against the stem which the extremity of the 
        tail, representing the stalk, just touches. The head and antenn&aelig; 
        are concealed between the front margins of the wings, <font color="990000">[[p. 
        136]]</font> and thus nothing is seen at a little distance but what appears 
        to be a dead leaf still attached to the branch. Yet further, the creature 
        seems to have an instinct which leads it to prefer to rest among dead 
        or decaying leaves, which are often very persistent on bushes in the tropical 
        forests; and this combination of form, colour, marking, habit, and instinct, 
        produces a degree of concealment which is perfectly startling. You see 
        this gay butterfly careering along a forest path, and</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S318e.gif" width="40%" height="auto" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig. 5.--Leaf Butterfly of India.</p>
<p>suddenly rest upon a shrub not three yards from you. Approaching carefully, 
        you look for it in vain, and you may often have to touch the branches 
        before it will dart out from under your very eyes. Again you follow it, 
        and mark the very branch on which it has seemed to rest; but in vain you 
        creep forward, and scan minutely every twig and leaf. You see nothing 
        but foliage--some green, some brown and decaying--till the insect again 
        starts forth, and you find that you have been actually gazing upon it 
        without being able to see any difference between it and the surrounding 
        leaves. After repeated experiences of this kind, and knowing exactly what 
        to look for, you are able sometimes to detect it in repose, and are then 
        more than ever amazed at the completeness of the deception, and at the 
        same time profoundly impressed with the protection that must be afforded 
        by this wonderful disguise--a protection whose effect is seen in the wide 
        range and extreme abundance of the species.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, and in that of the moss-covered 
        stick-insect, we see the extreme perfection of imitative colouring; and 
        we can only understand how this has been produced, by always keeping in 
        mind the very much more numerous cases of slight or partial protection 
        by colour or marking. We can only now briefly indicate some of the steps 
        by which such protection is brought about.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the characters of animals are more variable 
        than their colours, though this may appear doubtful when we look at the 
        constant tints and markings of so many animals in a state of nature. There 
        is, however, good reason to believe that even, in cases, these variations 
        are constantly occurring, but, owing to the fact that the tint of each 
        animal is useful to the species, all important deviations from it soon 
        die out. Certain it is that almost every domesticated animal varies in 
        colour, and <font color="990000">[[p. 137]]</font> these varieties, not 
        being hurtful as in a state of nature, are increased and multiplied without 
        end. Now, if we suppose an animal to suffer from being too conspicuous, 
        any variation of colour or marking tending to make it less conspicuous 
        will give it a better chance of life; and as offspring tend to be like 
        their parents, these less conspicuous varieties will often leave successors 
        similarly endowed; but these again varying, some among them will be still 
        more protected; and thus the protective tints will tend to become more 
        and more perfect in each succeeding generation, till their enemies, finding 
        the pursuit too difficult, will confine their attention chiefly to other 
        species. Then there will be no more change till some new enemy appears, 
        when a further advance may take place till the protection becomes sufficiently 
        perfect to place our supposed animal in a slightly better position than 
        its neighbours.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a difficulty to many persons to 
        understand how such variations could explain the curious cases of the 
        Alpine hare, the ptarmigan, and many other animals which become white 
        in winter only, when the ground is covered with snow and that colour serves 
        as a protection. It has, however, been observed, that a slight seasonal 
        change takes place in many animals. Thus, in Siberia, the wolf, the horse, 
        the cow, the roe, elk, reindeer, and two kinds of antelope, all become 
        paler in colour during winter. Now, if either of these species migrated 
        northward, till it came to inhabit a country where the winter snow remained 
        on the ground for half the year, varieties in which the seasonal change 
        was more and more pronounced would have an advantage, and thus, in the 
        course of many generations, an animal might be produced which changed 
        colour as completely as do the arctic fox or the ptarmigan.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now conclude this very brief outline 
        of one of the most curious chapters in natural history. We have shown 
        how varied and how widespread are protective colours among animals; and, 
        if we add to these the cases in which conspicuous colours are useful, 
        sometimes to warn enemies from such as are distasteful or are possessed 
        of dangerous weapons, at other times to aid wandering species to recognise 
        their companions or to find their mates, we shall become satisfied that 
        we have a clue to much of the varied coloration and singular markings 
        throughout the animal kingdom, which at first sight seem to have no purpose 
        but variety and beauty.</p>

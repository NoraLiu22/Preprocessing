        different species of monitor lizards belong to the Varanidae 
        family. Found throughout the Old World, four of the thirty-seven 
        or so species are listed as endangered in the Convention 
        on International Trade in Endangered Species (<a href="http://www.cites.org">CITES</a>), 
        and the rest are all listed as threatened. Despite that 
        fact, monitors listed as &quot;threatened&quot; are being 
        exported from their counties of origin and shipped to 
        different parts of the world to satisfy the lust for the 
        new--it sometimes seems that beginning lizard owners either 
        start with an iguana, a bearded dragon, or with a monitor.</font></p>

              is a Latin word derived from waran, an Arabic word 
              for monitor (so named from the superstitious belief 
              that the Nile Monitor warned of the presence of 
              crocodiles--when what it was probably doing was 
              eating crocodile eggs and young crocs). <I>Exanthema</I> 
              comes from Greek word for 'eruption', an accurate 
              term when describing the bumpy scales (osteoderms) 
              all over the backs of monitors such as the savannah 
              and white-throated monitors. Monitors range in size 
              from the 18-inch tree monitor to the 9-foot water 
              monitor. Within this variety of sizes, temperaments 
              range from shy and reclusive to downright nasty 
              and aggressive. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              classification (taxonomy) of things is a dynamic 
              system, changing as new data revitalizes old discussions 
              resulting in new conclusions. Such has been the 
              story with the lizard commonly known to us as the 
              &quot;savannah monitor.&quot; </FONT><FONT face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              1792, Bosc first described the the monitor we now 
              call &quot;savannah&quot; (or Bosc), naming it <I>Lacerta 
              exanthematicus</I>. Nearly a decade later, Daudin 
              described a similar-looking monitor, naming it <I>Tupinambis 
              albigularis</I>. </FONT></P>

      </TABLE>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Through 
        the years, both species went through severeal renamings, 
        ultimately ending up in the genus <I>Varanus</I>. Ultimately, 
        perhaps because of the simularity in many features of 
        these two monitor species, they were combined together 
        into the same species, with Daudin's monitor being named 
        as a subspecies to the moniter earlier described by Bosc. 
        Thus we had <i>Varanus exanthematicus exanthematicus</i> 
        (savannah monitor) and the <i>V. e. albigularis</i> (the 
        white-throated monitor), a situation which has lasted 
        for 200 years. Until recently.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Because 
        of the consistent differences in scales, placement of 
        the nostrils, and color/patterning, discussions during 
        the 1990s resulted in the two subspecies parting ways. 
        The savannah (Bosc) monitor is now by itself in <i>V. 
        exanthematicus</i>, while the <i>V. e. albigularis</i> 
        has been elevated to its own species, with a subspecies: 
        <i>V. albigularis albigularis</i>, the white-throated 
        monitor, and <i>V. a. microstictus</i>, the black-throated 
        monitor.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">To 
        further confuse matters, the white/black-throated monitors 
        are larger than savannahs and eat a more varied diet in 
        the wild. They are also far less reclusive than the savannahs, 
        and are native to more temperate regions than the savannah 
        monitors. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        savannah monitors can be found in the grassland zones 
        throughout a broad swath of western to eastern central 
        Africa, in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African 
        Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (Zaire), 
        Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, 
        Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, 
        Sierra Leone, Sudan, Togo, and Uganda. The white-throated 
        monitors are found farther east and south, in Angola, 
        Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Republic of South 
        Africa, Southern Democratic Republic of the Congo (Zaire), 
        Southern Ethiopia, Southern Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, 
        Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        majority of the Savannahs coming into this country are 
        shipped from Ghana, Kenya, Togo and Tanzania, with the 
        most from Kenya and Tanzania. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Savannah 
        and white/black-throated monitors have a blunter snout 
        compared to the other monitors. The savannahs can be distinguished 
        from the white/black-throated monitors by having larger 
        osteoderms, especially around the head and neck, and by 
        the placement of their nostrils, which are much closer 
        to the end of the snout in the <i>V. exanthematicus</i> 
        than in the <i>V. albiularis</i>.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Coloring 
        is similar in the two species, shades of dark and dusty 
        gray. <i>V. exanthematicus</i> are dotted with more light 
        spots on their backs than the <i>V. albigularis</i>. The<i> 
        V. albigularis</i> have distinctive dark bands around 
        the tail, markings that are faint on the <i>V. exanthematicus</i>. 
        The savannahs have long, blue forked tongue with are actively 
        used in exploring their environment. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        oldest documented Savannah was over eleven years old when 
        it died; other monitors have been documented at more than 
        fifteen years of age. As care practices are improved and 
        more is learned about the species' needs, lifespan in 
        captivity may increase.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Savannah monitors in captivity tend to be larger than 
        their wild counterparts, due to food being more regularly 
        available: no forced fasting from lack of available prey 
        during the prolonged dry periods, periods that can last 
        from 3-6 months, depending on where the lizard is originally 
        from. While 4 ft STL specimens are rare in the wild, some 
        may reach this length in captivity. Bennett reports wild 
        hatchlings to be around 5 inches (13 cm) STL and 0.25 
        oz (6-7 gm), with wild adults averaging 13 inches (33 
        cm) SVL, 25 inches (64 cm) STL. Wild adults weigh about 
        1.6 pounds (0.753 kg); the largest Bennett weighed was 
        under 4.5 pounds (2 kg). Bennett states that captive bred 
        hatchlings may be larger than than wild hatchlings because 
        of the contolled level of humidity provided in artificial 
        incubators.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Savannahs 
        are generally ready eaters, and will easily increase their 
        weight five to ten times during the course of the first 
        year, more than doubling their hatchling size of two and 
        a half to four inches during that time. </font></p>

      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Things 
        To Consider Before You Buy<br>
        </font></b>While monitors are quiet and do not demand 
        the time and attention that a dog does, they do require 
        a large enclosure and, as they eat frequently, their enclosure 
        needs to be cleaned frequently. They are not naturally 
        tame and so significant time must be spent with them the 
        first year to tame them, and then regular time must be 
        spent interacting with them to keep them tame. If not 
        tamed, you may end up with a flighty, squirmy or aggressive 
        lizard who is no pleasure to handle--or even to go near. 
        They prefer a routine, with regular feeding and cleaning 
        times.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Savannahs 
        are reputed to be intelligent lizards and, as with many 
        reptiles (and other animals) with lots of time on their 
        hands, they spend some time every day trying to escape. 
        Once out, they will cheerfully tear your house apart climbing 
        around, looking for that perfect hiding place--some place 
        very dark, very tight, and very difficult for you to get 
        to. Vents and other access into the walls and major appliance 
        are kid's play to these monitors. Unfortunately, not only 
        can this drive you crazy, it can get expensive repairing 
        and replacing broken objects, and repairing your monitor 
        if it gets injured while out and about. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">On 
        the other hand, providing a savannah-safe area and things 
        for them to climb on, some will do so, contentedly basking 
        for some time before moving on. You can thus let your 
        savannah out into a secured room for regular periods of 
        exercise and sunning through an open window. This will 
        benefit the savannah in many ways, not the least of which 
        will be some exercise to offset their tendency towards 
        obesity (and liver disease).</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If 
        your monitor escapes outside, your neighbors (and the 
        local animal regulatory authorities) will be less than 
        pleased. In fact, some cities or counties ban the ownership 
        of such animals, or require that they be licensed; it 
        is best to check out your local regulations before you 
        buy.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        American Federation of Herpetoculturists had a good set 
        of guidelines the care and handling of monitors. Their 
        guidelines include the restricting of monitor lizards 
        to events at which the public may reasonably expect to 
        see such lizards. This means taking a walk in the park 
        with your lizard is not a good idea unless that park is 
        the site of a science or nature fair which includes public 
        exposure to the animal. Monitors can escape from more 
        than their enclosures; when transporting them, they must 
        be just as secure as they are in their enclosure. Cat 
        and dog air travel kennels make good transporters for 
        larger monitors (if they are being shipped by air, a more 
        secure enclosure must be devised). </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Steps 
        should be taken so that, if by some unlikely happenstance, 
        your monitor does escape its enclosure, it will not be 
        able to escape the house. This is easily done by keeping 
        the door to the room in which the monitor is kept remains 
        closed at all times. If you have young and curious children 
        about (or obnoxious or careless adult friends), you should 
        consider keeping that door locked with a locking mechanism 
        that is out of reach of questing hands.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">When 
        handling a subadult or adult monitor, it is preferable 
        to have a second person present. They can inflict painful 
        bites. Their method of killing prey is to grab it, crush 
        the skull, then shake it back and forth. This is not a 
        lot of fun when they do it to your fingers or hand or, 
        as I found out for myself, your throat. (A few drops of 
        liquor or vinegar placed in the monitor's mouth--when 
        it's head is tilted down towards the ground--is generally 
        sufficient to get the monitor to release its grip.) If 
        you keep in mind that pet owners are responsible for medical 
        and property damages inflicted by their pets, and that 
        monitor bites can be severe enough to require stitches 
        and antibiotic therapy, as much as it may cost to securely 
        house the monitor, it may ultimately be a bargain.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Selecting 
        Your Monitor<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">When 
        at all possible, buy a captive bred monitor; it will be 
        healthier and will acclimate faster to its new surroundings 
        with to human interaction. You want a monitor that is 
        alert, active, inquisitive (not aggressive) and physically 
        filled out. If you must get an imported monitor, look 
        for the same traits. In addition, check for mites, ticks, 
        sores, scabs on the skin. Check the vent to make sure 
        it is clean; ones with fecal matter caked around the vent 
        should be avoided. Eyes should be clear with no secretions. 
        There should be no secretions from the nose or excessive 
        mucous in the mouth. The tissues in the mouth should be 
        uniformly pink. Red spots or yellow cheesy matter are 
        signs of mouthrot. While the animal may not be fully fleshed 
        out, you should avoid those that are &quot;skin and bones.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
        you are home with your new monitor, give it some time 
        to get acclimated. Approach it slowly; avoid abrupt movements. 
        Allow it to hide for the first several days; do not be 
        too concerned if it does not eat during this time. Wild 
        monitors will puff up, hiss, crouch down and back away 
        from you, possible slapping you with their tails. If you 
        allow your animal to get acclimated pretty much on its 
        own, it will be healthier in the long run.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">With 
        in a few weeks, your monitor should be well on its way 
        to being comfortable in its new surroundings, and should 
        be beginning to feed well. Weight gain and growth will 
        be obvious. Keep in mind, however, that some monitors, 
        especially wild-caught ones, do not adjust well to captivity. 
        They remain on the defensive all the time, and may fail 
        to gain weight or grow much. Many savannahs have trouble 
        adapting to change. If you get one from a private party 
        rather than a pet store, expect the monitor to go through 
        the same acclimation process. Once they are used to a 
        routine, it is often difficult for them to get used to 
        a new routine, especially when coupled with new people 
        and different surroundings.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Housing<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">In 
        the long run, it is less expensive to buy an enclosure 
        for your monitor to grow into, rather than to save some 
        money and buy a small enclosure that will not last more 
        than six months or so. Start with a thirty gallon tank 
        at the least; a fifty-five or sixty gallon is even better. 
        You will still need to quickly start planning the enclosure 
        it will be housed in when full grown. At three feet long, 
        it will require an enclosure at least six feet long (preferably 
        longer) and eighteen inches wide. The taller it is, the 
        less likely it will be able to climb out (and they are 
        agile and persistent climbers!). Stay away from open-mesh 
        enclosures as these monitors must be kept warm and, unless 
        you live in a consistently warm environment yourself, 
        it will be costly and complicated to get such an enclosure 
        heated to the proper temperature. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Stay 
        away from screen-sided or topped enclosures (hardware 
        cloth tops are acceptable). Savannahs have incredibly 
        sharp claws, and can easily shred a hole in screen. Make 
        sure that the walls, floor and ceiling are securely attached 
        to each other. If the savannah finds a weak spot, it will 
        work at it and work at it until it works a hole just big 
        enough for it to squeeze through. Along the same lines, 
        keep the enclosure away from drapes, expensive lamps, 
        computer equipment, etc. When taken out of it's enclosure, 
        savannahs will scrabble around trying to hook their claws 
        into anything they can.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Heat<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Savannahs 
        come from hot, dry environments--the savannahs of central 
        and sub-Sahara Africa. The monitors found at the extreme 
        south of the range experience cooler weather. If you live 
        where it is very cold during the winter, the savannah 
        may go through a short seasonal hibernation (but this 
        is not to be encouraged; if it happens it happens, but 
        always have the enclosure set at the proper temperatures). 
        During the day, temperatures should range from 85-90 F 
        (29-32 C). At night, it can drop about 10-15 degrees, 
        to 75-85 F (24-29 C). </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Heat 
        should be provided in two ways: a subtank or sub-substrate 
        heating pad under half the tank, and a basking area; eventually, 
        you may wish to purchase a fiberglass pig blanket and 
        connect it to a thermostat. Heat tapes, incandescent lights, 
        ceramic heating elements are all suitable for providing 
        heat. Use what ever combination is necessary to maintain 
        the proper temperature ranges day and night, and without 
        stressing the monitor at night by burning a white light 
        for heat. A slightly more expensive way to heat the monitor 
        is to keep the room warm, usually by use of a space heater.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hot 
        rocks may be used only for smaller monitors, and only 
        when guarded against getting too hot (see the article 
        on <a href="hotrock.html">hot rocks</a> for well-known 
        problems associated with them). If using a hot rock, it 
        should be connected to a thermostat to keep the surface 
        temperature down to 85-95 F (29-32 C), not the 105 F (40 
        C) that the hot rocks typically reach. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Substrate</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Brown 
        butcher paper is the easiest and least expensive but rather 
        uninteresting. Astroturf or indoor/outdoor carpeting is 
        another possibility. Extra pieces may be kept on hand, 
        already cut to fit, and popped in the tank while the soiled 
        piece is removed for cleaning and disinfecting. Some keep 
        their monitor on wood chips or bark (not cedar or redwood); 
        others use a fine to medium pea gravel. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">While 
        these last two may be aesthetically appealing, there is 
        danger that the monitor may accidentally ingest some of 
        this substrate, causing impactions which may ultimately 
        be lethal. Since male reptiles often evert their hemipenes, 
        and both species may evert cloacal tissue when defecating, 
        small particulate substrate can stick to the everted tissue, 
        being drawn back up into the cloaca, causing injury and 
        infection. Particulate substrates such as rock, pea gravel 
        and bark are also be more difficult to clean and disinfect, 
        and expensive to replace regularly.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Shelter<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Savannahs 
        like their privacy. Provide shelters at both ends of the 
        gradient. Commercially available &quot;caves&quot; and 
        half-logs work well for small monitors, but they become 
        prohibitively expensive or impossible to find in a size 
        suitable for full grown savannahs. Recycle cardboard tissue 
        boxes or any other box into which your monitor will fit. 
        The advantage of using such boxes is that they are easily 
        and inexpensively replaced with bigger ones as your monitor 
        grows. Larger monitors can be provided wooden shelters; 
        they can be decorated with rock, mosses, bark, etc. to 
        &quot;dress&quot; them up. Keep in mind that, when designing 
        a naturalistic terrarium, monitors come from rather sere 
        surroundings.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lighting<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Monitors, 
        like other lizards, do best with ultraviolet B for calcium 
        metabolism, and a regular photoperiod. Use a Vita-Lite 
        or other UVB-producing fluorescent tube (not a plant or 
        aquarium light) plugged into a household appliance timer. 
        Set the timer to be one 10-12 hours a day, slightly less 
        during the winter. Black- and very high output ultraviolet 
        bulbs eyes can damage monitor eyes and cause immune suppression 
        and so should be avoided. If you can provide real sunlight, 
        either coming in through a window screen (not glass or 
        Plexiglas), or in a semi-shaded secured area out-of-doors 
        on a regular basis, you may be able to do without as much 
        artificial supplementation.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Food<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A 
        healthy savannah will feed just about any time you offer 
        food; one that does not willingly eat (and who is not 
        in a seasonal hibernation or breeding season), then your 
        monitor is very likely ill. Healthy, well-fleshed monitors 
        can easily get through the hibernation and breeding season 
        without any serious loss; sick monitors should not be 
        allowed to go that long without food.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hatchlings 
        can be started on crickets, earthworms, Zoophoba (&quot;king&quot; 
        worms) and pink mice. Feed insects that are no bigger 
        than 2/3 the length of the lizard's head, and start on 
        pinkies when the monitor is a couple of months old and 
        have grown large enough for them. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">As 
        the hatchling grows bigger, switch to fuzzy mice. Savannahs 
        are secretive, especially small ones who are prey for 
        other, larger, animals. The exercise they get chasing 
        the crickets is good for them, so do feed them crickets 
        during this period as long as they will take them. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A 
        small amount of high quality, low fat, canned dog food 
        may be offered to scrawny hatchlings and juveniles, but 
        do so to adults <i>only</i> when sick and they need extra 
        calories. Better yet, use an food product made especially 
        for for force-feeding or otherwise nutritionally supporting 
        sick carnivorous animals, such as Hill's a/d. Better still, 
        get sick savannah's to the reptile vet to be thoroughly 
        checked out and make sure that the sick lizard is getting 
        the right supportive care.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Warning: 
        <br>
        </i> </b> With adults and younger savannahs, too much 
        of even a good quality dog food and other commercially 
        prepared non-whole prey foods may be harmful. Cat food 
        should be avoided for<i> all</i> animals (other than cats) 
        as it is very high in fat and other things that, depending 
        on the non-felid species it is fed to, can lead to a host 
        of other health problems. Healthy, prekilled rodents should 
        ultimately be the staple food source in your monitor's 
        regular diet. <a href="heplipidosis.html">Hepatic lipidosis</a> 
        due to a high fat diet and too little exercise is an all 
        too common disease - often a lethal one - in opportunistic 
        feeders like savannahs and so care must be taken to focus 
        the diet on whole prey other than as absolutely needed.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">You 
        can vary your savannah's diet with a variety of healthy 
        invertebrate prey, such as kingworms, crickets, the occasional 
        snail, etc. Too many wild-collected invertebrates, especially 
        snails, can result in smelly, loose stools that are likely 
        an artifact of the various parasites and other organisms 
        commonly found living in and on snails. There is also 
        the danger of any invertebrate you collect being contaminated 
        with any of the environmental toxins you or your neighbors 
        are using. Since toxins tend to bioaccumulate up the food 
        chain, the top predators are the ones who suffer. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Whether 
        you buy prey or collect or breed prey, you need to make 
        sure they healthy. Housing each species properly in clean, 
        uncrowded conditions, and feeding and hydrating them properly 
        is just as important for the dinner as it is for the diner.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Normally, 
        savannahs will not eat prey that is too big for them; 
        if they do, it is usually regurgitated soon after. While 
        this is not always harmful for the monitor (there is a 
        risk of irritation due to stomach acid and being scratched 
        by the prey's backward-facing teeth, claws and other sharp 
        bodyparts), it is an incredibly aromatic experience for 
        the keeper. Full grown monitors will eat full grown mice, 
        small rats and small hamsters if you can't find gerbils, 
        the latter being native to the savannah range. (Guinea 
        pigs should be avoided due their very thick-and difficult 
        to digest-skin and fur and their high fat content.) Venomous 
        snakes and a variety of other wildlife native to the savannah's 
        range are also on the wild savannah's diet. In captivity 
        we are, at best, able to feed but a pale imitation of 
        their natural diet. The trick is to make sure prey is 
        healthy, the right size, and that your slug-a-bed monitor 
        gets moving on a regular basis.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Feeding</font><br>
        </b> Savannahs will easily eat prekilled prey. If you 
        are using frozen prey, be sure to defrost it thoroughly 
        and warm it slightly before offering it to the monitor.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">For 
        safety's sake, offer monitors their prey by dangling it 
        from forceps or kitchen tongs. Wild caught lizards may 
        take some time to convert to a strictly rodent diet; in 
        the wild they have been found to consume a large variety 
        of invertebrates, other reptiles, small animals of many 
        types, snails, frogs, caterpillars, lizard eggs...even 
        baby tortoises.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        greatest period of growth is within the first two-three 
        hears, and this is the period when the greatest amount 
        of food will be required. Feed hatchlings (up to one foot 
        in length) one to four small mice or fuzzies (depending 
        upon the monitor's size) every two-three days. If they 
        were very emaciated and/or sick when you first got them, 
        along with the visit to your <a href="vets/index.html">reptile 
        veterinarian</a>, read the information in the <a href="emaciation.html">Emaciation 
        (Starvation) Protocol</a> article to help aid recovery 
        and get them through the initial weeks of acclimation 
        stress. Otherwise, stick to whole prey, and be sure to 
        time your invertebrate purchases so that you can house 
        and feed (and provide water to) the inverts, especially 
        crickets, for a day or so before you feed them out to 
        your monitor. Crickets can be offered as long as they 
        will go for them, using worms and pink mice (which come 
        in different sizes) for variety.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Juvenile/Subadults 
        (up to three feet in length) should be fed one to four 
        mice twice a week. Prekilled whole prey may be injected 
        with Nutri-Cal, Endura-Jel or other high calorie vitamin/mineral 
        paste or gel formulated for dogs and cats (gently heat 
        the gel to make it less stiff, then use a needle-less 
        syringe can be used to suck it up and shoot it down the 
        throat of killed prey.) for underweight youngsters or 
        those recovering from illness or injury. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Adults 
        (three or more feet in length) can be fed twice a week, 
        adjusted as necessary based on weight gain and amount 
        of exercise. Obesity in savannahs, a serious health condition 
        caused by improper husbandry, is all too common in captivity. 
        You will have to use your judgment, observing how the 
        monitor looks, taking into consideration the temperature 
        and amount of activity. Start with a couple of mice or 
        weanling rats a week.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Due 
        to a recent article that appeared in a herp hobbyist magazine, 
        there has been much discussion on captive diets for savannahs, 
        with many people unnecessarily - and possibly unadvisedly 
        - switching their adult savannahs from rodents to insects. 
        Michael Balsai and I recently discussed this matter; if 
        you are interested, I have made them available in an article 
        titled <a href="balsai.html">Michael Balsai on the Savannah 
        Monitor Diet</a>.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Water<br>
        </font></b>Despite some accounts, savannahs do enjoy soaking. 
        Provide them with a water bowl or tub big enough for them 
        to submerge themselves (they can stay under water for 
        extended periods of time). They will drink their water, 
        and may defecate in it, so the bowl must be checked at 
        least once a day to keep it clean and filled. Savannahs 
        are also handy at tipping over water tubs, so make sure 
        to use sturdy, bottom-heavy crocks or tubs.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Necessities<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
        things you should have on hand for general maintenance 
        and first aid include: Nolvasan (chlorhexidine diacetate) 
        for cleaning enclosures and disinfecting food and water 
        bowls, litter boxes, tubs and sinks etc. Betadine (povidone/iodine) 
        for cleansing scratches and wounds. Set aside a food storage 
        bowl, feeding and water bowls, soaking bowl or tub, even 
        sponges, to be used only for your monitor.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Routine 
        veterinary screening for newly acquired monitors is essential. 
        Many of the parasites infesting reptiles can be transmitted 
        to humans and other reptiles. Left untreated, such infestations 
        can ultimately kill your monitor. When your lizard first 
        defecates, collect the feces in a clean plastic bag, seal 
        it, label it with the date, your name and phone number 
        and the monitor's name, and take it and your monitor to 
        a vet who is experienced with reptiles. Ask that it be 
        tested for worms and protozoans, which are two different 
        tests. If either test is positive, your monitor will be 
        given medication given that you can repeat later at home. 
        Not all vets are trained to treat reptiles, and not all 
        reptile vets advertise themselves as such (and not all 
        vets advertising themselves as such are). Check my <a href="vets/index.html">Herp

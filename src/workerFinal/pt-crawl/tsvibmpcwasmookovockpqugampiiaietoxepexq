They loved your throat and quote unquote &quot;you&quot;
Hey, remember Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson really happened
Delta Echo Alpha Delta, walking on the moon forever

You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
That&#39;s being revised!
Even as we speak we&#39;re synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Even Katy Perry knows you&#39;re dead (Oh no)
Won&#39;t she be surprised!
When we get your heart to start tomorrow
When you see the chart tomorrow you&#39;ll be number one

Bro, you look amazing
Really put together
It&#39;s like you haven&#39;t aged a day, oh
It&#39;s like we know what we&#39;re doing or something

You&#39;ve been gone for way too long, like half a year
An entire career for some
Good luck getting into Heaven if you live past 27
Listen to the radiation put you back in circulation

You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
Oh, but you never died!
Even as we speak we&#39;re synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Ain&#39;t no cemetary you can&#39;t shed (Oh no)
Ain&#39;t nowhere you can hide!
Don&#39;t be frightened of us
Soon enough you&#39;re gonna love us, just remember

This is your last ride ever, forever
Fill up your lungs, feel better
Look, it&#39;s you, good as new
New hands, new throat, new living tissue
You earned this new purpose
Lifetime achievement award

Don&#39;t be nervous baby
We put a billion eyes back on you
From the grave to the stage
You&#39;re a natural, babe!

You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
That&#39;s being revised!
Even as we speak we&#39;re synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Even Katy Perry knows you&#39;re dead (Oh no)
Won&#39;t she be surprised!
When we get your heart to start tomorrow
When you see the chart tomorrow you&#39;ll be number one

I try to call you every day
I&#39;m rehearsing what to say when the truth comes out (Of my very own mouth)
I&#39;ve been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody&#39;s gonna hear me out
&#39;Cause I&#39;m the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I&#39;m the only one
On your A.M., A.M. radio

Oh, I&#39;m crying now, authentic tears
They flow out of me when I think about you
&#39;Cause you&#39;re the only person in the world who&#39;d understand
&#39;Cause you&#39;re the only person in the world who&#39;d understand the meaning of this
Oh My God
I try and I try and I try to make you listen to me

I try to call you every day
I&#39;m rehearsing what to say when the truth comes out (Of my very own mouth)
I&#39;ve been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody&#39;s gonna hear me out
&#39;Cause I&#39;m the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I&#39;m the only one, hey!
On your A.M., A.M. radio

Don&#39;t hang up yet, I&#39;m not done
I&#39;m an expert, I&#39;m the one
The one who was right all along
Better to be laughed at than wrong
I&#39;m an expert in my field
UFOlogy, yes, it&#39;s all real
Ancient aliens, it&#39;s all true
I&#39;m an expert just like you
And like you, I&#39;m a genius before my time
Disbelieving, that&#39;s the real crime
Pretty soon they&#39;ll discover me in the Super-Sargasso Sea

I try to call you every day
What can I say when the truth comes out? (Of my very own mouth)
I&#39;ve been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody&#39;s gonna hear me out
(Now, now, now)
&#39;Cause I&#39;m the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I&#39;m the only one
On your A.M., A.M. radio</div>

                    <div>The day they found me, I hadn&#39;t yet been played
Inside my workshop behind the old arcade
Electric desires had unraveled all my wires
Now I&#39;m in the box for safekeeping
The news reporters reported that I died
But all my organs were living on inside
Circuit board to brain with two lungs collecting change
One big human heart gently beeping

You can&#39;t win me, I can&#39;t be beat
I won&#39;t hurt you unless you cheat
You can&#39;t see me behind the screen
I&#39;m half human and half machine

Thank God for business, they let me take the floor
I stood so proudly, like I was going to war
Players soon appeared and I quickly was revered
This must be what love would have felt like
Such dedication, they came from miles away
With eyes so piercing, they&#39;d wait their turn to play
In perfect patient lines because I was in their minds
I could do whatever I felt like (Whatever I felt like)

You can&#39;t win me, I can&#39;t be beat
I won&#39;t hurt you unless you cheat
You can&#39;t see me behind the screen
I&#39;m half human and half machine

I&#39;m happy for years and years
And only eating the occasional maintenance man
Only driving a few kids to madness
Maybe they were predisposed to madness, who knows?
I only want to have fun
But now they&#39;re telling me my days here are done
&#39;Cause there&#39;s a little tiny box they make in Japan
And pretty soon it&#39;s gonna fit in your hand

It&#39;s getting lonely, it&#39;s getting hard to breathe
Ahe arcade&#39;s empty, I think it&#39;s Christmas Eve
Someone&#39;s broken in, now they&#39;re painting on my skin
Breaking me and taking my quarters
Bashing in my face with a crowbar
Kicking me and pushing me over
Now they see my blood on their sneakers

You can&#39;t win me, I can&#39;t be beat
I won&#39;t hurt you unless you cheat
You can&#39;t see me behind the screen
I&#39;m half human and half machine</div>

This is gonna change our world
Feeling how I feel, I&#39;ll accept the unreal
If you be my no-eyed girl from nowhere mankind can go
There&#39;s too much light, blinding white
Your matter tells mine to scatter
It&#39;s alright, it&#39;s alright

From the moment that we met
I&#39;ve been awake like I&#39;ve never been awake in all my life
If I spoke your language I could tell you how I feel
But your language isn&#39;t real
In every myth there&#39;s a little bit of truth
But I cannot say a thing (I cannot say a thing)
Without proof, oh no

Knowing what we know, knowing we do not know
This is gonna change our world
I might go insane if I hear your full name
If you be my no-eyed girl from nowhere mankind can go
There&#39;s too much light, blinding white
Emotions, human implosions
It&#39;s alright, it&#39;s alright

Right before the kiss I noticed something in the air
Molecules existed when there should have been none there
Chemical reactions with the surface of your skin
Some will say my actions let the no-eyed people in

And I&#39;d do it all again, and I&#39;d do it all again, and I&#39;d do it all again</div>

Turns out he left behind a mansion full of other people&#39;s skulls
The odd thing is, they never found his own, when he died
When he died
He somehow left behind strange symbols on the floor beneath his corpse
Investigators said the wood was scorched, when he died

When he died they found so many scorpions inside his lungs
When he died the statues of his missing children cried
What was later found to be his blood

When he died (On a dark and stormy night)
They telephoned his wife (Who reacted with delight)
But gradually her voice began to fade to nothing
And the Laughing Record played
The Laughing Record played

When he died
They found a message etched into his spine
That said when he died an endless age of untold nightmares would be nigh
And the blood would make the seas run red

When he died (On a dark and stormy night)
A nearby shed caught fire (It simply caught alight)
And when they cleared the charred wood from the ground
Inside they found a painting of a clown (A creepy painting of a clown)
He&#39;d painted it he was just a child
But scrawled upon the back was exactly when he died
When he died, when he died, when he died, when he died</div>

(A wisp of smoke man)
To waft over you and cloud up your view
So show me your hands and wave them right through a soft, fuzzy man

Although I have no arms to hold you in a human passion burns within me
I need to feel like I exist
So please baby please baby step into the mist

Don&#39;t be nervous
No, don&#39;t be nervous
I&#39;m not like other guys who have a surface
What you girls really need&#39;s a soft, fuzzy man
(An atmospheric man)
A shimmering puff of indistinct love
What&#39;s better than the vague embrace of a soft, fuzzy man?

Who seeps through your thoughts
Who makes you see spots
Who blows through the air
Who plays with your hair
I know it sounds crazy, but once you go hazy, you&#39;ll understand
I&#39;m your soft, fuzzy man</div>

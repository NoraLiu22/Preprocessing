<BR>Brief Overview on IRC
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>IRC is a multi-user online chatting system. It allows users to talk to other users all around the world via the Internet. This is done by connecting a client program (such as ircle for Mac or WSIRC for Windows) to a server. The port number used by IRC servers is usually 6667. 
<BR>
<BR>On IRC, users are identified by nicknames of their own choice. Nicknames may be at most 9 characters long. The nickname is set via the NICK command (/NICK yournick). If you choose a nickname already in use, you have to set a different nick. Some users have registered their nicknames with the NickServ database. If you get a message from NickServ that your nick is in use, please choose another.
<BR>
<BR>Communication on IRC is done via Channels and Private Messages. Channels have names starting with # (public channels) and & (local) and usually up to 12 characters long. You can see a list of the channels currently in use via the /LIST command. As soon as you join a channel with the /JOIN command, everything you type is sent to that channel and seen by all other users on that channel. You will see what the others type, respectively. If a channel doesn't exist it will be created as new.

<BR>WSIRC Help
<BR>
<BR>For WSIRC regular distribution of latest versions you can try these sites:
<BR>
<BR>USA: cs-ftp.bu.edu (/irc/clients/pc/windows/wsirc20.zip) USA: winftp.cica.indiana.edu (/pub/pc/win3/winsock/wsirc20.zip) USA: ftp.undernet.org (wsirc20.zip)
<BR>EUR: ftp.funet.fi (/pub/msdos/network/irc/windows/wsirc20.zip) COMPUSERVE: INETFORUM, TELECOM, WUGNET (WSIRC.ZIP) 
<BR>
<BR>First, you must extract the .zip files, then you must be running MS-Windows. WSIRC is MS-Windows based software. 
<BR>
<BR>Dial up your internet service provider to your SLIP account. 
<BR>
<BR>Once connected, start up WSIRC. Open up the 'Options | Server' dialog box and enter all information in the boxes provided. For server names, browse the SERVERS.TXT file and choose the server. Do not use the actual IP address (123.222.222.222) use the human text name (irc.funet.fi). Use port 6667. Use nicknames that are NO LONGER than 9 characters. Use no spaces in between for anything.
<BR>
<BR>Click on the connect button (or use File | Connect). If it doesn't connect, try another server. If 11004 error occurs, you entered an invalid server name, enter a valid server name. If 10060 or 10061 occurs, either the server is down, busy or otherwise not responding, try another server. If the server says "Nickname in use", change your nickname on the fly with '/NICK newnick'. The server should then displays its MOTD (Message of the day) file.
<BR>
<BR>Once connected to the irc server, you can join a channel immediately e.g. by tiping '/JOIN #chat' to join the #chat channel. Channels on irc always begin with the '#' character. A Channel Window should pop up, if not check your nickname to see that is 9 character or less.
<BR>
<BR>Once in the channel, type anything you want. It's usually common courtesy to simple say 'Hello all' to see if anybody is there and friendly. Some channels are 'behaviorally challenging', if so simply join another channel or create your own. To leave a channel type /LEAVE or /PART or close the Channel Window.
<BR>

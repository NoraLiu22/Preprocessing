<p align="left">
The Miller Center at the University of Virginia has received a three-year National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to make presidential materials more accessible. The world of presidential materials is vast, with many different types of resources located in a wide variety of libraries, museums, and sites. The Miller Center is working to develop a website that will give users one centralized place to search across digital collections on the U.S. presidents.
</p>

<p align="left">
Connecting Presidential Collections ("CPC", <a href="http://presidentialcollections.org/">http://presidentialcollections.org/</a>) was created as a test site last year as part of a planning grant from the IMLS. The initial partners included the Massachusetts Historical Society (home to President John Adams's papers), The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, the Theodore Roosevelt Center at Dickinson State University, and the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum. This subsequent IMLS grant will allow the Miller Center to finalize the website and add more partner collections.
</p>


<p align="left">
To be included in the CPC website, partner organizations submit metadata about their collections That data is then aggregated using Solr as the search index and Blacklight as the front-end user interface. Users can then use the site to search across collections and click through to partner organizations' websites when they find digital objects they would like to see. The goal is to simplify the search process for users while simultaneously increasing the exposure of these valuable collections.
</p>

<p align="left">
In addition, the Miller Center will work with potential partners whose collections are not yet ready to be included in CPC. After identifying the range of challenges that might prevent an organization from participating, the Miller Center plans to create a video library of workshops to help organizations prepare their collections for inclusion. The goal of this video library is to address general issues that organizations might face when attempting to create or improve their digital collections.
</p>

<p align="left">
The Connecting Presidential Collections grant project also includes the creation of a comprehensive collection-level catalog of presidential materials that will help researchers and librarians by laying out the location of presidential materials (such as letters, manuscripts, publications, artwork, possessions, home sites, and many others).  
</p>

<p align="left">
The final part of this project involves presidential papers that are currently available only on microfilm. Although many microfilm collections have been digitized, the resulting products are often only a pile of images with little metadata to guide the user to valuable content. Working with three collections of presidential papers, the Miller Center will experiment with ways to create document-level metadata using technical tools and existing finding aids and indexes. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The overall goal of Connecting Presidential Collections is two-fold: to simplify the landscape of presidential materials (making it easier for librarians, scholars, and researchers to navigate those historical resources), and to collaborate with presidential sites and libraries to raise the visibility of their valuable, and too often hidden, collections.

The <a href="http://www.library.unh.edu/">University of New Hampshire Library</a> and its partner, the <a href="http://www.csrc.sr.unh.edu/">Earth Systems Research Center</a>, have been awarded a grant in the amount of $474,156 from the Institute for Museum and Library Services, National Leadership Grants for Libraries Program (Grant Award Number: LG-05-13-0350-13) to build PLACE, the Position-based Location Archive Coordinate Explorer.  PLACE will be a geospatial search interface that will use embedded geospatial coordinates to enable easier discovery of information that can be difficult to locate through text based searching. Through PLACE, via a click or delineation of a search polygon on a web map, users will zoom to a region and will locate all <a href="http://www.library.unh.edu/digital/">UNH Library Digital Collections</a> objects whose geographic extents intersect.  Initially, PLACE will provide access to geographic collections focused on the region, but it will be flexible and expandable as collections grow. The project will provide users with access to these collections through a flexible visual interface and provide a toolkit for other institutions to implement in their geospatial collections. Ready access to embedded geospatial information in a flexible visual interface will contribute to the development of 21st-century skills by library users, such as visual, global, and environmental literacy.
</p>

<p align="left">
The project will contribute to two open source communities: <a href="http://opengeoportal.org/">Open Geoportal</a> (OGP) and <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/">Fedora</a>.  Tasks to accomplish our goals include creating standards compliant metadata for prototype collections and ingesting digital objects into Fedora, purchasing and configuring a dedicated server for our instance of OGP, and integrating OGP with the Fedora <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> index to provide a basic level of OGP functionality.  We will build new tools not currently available in Geoportal using Jscript and Jquery. The universal gazetteer tool will involve a common library of polygons, such as county boundaries, which will be available via pull down lists.  Time series data is important for assessing changes over time: a cross reference table and a time slider on the interface will make it easier for users to select datasets by time periods.  We plan usability studies throughout the project to optimize interface design, and enhancements for providing geospatial access to the unique geological fieldtrip guidebook literature, a feature supported in our needs analysis.</p>

<p align="left">
The history of African American theater, from its earliest influences to its current artists and thinkers, is not common knowledge. It is not taught in public schools and is not part of university curricula in a systematic or sustained way. The political and cultural histories from which African American artistic and intellectual traditions arise are too often elided, overlooked, or misrepresented. As a result, many of the choices made by African American theater companies &#150; from play selection to set and costume design to artistic direction &#150; take place within a context that is often obscured.
</p>

<p align="left">
The question of context is important for all theaters but is especially pointed for African American theaters. Hundreds of years of African American theater history has been consistently under-documented, at the same time that theaters themselves, both historically and in our own time, face precarious futures and can close under duress, their archives unsaved and their memories dispersed or disappeared. Of the 200 theater groups borne of the Black Arts Movement in the 1970s, only ten still exist, with Penumbra Theatre in St. Paul being the largest. Lou Bellamy, Penumbra's founding Artistic Director, has echoed August Wilson's perspective that black artists have an added pressure to "mark their passing on the road." Archives provide a means to make that mark through the documentation of a rich history that is at a heightened risk of being lost.
</p>

<p align="left">
The University of Minnesota Libraries' African American Theater History Project seeks to address the need for a deeper understanding of the historical, cultural, and political contexts that inform African American performing arts by improving the accessibility of a national collection of openly available archival materials.  A 2013 grant from the <a href="http://www.imls.gov">Institute of Museum and Library services</a> will enable the development of a shareable online search tool of digitized and born digital archival materials that can live on any website, and will aggregate openly available metadata to provide cross-institutional access to content from the collections of leading institutions such as the Digital Public Library of America, Library of Congress, New York Public Library, Tulane University's Amistad Center, and the Smithsonian.
</p>

 
<p align="left">
Led by the University of Minnesota's Performing Arts Archives and Givens Collection of African American Literature, in partnership with Penumbra Theatre Company, the project team will work with theater professionals, libraries, and museums to identify extant archival material relevant to African American theater and the cultural history that inspires it. The African American Theater History Project will also work to add content to the Digital Public Library of America to deepen its collection of African American cultural-historical materials.

<p align="left">
<i>Mediterranean Open Access Network</i> (<a href="http://www.medoanet.eu">MedOANet</a>) is an FP7 project funded by the Science in Society scheme and running from December 2011 until November 2013. MedOANet was designed to strengthen national open access initiatives and to facilitate the development of coordinated policies in six Mediterranean European countries: Greece, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and Turkey.
</p>

<p align="left">
The project was designed along three lines of work: mapping the open access ecosystem in the six countries, facilitating national coordination and facilitating regional coordination among these countries.
</p>

<p align="left">
Three surveys in the six countries, one each among research funding organizations (RFOs), research performing organizations (RPOs) and publishers, helped obtain a nuanced understanding of the processes and structures in place regarding Open Access, as well as relevant quantitative and qualitative data, in view of supporting the development of coordinated open access policies aligned with the European mandates in project countries. The results of the surveys are under publication. Further, MedOANet developed an online tool, the Open Access Tracker that tracks the development of open access policies and initiatives (funder policies, repositories etc.). The Tracker is the first online tool to bring together in one place in the web information from various international registries to profile each country.
</p>

<p align="left">
National coordination activities was aimed at enabling each of the six countries to move towards nationally coordinated agendas on open access. The project partners engaged national policymakers, developed national task forces and organized national workshops, bringing stakeholders together, sometimes for the first time. These activities strengthened national coordination and helped the countries situate themselves in the wider context of European policy developments in view of alignment.
</p>

<p align="left">
Regional and European coordination activities expanded on the former two strands of work: A European workshop and an international conference intensified coordinated policymaker and stakeholder engagement at the regional and European level. The MedOANet Final Conference provided a unique opportunity to explore the very important developments that have taken place in the last couple of years in terms of open access policies in Europe. The aim of the conference was to present the results of the project and place them in their wider European context.
</p>

<p align="left">
The conference included an impressive  line-up of international and Greek speakers and was of particular interest to research policy-makers, such as research funders and research performing institution administrators, specialists on open access, students and interested individuals to explore current trends in Open Access in Greece and Europe.
</p>

<p align="left">
M&#225;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science opened the conference with a videotaped message, while the conference focused on the following topics through dedicated sessions: 
</p>


<ul type="disc">
	<li>The implementation of national policies for open access to scientific information with a focus on Mediterranean Europe and open access and its role in the European Research Area (ERA) </li>
	<li class="spacetop">The implementation of open access policies for Research Funders, best practices and experiences</li>
	<li class="spacetop">The implementation of open access among research performing organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">
The project culminates with the MedOANet Guidelines for implementing open access policies. They provide concise and targeted advice for coordinated policy development and are directed to RPO and RFO policymakers. More specifically, the guidelines present the main concepts and issues with respect to open access, discuss the major steps that are necessary in the process of policy development, present the important components of an institutional and funder policy, model policies for RPOS and RFOs, as well as best practices in policy development. The guidelines are publishes in all six languages of the six countries and English.
</p>

<p align="left">
The MedOANet Guidelines recommend:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Immediate self-archiving in repositories to be required upon acceptance for publication (author final version or publisher version)</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Immediate open access to metadata and to full-text research outputs if possible </li>
	<li class="spacetop">Immediate open access to full-text outputs with up to 6 months embargo periods (12 for SSH) for research funders</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Peer-reviewed research covered by the policy, especially journal articles, conference proceedings books/monographs</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Mandatory character of policy, with compliance checked. Authoritative publication lists from institutions derived only from repositories</li>
	<li class="spacetop">Minimally recommend that researchers deposit research data that underpin publications in repositories and formulate separate policies.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>November 13, 2013 &#151; &quot;CrossRef announced today that more
than 270,000 documents now have CrossMark version status information,
and most display the distinctive logo that provides researchers
information both about existing changes to scholarly articles and about
important publication record information. More than 100,000 of these
records were added in the month of October alone. Scholars click on
CrossMark records displayed on PDF and HTML articles an average of
50,000 times a month.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;CrossRef accepted its first CrossMark data from publishers
eighteen months ago. In that time, the number of participating
publishers has grown to 24 from the small group that led the two-year
pilot. The publishers with the highest number of CrossMark records
include those from the original pilot, such as Elsevier Science, the
International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), the American Institute of
Physics, The Royal Society, and Wiley. Wiley currently has the highest
number of reader views (or clicks) per CrossMark record.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Participants who have joined since the original pilot are also
contributing large numbers of CrossMark records. For example Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), deposited almost 50,000
CrossMark records since mid-October. Another publisher that joined the
program this year, F1000 Research, uses the optional CrossMark record
tab to deposit and display reviewer reports.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Planning for Preservation Storage
</p>

<p>October 30, 2013 blog posting by Leslie Johnston, Library of Congress &#151; &quot;Every year the Library of Congress hosts a meeting on Designing Storage Architectures for Digital Collections, aka the Preservation Storage Meeting.  The 2013 meeting was held September 23-24, and featured an impressive array of presentations and discussions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The theme this year was standards. The term applies not just to media or to hardware, but to interfaces as well. In preservation, it is the interfaces &#150; the software and operating system mechanisms through which users and tools interact with stored files &#150; that disappear the most quickly. Or change the least to keep up with changing needs.  The quote of the meeting for me was from Henry Newman of Instrumental, Inc:  'These are not new problems, only new engineers solving old problems.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Library of Congress staff kicked off the meeting by discussing some of the Library's infrastructure and needs. The Library is recording its files in its inventory service, which includes fixities for future auditing.  We have a wide range of needs, though, which vary with the type of content.  The data center where preservation and access copies of text and images are primarily stored manages millions of files in 10s of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Petabyte&amp;oldid=576556955">petabytes</a>. The data center where preservation and access copies of video and audio are primarily stored manages approximately 700k files in 10s of PB. The different scales of file numbers and sizes mean different requirements for the hardware needed to stage and deliver this content. In terms of the Library's storage purchases, 30% is purely for capacity expansion, and 70% is for the ongoing refresh of technology, which often also includes adding capacity....&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>October 28, 2013 &#151; &quot;New York University's Fales Library and Special Collections, a leader in envisioning new types of collecting to support new categories of research, presents a panel discussion, 'Wither Collecting? New Visions for Special Collections in the 21st Century,' on November 20, 2013 at 6:30pm, Fales Library, third floor, Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, 70 Washington Square South, (at LaGuardia Place). [Subways A,C,E, B,D,M to West 4th Street; 6 line to Astor Place; R train to 8th Street.].&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The panel, composed of leading thinkers in the field of special collections, will share their thoughts about how special collections are and can be developed in the 21st century, as librarians look at new kinds of collecting to support new kinds of research, especially in area studies, post-structuralism, institutional critique, the death of the author, and other postmodern modes of criticism.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">New NDSA Report on Geospatial Data
</p>

<p>October 24, 2013 blog posting by Butch Lazorchak, Library of Congress &#151; &quot;Digital mapping information is an essential part of the backbone of our economy through the now-widespread consumer applications that allow us to track our location, find a nearby restaurant or guide us on a journey. While largely invisible to the casual user, the geospatial data that underpins these applications allows us to know what our landscape looks like at this instant, and increasingly, to see where we've been at a level of previously unimagined detail.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;While these tools are clearly incredibly valuable, it's not entirely clear how we manage and preserve the equally valuable geospatial data that underpins the applications to ensure that we have the ability to analyze changes to our landscape over time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With that in mind, we are pleased to announce the release of a new National Digital Stewardship Alliance report, "<a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/working_groups/documents/NDSA_AppraisalSelection_report_final102413.pdf?loclr=blogsig">Issues in the Appraisal and Selection of Geospatial Data</a>"....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The report provides an illuminating background on the problem area, then suggests ways to establish criteria for appraisal and selection decisions for geospatial data. It then proposes some models and processes for appraisal and selection, including tools for the identification and evaluation of data resources and triggers for appraisal and selection,  and finishes with further questions for the community to explore.&quot;</p>

One of the conclusions of OAPEN-NL, a project exploring Open Access monograph publishing in the Netherlands. OAPEN-NL's final report, published yesterday, gives recommendations for research funders, libraries, publishers and authors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.oapen.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=63">OAPEN-NL</a> builds on the <a href="http://www.oapen.org/">European OAPEN-project</a> which was set up to gain experience with Open Access publishing of academic books. OAPEN-NL was supported by NWO, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research, and the Ministry of OCW via the National PRIMA-subsidy program. The project was conducted by OAPEN Foundation, in collaboration with NWO, SURF and nine academic publishers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In total 50 academic books were published in Open Access with subsidy from NWO. For every Open Access title, the publishers provided a similar title that was published in the conventional way for comparison. Research showed that publishing in Open Access had no effect whatever on the sale of books. The publisher's fear that book sales would decline if publications would be available in Open Access, was unfounded. However, online usage of books in Open Access increased considerably as did online discovery of these books. Although online usage increased, this did not (yet) lead to an increase of citations in the research timeframe.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">CLIR Receives Mellon Grant for Postdoctoral Fellowships in Data Curation for Early Modern Studies
</p>

<p>October 21, 2013 &#151; &quot;The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has awarded the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) $916,000 to support a program of Postdoctoral Fellowships in Data Curation for Early Modern Studies. The program will fund a cohort of five fellows for two years at five institutions of higher learning, starting in September 2014.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The fellowships are designed to help build the professional capacity needed for sound data management practice in Early Modern Studies. Fellows will be scholarly practitioners who not only understand the nature and processes of the disciplines broadly defined as the humanities, but also how research data are organized, transmitted, manipulated, reused, and sustained.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For this program, <i>Early Modern Studies</i> encompasses the historical period from about 1450 to 1800, focusing on humanistic research in literary studies, history, art and architectural history, philosophy, religion, music and other performing arts, languages and linguistics, and related fields of study....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...This program complements the CLIR/DLF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Data Curation for the Sciences and Social Sciences, launched in 2012 with support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Postdoctoral Fellowships in Data Curation for Medieval Studies, initiated last year with funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>October 21, 2013 blog posting by Trevor Owens, Library of Congress &#151; &quot;Our world increasingly runs on software. From operating streetlights and financial markets, to producing music and film, to conducting research and scholarship in the sciences and the humanities, software shapes and structures our lives.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Software is simultaneously a baseline infrastructure and a mode of creative expression. It is both the key to accessing and making sense of digital objects and an increasingly important historical artifact in its own right. When historians write the social, political, economic and cultural history of the 21st century they will need to consult the software of the times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am thrilled to announce the release of a new National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program report, <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/multimedia/documents/PreservingEXE_report_final101813.pdf?loclr=blogsig">Preserving.exe: Toward a National Strategy for Preserving Software</a>, including perspectives from individuals working to ensure long term access to software.&quot;</p>

<i><b>An author-choice option for optics and photonics research in SPIE journals is meeting an increased need for open access publication</b></i>
</p>


<p>October 18, 2013 &#151; &quot;An author-choice open access publishing program for journals launched this year by <a href="http://spie.org/">SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics</a>, is gaining strong participation from authors and increasing the volume of freely accessible, peer-reviewed optics and photonics research literature as a result.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'More than six times as many authors are choosing open-access publication in <a href="http://spie.org/JournalsOA">SPIE journals</a> since the launch of our 'gold' open access program at the beginning of this year,' said Eric Pepper, SPIE Director of Publications. 'In less than 10 months, we have seen the number rise from 5% to more than 30% of all new articles published in SPIE journals.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The SPIE program allows authors to have their journal articles open access immediately on publication in the <a href="http://spiedigitallibrary.org/">SPIE Digital Library</a>, with payment of modest voluntary page charges, Pepper explained. In addition, authors choosing this program retain copyright through a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons</a> CC-BY license.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>October 17, 2013 &#151; &quot;The extensive literary manuscripts and archives of Gwendolyn E. Brooks (1917-2000), Illinois Poet Laureate and the first African American writer to win the Pulitzer Prize, are now part of the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The archive, spans more than six decades, and includes some of Brooks's earliest surviving poetry and prose written when she was a teenager, as well as early scrapbooks and clippings of pieces she published as a young woman in The Chicago Defender. In addition, the archive contains extensive correspondence, manuscripts, and informal jottings, annotations, and observations. The largest portion of Brooks's archive documents her career after leaving mainstream commercial publishing to produce her works with small presses and black-owned imprints, including her own imprint The David Company.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brooks preserved drafts and notes for her outgoing letters alongside the letters she received. The list of her regular correspondents includes a significant roster of mid-century African-American writers and poets. A lifelong Chicagoan, her circle also includes many important figures associated with that city.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>September 30, 2013 &#151; &quot;Oxford University Press (OUP) is joining OAPEN-UK, a collaborative research project exploring open access (OA) scholarly monograph publishing in the humanities and social sciences.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OAPEN-UK is co-funded by Jisc and the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and is gathering data in order to help funders, authors, publishers and institutions make informed decisions on the future of OA monographs. The project is working in an area where little research exists, and is working to connect with all the key stakeholders to identify and discuss concerns, challenges, perceptions and opportunities relating to a transition to open access monographs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OAPEN-UK recognises that open access will require changes to current working practices as well as cultural change, and that resistance to change is inevitable. By working with each stakeholder and sharing findings between them, the project promotes understanding and knowledge, and enables stakeholders to make informed decisions based on evidence, rather than assumptions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OAPEN-UK marks OUP's first move into the developing world of open access scholarly monographs.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>September 23, 2013 &#151; &quot;Scotland and Wales have started to undergo work to develop shared library IT systems across their higher education institutions thanks to initial funding and support from Jisc.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ultimately, this will provide students access to information hosted at all institutions, opening up a wealth of teaching and learning materials. There will also be cost saving opportunities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Higher education institutions in Wales are currently joining with the National Library of Wales to start development of a joint procurement process for a shared library management system. The shared system will open up potential opportunities for collaboration on other levels &#150; including the possibility of reciprocal borrowing across the libraries and shared cataloguing of collections. They are looking to have these systems in place by summer 2015 - 2016 and a tender for the work will be going out in the New Year.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Planning for data management enables sound handling of research data
</p>

<p>September 13, 2013 &#151; &quot;Researchers have gained first-hand experience of making a data management plan (DMP) to properly manage their research data. Working with research support staff and SURF, they have come up with plans that can serve as examples for others. DMPs are increasingly required by funders as part of grant applications.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The data management plans (DMPs) were set up by research groups at four universities, one university of applied sciences, and a research institute. Three organisations recently released their DMP and made it available as an example. Two of these data management plans (DMPs) are a template for gathering researchers' requirements on how to manage their data. The third DMP is an example of descriptions in accordance with the standards of the database used....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...A template or sample DMP can be useful when writing a data management plan. Previous experience and expertise in making a DMP also speed up the process. Researchers are advised to start thinking about how to handle research data from the start of a research project. Writing a DMP provides structure to that thought process.&quot;</p>

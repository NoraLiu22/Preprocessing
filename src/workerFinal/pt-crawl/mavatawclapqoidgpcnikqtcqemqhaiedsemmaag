      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">&quot;Snake usually 
        tend to maintain lower body temperatures than do lizards from the same 
        geographical area, and tropical reptiles generally have less tolerance 
        for low temperatures than those from temperate regions. Some reptiles, 
        especially, tropical forest dwellers, may not display heat-avoidance behavior. 
        Do not, therefore, expose these reptiles to basking spots where temperatures 
        would rise above their selected body temperature. Keep all heating devices 
        on the cage exterior to prevent accidental burns. I do not favor heating 
        devices that require animals to make contact for warmth. Such devices 
        do not increase the surrounding temperature, but provide dangerously localized 
        heat on an animal. Reptiles can suffer burns before they become aware 
        that they have been injured when thermostats are set to high or when they 
        fail altogether. Conversely, thermostats that fail may produce no heat 
        at all, and tropical forest dwellers may develop respiratory problems 
        when temperatures fall below the range that is best for them.&quot;</font></p>

        appeared in a series of posts in rec.pets.herp that got into discussing 
        hot rocks and the fact that they are not suitable for all reptiles, especially 
        iguanas. He was unable to explain, even though he acknowledged that hot 
        rocks were inappropriate for use with green iguanas, why Zoo Med's advertising 
        and packaging all shows iguanas sitting on hot rocks.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">&quot;Finally, I understand 
        your views on rock heaters and yes, it would be nice to put lists of appropriate 
        animals on every product out there. It would also be nice if everyone 
        out there with a reptile were properly educated before they obtained their 
        animal and were interested in going to all lengths to obtain this knowledge 
        instead of listening to the pet shop selling iguanas for $9.99 or giving 
        them away for free with the purchase of a 10 gal. tank (please, no offense 
        meant).</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">&quot;95% of all rock 
        heater burn complaints I have ever heard or received in my 20+ years experience 
        with reptiles was the result of using them inappropriately as primary 
        heat sources. They are not meant to have an animals body covering up their 
        surface for extended periods of time. [Worse] yet, people cover them up 
        with socks or pillow cases; this causes the heat to become encapsulated 
        and is a good way to burn your house down! All items that produce heat 
        have the ability to produce a burn. Were exactly is the line between manufacturer 
        liability and consumer responsibility?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align=left> </p>
      <p align="left"></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">The subject of hot 
        rocks and their appropriateness for use with green iguanas was hotly discussed 
        on the AOL Pets Green Iguana forum during the summer of 2000. Henry Lizardlover, 
        who has advocated the use of hot rocks for green iguanas, finally contacted 
        Zoo Med himself. He wrote to me on 09/02/00, summarizing what he heard 
        back from Zoo Med:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">I just received a 
          letter back to me from the Director of Consumer Relations and he stated 
          that Zoo Med does not officially say that Rock heaters are not appropriate 
          for Green Iguanas, but that Rock heaters should never be used as a primary 
          or secondary heat source for Green Iguanas. Zoo Med also recommends 
          the Deluxe Rock heater with built in Rheostat for any large lizards 
          or snakes to ensure their safety when they cannot fit their entire bodies 
          over the heat rocks.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">So, again, the leading 
        manufacturer of hot rocks says that they are not appropriate for green 
        iguanas, whether used alone as the sole source of heat, or as a secondary 
        source of heat, as in conjunction with room heaters or basking lights. 
        Zoo Med apparently can't leave well enough alone, however, missing the 
        point that, if a major part of the reptile's body is cold, laying with 
        part of the body on a heat source, whether or not it has a working thermostat, 
        is not an appropriate way to heat a reptile. Please see the <a href="#warwick">Wawick-Arena</a>

        issue of Reptiles magazine.</font></p>
      <p> <i><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">What is your position 
        on the use of heat rocks for captive snakes? My local herpetoculturist/store

        LJ., Connecticut</font></i></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"> As I start pondering 
        the response to your letter, I'm thinking to myself, &quot;What does the 
        idea of substrate heating resemble in nature that snakes would normally 
        utilize?&quot; Unless we're using the odd example of a species that inhabits 
        an area with subterranean steam vents or other such rare phenomena, where 
        would most snakes ever have 24-hour access to a toasty warm spot on which 
        to pass their time digesting a meal?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"> The closest analogy 
        to heat rocks is a serpent basking on a warm road surface (or a sun-warmed 
        rock) as its environment cools after dark. This might be a cozy solution 
        for a few hours at best (and if no cars are coming down the road!). Eventually, 
        though, the animal may have to tolerate some chilling before morning.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">The sun is the chief 
        source of heat, mostly in the direct form while radiating heat down from 
        above. Snakes, and many other herps, have learned to adapt to this by 
        developing routines of basking behavior to maximize the sun effectively. 
        Many move into it for awhile in the morning, until they reach their desired 
        temperature level for activity. During the rest of the day, diurnal species 
        move in and out of shade to maintain the proper temperature levels. Even 
        nocturnal snakes with meals in their stomachs may spend part of the day 
        in this manner to assist digestive efficiency, knowing that the heat gets 
        &quot;switched off' at night. They simply don't have the option of keeping 
        a perfect temperature all the time, and they've obviously evolved to be 
        capable of handling it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Artificial substrate 
        heating came about as a convenient heat choice because the lack of such 
        options in captivity is the norm. This method is effective for people 
        who aren't able to maintain an ambient temperature high enough for heatloving 
        reptiles that may be kept, for instance, in northern basements during 
        the winter. Heating of this kind creates a warm spot in an otherwise cold 
        cage, so digestion can occur, or simply so the herp doesn't have to endure 
        uncomfortable or dangerous temperatures.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Heat rocks, pads and 
        tapes are particularly handy when the goal is to keep a large number of 
        specimens in rows of tanks or plastic boxes. This type of heating may 
        be more economical than raising the ambient temperature of a large holding 
        area, and it gives a range across the cage. ICs especially suited to offering 
        heat to growing juveniles that may be sharing the same room with adults 
        that you wish to cool for breeding. It can also speed digestion in sick 
        animals.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Substrate heat is more 
        effective for terrestrial species than arboreal ones, although I did see 
        a new heating device at a show which incorporated heat cable into an artificial 
        tree limb to accommodate arboreal herps.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">For snakes, I prefer 
        overhead lamps that more closely mimic the sun as heat sources in cages 
        where its feasible to use them. They can be aimed at chosen sites to tempt 
        snakes into comfortable, yet easily viewed, places in their cages. Simple 
        spotlights, especially with directional hoods, can be set up over the 
        ends of cages to give the inhabitants the choice of either basking under 
        them or avoiding them by staying at the darker side of their enclosures. 
        Controlled by timers, lights such as this can be set to coincide with 
        the local conditions, offering a seasonal photoperiod in which natural 
        basking (thermoregulation) is also possible. Healthy herps should continue 
        to thrive when exposed to slightly suboptimal temperatures overnight, 
        as long as they can obtain as much heat as desired during the daytime.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">Although substrate heat 
        can be valuable, I believe that snakes can better judge the warmth they 
        need from heat coming down from above, rather than from heat rising up 
        through their bellies at night, when it normally wouldn't be available 
        at all. Captivity subjects animals to stresses that we're only beginning 
        to fully comprehend, and keeping snakes at abnormally warm temperatures 
        may be just as adverse as letting them get too cold. This may be why certain 
        diseases and/or parasites that are normally held in check by the course 
        of daily activity in the wild may gain the upper hand in captive animals.</font></p>

      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">&quot;Historically, 
        the hot rock has been the most misused heating source. It should never 
        be used as the primary heat source. Hot rocks are made of clay, cement 
        or hard plastic molded or formed around an electric resistor (heating 
        coil). As the electric coil heats up, so does the surrounding mold. The 
        reptile is expected to crawl on or coil around this rock and maintain 
        its body temperature. These rocks do not heat the captive environment.; 
        therefore, a reptile housed in a terrarium heated only with a hot rock 
        will not have the proper warmth to meet its metabolic requirements and 
        may receive sever e burns. Hot rocks are only effective when buried under 
        the substrate an used as a secondary heat source. Most do not have any 
        built-in means to control their temperature output, resulting in an &quot;all 
        or none&quot; heating system. Although these have somewhat standardized 
        construction, they typically vary in size and heat production. What may 
        be an appropriate size and temperature for a large python may be dangerously 
        hot for a small kingsnake. Likewise, a small, buried hot rock suitable 
        as a secondary heat source for a small snake would be less effective for 
        a large-bodied snake. Hot rocks are also notorious for having surface 
        &quot;hot spots&quot; that can reach such high temperatures that severe 
        thermal burns can result. Hot rocks are suitable only for ground dwelling 
        species of snakes and must be insulated from the live animal.&quot;</font></p>

        Warwick, Fredric L. Frye, and James B. Murphy, eds. Chapman &amp; Hall, 
        London. 1996. pp. 263-283).</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">&quot;An example of 
        apparent but almost certainly misunderstood physical insensitivity and 
        poor thermal environments concerns thermal burns, which occur when captive 
        reptiles come into direct contact with heat sources while attempting to 
        raise their body temperature to preferred levels. The general problem 
        may be exacerbated somewhat by ambient temperatures that are too low and 
        which result in animals being forced to raise their body temperature through 
        extreme proximity to heat sources (J.B. Murphy, pers. comm.). Damage from 
        thermal burns ranges from minor lesions and scarring of the skin to extensive 
        injury such as fusion of the eyelids or burns that extend deep into the 
        body tissues (Frye, 1991a). These injuries may lead to permanent defacement, 
        disability or death.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">&quot;The point of 
        particular interest here is that the individual may appear to be oblivious 
        to gross trauma during the period of damaging injury, and in fact insensitive 
        to pain. One current view is that these burns arise after an animal has 
        rested against an inactive heat source, which is then activated and beats 
        up rapidly, causing tissue and presumably local neural damage (Frye, 1991a). 
        Anecdotal accounts suggest that reptiles also settle on already active 
        heat sources and then suffer burns. We propose that a major reason for 
        this behaviour is twofold. First, a large reptile may not be able to attain 
        an optimal body temperature from a small intense heat source such as a 
        lamp. Second, thermal provisions in captivity fail to simulate adequately 
        the thermal diversity of the natural environment.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">&quot;In nature the 
        thermal requirements of, for example, a heliotherm are satisfied by a 
        radiant solar source which bathes the entire animal with heat. However, 
        the efficiency with which a body absorbs warmth depends on not only its 
        own properties but also other factors including the intensity of the heat 
        source, the position of the body with respect to the heat source and the 
        proximity and properties of other reflective surfaces (Geiger, 1959). 
        Thus a thermally receptive body is subject to thermal inputs of a multidimensional 
        and heterogeneous nature. Different regions of a reptile's body have different 
        absorbency spectra and thus different heating rates (Heatwole and Taylor, 
        1987). In captivity, often the only source of heat available is one or 
        two small and usually intense heat lamps. In order to raise their body 
        temperature, reptiles move toward a heat source and bask. Especially where 
        large reptile species and individuals are involved, with associated slower 
        blood circulation (Coulson and Coulson, 1986) and thus heat dispersal, 
        these animals must attempt to raise the temperature of the entire body 
        using primarily diminutive heat sources. Thermal absorption is attempted 
        while continually losing warmth from body surfaces that are not exposed 
        to the heat source and which may, indeed, be in contact with 'cold' surfaces 
        that conduct heat away from animals.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">&quot;Compensatory 
        behaviour may include moving closer to the heat source where upon the 
        peripheral nerve endings are damaged and desensitized. Once this occurs, 
        the reptile moves closer still and eventually contacts the heat source 
        in an attempt to raise its body temperature to an optimal level, a point 
        it may never achieve. Thus an unnatural thermal environment and related 
        'biological confusion' may result in thermal burns. Clearly, more data 
        are needed to clarify the reasons behind this aberrant behaviour, especially 
        in consideration of body size and associated heating requirements of reptiles. 
        If this hypothesis were supported, heliotherms of a small body size in 
        particular, would be less likely to suffer thermal burns because a heat 
        lamp is, to them, a relatively expansive source that may more appropriately 
        'saturate' their bodies entirely.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif">&quot;Related considerations 
        include the fact that large lizards are more reflective of solar radiation 
        than smaller individuals (Norris, 1967) and that they heat and cool at 
        a slower rate as a result of a low ratio of surface area to volume. Snakes, 
        by the very nature of their morphology, may be compromised by inadequate 
        thermal provisions.&quot;</font> </p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Caveat 
        Emptor<br>
        </i> </b>On the one hand, we have product manufacturers who expect the 
        customer to buy their products based on the text and illustrations that 
        appear in print media and on their packages. These product developers 
        and manufacturers tout the research that supposedly goes into the development 
        and improvements of their products. This research and development is used 
        as a selling point to convince pet stores to buy the product and, through 
        advertising, the consumer to search out those products.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The pet 
        stores in turn use this marketing rhetoric to convince consumers to buy 
        the product. The consumer, thinking that there is indeed valid research 
        behind the product and that pet stores wouldn't sell products about which 
        they know nothing, assume that the product manufacturers are producing 
        safe products to be used as described and pictured on the packaging, in 
        advertisements, and on their websites, which are in turn being sold to 
        them by the supposed experts in the stores.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, at 
        the same time, the product manufacturers claim that it is the <i>consumers</i> 
        fault if the consumers believe what they read and see and are told by 
        the pet stores, or read or deduce from the manufacturers' or sellers' 
        advertising and packaging. Thus, the manufacturers,and, by extension, 
        the pet stores, abrogate all responsibility for injuries and deaths that 
        results when the consumers of their products use those products as illustrated 
        or described in advertisements and on packaging, and too often replicated 
        in pet store enclosures.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The customer 
        is just supposed to know that hot rocks are not suitable as a primary, 
        and often secondary, heat source, despite the fact that they are pictured 
        as such in their advertising and packaging.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Consumers 
        are just supposed to know that wrapping a hot rock in a sock or towel 
        or burying it under newspaper or woodchips is supposed to be a fire hazard 
        when the packaging contains no such warnings.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Consumers 
        are just supposed to know that even though an iguana is pictured happily 
        roasting on a hot rock that hot rocks are not appropriate for iguanas.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
        by failing to aggressively pursue both the pet stores and product manufacturers 
        when their animals are injured or killed by the use of such products, 
        pet stores and product manufacturers are able to shrug off undocumented 
        complaints, since as far as they know, no injuries or deaths have occurred...and 
        when they do, it is through the consumer's own ignorance, not any fault 
        of the product or misleading advertising and packaging.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">It is 
        our animals who suffer from such circular logic, not the product manufacturers' 
        bottom line.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Know 
        Your Species<br>
        </b>More precisely, know the natural habits of the species you keep. Reptiles 
        utilize heat in different ways. While there are some similarities, how 
        a species utilizes heat sources in its environment should be mimicked 
        in captivity through the use of appropriate types of heat sources.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Reptiles 
        absorb and lose heat in three different ways: radiation, convection, and 
        conduction. <i>Radiation</i> is the heat that hits the body directly from 
        an overhead heat source. <i>Convection</i> is the heat reflected or bounced 
        from other surfaces. <i>Conduction</i> is soaking up heat from a surface 
        contact. In reptilian terms, this means they get radiation from exposure 
        to the sun or their basking light, convected heat that is bounced off 
        surfaces like the outside wall and patio when the reptile is housed outside, 
        or from some enclosure and furnishings surfaces inside their outdoor or 
        indoor enclosure. Conducted heat is the heat they get from laying on a 
        heated surface. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Heat sources 
        in captivity can be a light bulb used to provide white light and heat 
        or one that produces dim light and heat; an infrared bulb producing both 
        dim light and heat; a ceramic heating element; an infrared panel; a human 
        heating pad; a farrowing pad; central heating heating the entire building 
        the reptile is housed in; a space heater heating only the room the reptile 
        is housed in; and/or agricultural or plumbers flexible heat tape. Depending 
        on the species and where you live (which affects the ambient room air 
        temperature of the rooms the reptiles are kept in), you may need to use 
        one or more of these heat sources to attain and maintain the temperatures 
        your species require in the way the species requires it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Products 
        made for human use inside their homes and on their bodies tend to be safer 
        than products made for reptiles. So, while a human heating pad may essentially 
        do the same thing as a hot rock, when it comes to choosing one to use 
        as a secondary heat source for a thigmothermic or heliothermic species.</font></p>

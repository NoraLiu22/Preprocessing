  <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">This canal is a very interesting facility. I 
  read a book about the canal years ago, and it said that it is one of the few fully 
  sea-level shipping canals in the world. The original C &amp; D Canal was built privately 
  in the 1820s, and it opened for business in 1829, and it had 10 feet of water 
  depth, and it had four locks and it carried barges and sailing vessels that were 
  towed by teams of mules and horses. These stated channel depths are as measured 
  below the average low tide water level. The canal was purchased by the U.S. government 
  in 1919, and there were several expansions of the canal by the U.S. Army Corps 
  of Engineers (US ACE) over the years. In the 1920s, the canal was excavated and 
  deepened to create a sea-level facility with a channel 12 feet deep and 90 feet 
  wide, with no locks, completed in 1927. From 1935 to 1938, the canal channel was 
  deepened to 27 feet of water depth and widened to 250 feet, with another project 
  to provide same-draft access to the C &amp; D Canal from Chesapeake Bay, which expanded 
  a federal navigation channel for 26 miles, to 27 feet deep and 400 feet wide.</p>
  <p>By the mid 1970s, further deepening/widening projects increased the channel 
  depth to 35 feet of water depth, with the channel width increased to 450 feet, 
  which is adequate for two-way traffic for most oceangoing ships. The upper Chesapeake 
  Bay dredged channel was also deepened to 35 feet deep, in conjunction with the 
  last set of projects. Even though Delaware is relatively flat, the canal did cut 
  through a &quot;ridge&quot; about 60 feet above sea level, and the last expansion project 
  required an enormous amount of excavation. The C&amp;D Canal provides a shortcut of 
  about 300 miles for ship traffic between the Port of Baltimore, and the northeastern 
  U.S. cities and Europe. The C &amp; D Canal is listed on the National Register of 
  Historic Places, and it is designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering 
  and Mechanical Engineering landmark. The C &amp; D Canal is the only major commercial 
  canal in the U.S. that is still in use, among those which were built during the 
  heyday of canal building in the early 1800s. The C &amp; D Canal is also the site 
  of 6 large bridges that were built for the specific purpose of crossing the canal 
  with 5 highway crossings and 1 railroad crossing. The C &amp; D Canal also has hiking 
  and bicycle trails along the shoreline of most of the canal&#39;s length.</p>

  The <a href="http://www.dartfirststate.com/reports/railstudy/">Delaware Passenger 
  Rail Engineering Study</a>, published January 15, 2002, has details about the 
  clearance and operation of the railroad bridge. Excerpt (in blue text):<br>
  <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">The moveable bridge is a single-track 
  lift bridge, completed in 1966, with manual signals governing operations over 
  the bridge. A local Bridge Tender controls the movable section of the bridge. 
  The closed (lowered) bridge clearance is 45 feet above mean high water (MHW). 
  When full open (raised), clearance is 133 feet MHW, and it is raised an additional 
  five feet (called &quot;high lift&quot; position) in a second step. It takes approximately 
  six minutes to raise the bridge to high lift.<br>
  <br>
  The bridge must be open for passage of nearly all commercial vessels, including 
  tugboats and ships. It must also be open for passage of private and recreational 
  vessels requiring clearance. Local traffic, whether commercial or private vessels, 
  typically call the bridge before arriving on VHF Channel 13. Sailboats of about 
  32 feet and larger require the bridge to be open, and are common during the spring, 
  summer, and fall.<br>
  <br>
  The present level of waterway traffic versus railroad traffic is such that the 
  bridge is kept in the open position, and closed for train moves. The bridge is 
  typically closed about six times per day for train movements. The Bridge Tender 
  is required to notify the USACE dispatcher 30 minutes prior to closing the bridge.</font></font></font><font size="2" face="Arial">

  <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">C &amp; D Canal Milestones synthesis from the US 
  ACE article follows.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Mid-1600s -- Augustine Herman, a Dutch envoy 
  and mapmaker, observed that two large bodies of water, the Delaware River and 
  Chesapeake Bay, were separated only by a narrow strip of land. Herman proposed 
  that a waterway be built to connect the two, since the canal would reduce, by 
  nearly 300 miles, the water routes between Philadelphia and Baltimore. <br>
  Mid 1760s -- Surveys of possible water routes across the Delaware / Maryland Peninsula 
  were performed. <br>
  1788 -- Regional business leaders, including Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush, 
  raise the issue of constructing the waterway.<br>
  1802 -- The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Company was incorporated. More surveys 
  followed.<br>
  1804 -- Construction of the canal began, including 14 locks to connect the Christina 
  River in Delaware with the Elk River at Welch Point, Md. The project was halted 
  two years later for lack of funds. <br>
  1822 -- The canal company was reorganized.<br>
  1823 and 1824 -- Two senior US ACE commissioned officer engineers assist civilian 
  engineers in determining a canal route, and recommended a new route with four 
  locks, extending from Newbold&#39;s Landing Harbor (now Delaware City, Del.), westward 
  to the Back Creek branch of the Elk River in Maryland. <br>
  April 1824 -- Construction resumes, with about 2,600 men digging with pick and 
  shovel, and hauling dirt from the ditch.<br>
  1829 -- C &amp; D Canal Company announces that the waterway is open for business. 
  The construction cost was almost $2.5 million, one of the most expensive canal 
  projects of its era.<br>
  1829 to 1919 -- C &amp; D Canal operational, with Chesapeake Bay and Delaware River 
  connected by a navigation channel measuring nearly 14 miles long, 10 feet deep, 
  66 feet wide at the waterline and 36 feet wide along the channel bottom. A covered 
  wooden bridge at Summit, Del., spanned the canal across the &quot;Deep Cut,&quot; with a 
  250-foot-long span over the waterway. The bottom of the bridge was 90 feet above 
  the channel bottom. Three other wooden swing bridges also crossed the canal. The 
  4 canal locks were at Delaware City, St. Georges, Del., and two at Chesapeake 
  City, Md. The dimension of each lock was 100 feet long and 22 feet wide, and they 
  were eventually enlarged to 220 feet in length and 24 feet in width. Teams of 
  mules and horses towed the watergoing vessels the canal. <br>
  1919 -- Canal purchased by the Federal government for $2.5 million and designated 
  the &quot;Intra-coastal Waterway - Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay, Delaware and Maryland&quot;. 
  The canal infrastructure included six road bridges plus a railroad bridge owned 
  by the Pennsylvania Railroad. These bridges were replaced during the 1920s by 
  four vertical lift-span bridges and a new railroad bridge. <br>
  1927 -- A set of upgrade projects was completed that year. The eastern canal entrance 
  at Delaware City was relocated several miles south to Reedy Point, Del. The canal 
  trench was excavated so that the waterway was converted to a sea-level operation, 
  with the trench 12 feet deep and 90 feet wide. These upgrades cost $10 million.<br>
  1933 -- US ACE Philadelphia District takes over operation of the canal.<br>
  1935 to 1938 -- Canal channel excavated to be deepened to 27 feet and widened 
  to 250 feet, and the project cost nearly $13 million. Another project to provide 
  same-draft access to the C &amp; D Canal from Chesapeake Bay, expanded a federal navigation 
  channel to 27 feet deep and 400 feet wide for 26 miles. <br>
  1940s -- The two vertical liftspan road bridges at St. Georges and Chesapeake 
  City, were knocked down by ship collisions, and were replaced with high-level 
  bridges.<br>
  1954 -- U.S. Congress authorizes further expansion of the canal channel to 450 
  feet wide and 35 feet deep. The upper Chesapeake Bay dredged channel was also 
  deepened to 35 feet deep. These improvements began in the 1960s and were completed 
  in the mid-1970s.<br>
  1960 -- Summit Bridge completed, a high-level road traffic bridge over the canal.<br>
  1966 -- New railroad lift bridge over the canal completed by US ACE and transferred 
  to the Pennsylvania Railroad to carry freight across the canal. <br>
  1968 -- Reedy Point Bridge completed, a high-level road traffic bridge over the 
  canal.<br>
  1960s to the mid-1970s -- Construction projects expand the canal channel to 450 
  feet wide and 35 feet deep. The upper Chesapeake Bay dredged channel was also 
  deepened to 35 feet deep.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The US ACE completed a study in 1996 for a channel 
  deepening project to 40 feet of water depth, and that would include not only the 
  C &amp; D Canal itself but also 36 miles of channel deepening for the dredged shipping 
  channel in the upper Chesapeake Bay that connects to the C &amp; D Canal. Both the 
  canal and the Bay channel are currently 35 feet deep (channel depths are measured 
  below the average low tide water level). As of 2004, two major factors have stalled 
  the channel deepening projects; the recent downturn in the economy of the Port 
  of Baltimore has reduced the economic need somewhat, and there are major environmental 
  impacts to the Bay that would be caused by the dredging, and there is not sufficient 
  consensus among the various stakeholders as to whether the costs (the financial 
  construction costs plus the costs to the natural environment) of the projects 
  are acceptable when compared to the economic benefits of the projects. Also, oceangoing 
  ships with up to 40 feet of draft (depth below the waterline) can utilize the 
  lower Chesapeake Bay to access the Port of Baltimore, since 40 feet is the ruling 
  depth of the dredged channels that are along that route (much of that route is 
  through water that is naturally deeper than 40 feet). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Quotes from the US ACE article (blue text):<br>
  </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">A Corps feasibility study to 
  investigate improvements for the canal and the Baltimore connecting navigation 
  channels of Tolchester, Brewerton Eastern Extension and Swan Point was completed 
  in December 1996 with the signing of the Chief of Engineers&#39; report. The study, 
  co-sponsored by the Maryland Department of Transportation, investigated deepening 
  of the channel to 40 feet from its current 35 foot depth, plus additional navigation 
  improvements and environmental initiatives. (NOTE: On Jan. 22, 2001, the Philadelphia 
  District announced that this study was being suspended based on recent downturns 
  in Port of Baltimore container ship traffic).</font></p>

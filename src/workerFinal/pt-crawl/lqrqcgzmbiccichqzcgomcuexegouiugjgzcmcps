      <h2>The State of the Art – 1928 - Part 1 </h2>
      <i> 
      <h3>Motion Picture Sound Recording In Its Infancy</h3>
      </i> 
      <blockquote><i>by Edward Bernds </i></blockquote>
      <p>
      <i> 
      <p>It was 1928 and the panic was on. Warner Brothers had just released the 
        ground breaking film "The Jazz Singer" and it soon became apparent to 
        many in Hollywood: sound was<b> not</b> a fad. Only Warners had sound 
        men, however, and they had all signed contracts. Studio executives began 
        scouring the country for anyone familiar with sound. They approached radio 
        engineers to fill the gap. Enter Ed Bernds.</p>
      <p>He was lured to Hollywood and became a pioneer of production sound recording, 
        working with legendary Hollywood figures from Douglas Fairbanks to D.W. 
        Griffith. He recorded the sound on virtually all of Frank Capra's films, 
        then went on to a successful career as a director. Last February, he was 
        honored by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures for his achievements.</p>
      <p>What Bernds witnessed and actively helped shape was the birth of motion 
        picture sound. Few people are fortunate enough to have had the vantage 
        point of Ed Bernds, let alone the presence of mind to have documented 
        what he observed. What follows are excerpts from his upcoming book, "Mr. 
        B. Goes to Hollywood," courtesy of Scarecrow Publishing.</p>
      <p>In the beginning, there were sound and photographic tests of actors and 
        actresses, talking prologues for otherwise silent films, and talking-picture 
        segments for those abominable hybrids, part-talking films. I worked on 
        several of these fragments. When I came to United Artists, I needed only 
        a few days to realize that what we were doing was of importance to the 
        movie industry, to the people who went to movie theaters, and, incidentally, 
        to me. I began to keep a day-by-day journal, not a "dear diary" affair 
        of secret thoughts and weighty opinions, but a bare-bones account of what 
        we did and how we did it, day by day. </p>
      </i><font size=3>
<p>In 1928, a year of sudden change, events moved rapidly. I received a 
        phone call -- a most unlikely phone call -- from Howard Campbell. He informed 
        me that he was the Chief Engineer of the brand-new sound department at 
        the United Artists movie studio and he offered me a job in Hollywood. 
        I agreed quickly. I was entering a challenging and glamorous new field 
        and a future full of uncertainties. </p>
      <p>My first encounters were with bureaucracy, not glamour, however. After 
        a long trip from Chicago to Los Angeles, I crossed Formosa Avenue and 
        entered the UA main gate. I was directed to the office of Sam Hill, studio 
        superintendent, who gave me a studio pass identifying me as a sound technician. 
        Next, to the payroll office, where I was told that I would be on the payroll 
        as of that day. I was grateful for the twelve dollars and fifty cents 
        I earned so easily. </p>
      <p>I phoned Campbell’s office. His secretary informed me that Campbell would 
        not be available that day. I was free to do as I pleased. </p>
      <p>The streets and walkways of the UA lot were crowded with actors and extras 
        dressed in the costumes of the French monarchy. Douglas Fairbanks was 
        making a film, "The Iron Mask," a sequel to his classic "The Three Musketeers." 
        Here, at last, was glamour. When the actors and extras were needed, an 
        assistant director ordered them back to work, and soldiers, priests, swashbucklers 
        and even Cardinal Richelieu obeyed his command. </p>
      <p>I was confronted by a sign: "Positively No Visitors Allowed." I was not 
        a visitor, I told myself, I was a sound technician; my studio pass said 
        so. I entered and no one challenged me. </p>
      <p>What I saw was stunning -- a huge set, a street of old Paris filled with 
        people, lighted by hundreds of arc-lights. The big ones were called sun-arcs, 
        but the light they produced seemed whiter and bluer than sunlight. </p>
      <p>It was a noisy, crowded set; there seemed to be a dozen things happening 
        at the same time. I tried to discern if there was some sort of order in 
        this chaos. My attention was drawn to a man who seemed to be in charge. 
        He shouted orders in a strong, commanding voice, and men obeyed him; but 
        I learned that he was the boss electrician, called appropriately enough, 
        the gaffer. Then I saw that another man exerted a great deal of authority; 
        but he was Lucky Humberstone, the assistant director. Finally I discovered 
        that the gentleman sitting quietly in a canvas chair was the director, 
        Allan Dwan.</p>
      <p>I found myself wondering how we, the sound people, could fit into that 
        turbulent new world, and what changes we would bring. For one thing, the 
        sun-arcs would have to go. The heart of each arc-light was an intense, 
        white-hot electrical fire. The flames were fed by carbon rods; these had 
        to be rotated - driven by electric motors to ensure even-burning. The 
        stage was filled with the grinding noise of the motors and the high-pitched 
        whine of the flames. </p>
      <p>I found our new sound building. It was not quite complete -- workmen 
        were putting finishing touches on the structure, and inside the building 
        workers were opening crates of sound equipment. In what would become the 
        recording rooms there were large cement pedestals; I was told that the 
        recording machines were to be mounted on them. It seemed to me that we 
        were many weeks from being able to go to work as sound men. </p>
      <p>Days later I was summoned to meet Campbell. There were no friendly preliminaries, 
        no "Did you have a good trip?" or "Welcome to Hollywood!" Instead, he 
        complained about the pampered, entrenched movie people, the producers, 
        directors and cameramen. "They don’t like us," Campbell said. "They don’t 
        like sound; they wish we’d go away, but we’re not going away." His theme 
        was that if you gave those motion picture autocrats an inch they’d take 
        a mile. His response was that we would not give them that inch. I was 
        troubled by Campbell’s intransigence. I felt that it would make the transition 
        from silent to sound films more difficult and certainly more abrasive. 
      </p>
      <p>I saw redoubled activity in the sound building -- more men opening more 
        crates and more electricians pulling more wires through conduits. A man 
        in a business suit was also watching. He shook his head and turned away 
        as though what he saw pained him. "Lots going on in there." I said. "There 
        certainly is," the man replied. "On overtime." </p>
      <p>His name was Dent, and he was a member of the UA accounting department. 
        His responsibility was cost control, and he was not happy about skyrocketing 
        costs. It was the fault, he said, of the UA partners, who wrangled and 
        complained and failed to agree on a plan of action. Joseph Schenck, the 
        executive the stars had taken in as a partner, had given an interview 
        in which he said that sound pictures were a mediocre novelty and predicted 
        that they would not last more than three or four months. Dent credited 
        Mary Pickford, whom he regarded highly, with forcing her partners to stop 
        bickering and come to a decision. She was convinced, Mary told them, that 
        sound was not going to fade away; and, much as she disliked doing so, 
        she would vote to convert to sound. Her partners agreed, reluctantly, 
        but their indecisiveness had caused the loss of three or four valuable 
        weeks. "Now we’re trying to catch up," Dent said. </p>
      <p>At last the sound building was finished. The swarm of workmen departed, 
        and Western Electric engineers began to test the recording equipment. 
        That equipment and the way it was used had a significant effect on the 
        quality of the early sound films. In 1928, there were four such sound 
        systems in use:</p>
      <p>Vitaphone was the Warner Brothers' system. They lit the firecrackers 
        that caused the film industry to stampede to sound; and they did it with 
        a system -- disc recording -- that was impractical for motion picture 
        production. Disc recordings could not be edited. It was one thing to put 
        a recorded song on a disc, with an adlib by Al Jolson at the end of it; 
        it was quite another to edit a fast-moving melodrama, in which there might 
        be a dozen short scenes - "cuts" - in one minute of film. And using disc 
        sound in the theater was trouble-prone. A projectionist had to possess 
        keen eyesight and a steady hand to place the stylus on the correct start-point. 
        If he missed by only one groove the movie was grotesquely out of sync, 
        which generally caused the audience to laugh or to yell angrily and throw 
        things. The Warner Brothers saw the light and changed quickly to sound-on-film. 
      </p>
      <p>The Fox sound system was Movietone. First used in newsreel cameras as 
        a "single system," sound and picture were recorded on one negative in 
        the camera. The heart of this system was a gas-filled tube, called an 
        AEO light which, when activated by an audio input, responded by producing 
        sound-modulated light that could be photographed. When the AEO light was 
        used in a separate recorder, the film could be edited, but the quality 
        was poor, and the Fox-Case system soon went the way of Vitaphone and the 
        carrier pigeon. </p>
      <p>The RCA system, Photophone, was also an optical sound system. It employed 
        a galvanometer-type device in which a tiny mirror twisted and turned in 
        response to sound waves and photographed those sound waves on film. This 
        produced a negative, white-on-black, in which the profile of the sound 
        resembled a mountain range with many peaks and valleys. Printed, the mountain 
        range became black; the background white. Photophone could be edited and 
        development and printing of the film was not critical. </p>
      <p>We at the United Artists studio used the Western Electric variable density 
        sound system. The sound image was recorded not as a black and white mountain 
        range, but as a series of black, white and gray bars of infinite complexity 
        and accuracy. The heart of the system was a brilliant invention called 
        a light valve. A pair of ultralight metallic ribbons provided a slit through 
        which a strong source of light was focused on the film as it passed through 
        the recording machine and photographed the sound. The Western Electric 
        light valve had one significant advantage over the RCA mirror galvanometer: 
        the light-valve were so light that they had no measurable inertia. The 
        RCA mirror, although it was made as light as possible, had an appreciable 
        degree of inertia, so that it resisted modulation by faint sounds, and 
        tended to overmodulate loud sounds, a flaw generally called "volume expansion." 
        It was not a serious problem; RCA variable area sound and Western Electric 
        variable density sound served well until magnetic sound -- tape recording 
        -- replaced them in film production. </p>
      <p>The man who invented the light-valve may have been a genius, but the 
        engineers who designed the other Western Electric equipment were decidedly 
        not. Everything they provided for us was oversized and overweight. They 
        must have come straight from designing battleship hardware because they 
        made liberal use of bronze, which resists salt-water corrosion but is, 
        of course, heavy. Salt-water corrosion is not a serious problem in Hollywood. 
      </p>
      <p>Their masterpiece was a portable mixing panel. It was not made of bronze, 
        but of steel, and it was portable, after a fashion; it had a pair of handles, 
        and two strong men, chancing the peril of hernia, could carry it. </p>
      <p>The cables and cable connectors were also grossly overweight. We called 
        the bronze connectors "pineapple connectors," because they were roughly 
        the size and shape of large pineapples. I have a personal grudge against 
        them -- a pineapple connector broke my nose. We carried coils of cables 
        on the roof of our sound truck. I stood on a ladder to take down one of 
        the cables. When I lifted it, a connector, not properly secured, swung 
        free and smashed my nose. I dropped the cable and nearly fell off of the 
        ladder. Had I fallen, I might well have broken my neck, my head, or both. 
        A studio driver took me to a doctor, who stuffed my nose with cotton, 
        told me to use an ice pack, and assured me that my nose would heal straight. 
        A prize-fighter’s bend might have made my unremarkable nose more interesting. 
      </p>
      <p>It was inevitable that the microphone Western Electric provided for us 
        would also be heavy. Officially, it was called a condenser-transmitter-amplifier, 
        CTA for short. The nature of a CTA required that an amplifier be a part 
        of the device; this added to bulk and weight, so that the CTA weighed 
        about eight pounds; and naturally, it was encased in bronze. The result 
        was that this electronic heavyweight, which should have been light, agile 
        and capable of quick movement, proved difficult to move. It was even, 
        because of its size, difficult to conceal in the benighted days when we 
        concealed microphones in flower arrangements and behind curtains. </p>
      <p>The size and weight of the equipment may have added to the difficulty 
        of making the first sound films, but it was the manner in which we used 
        that equipment that affected, for better or for worse, our first productions. 
        Too frequently, our methods were not helpful. Western Electric people 
        finished their tests and turned the equipment over to us. </p>
      <p>We began testing, but our tests were essentially useless; there was no 
        consideration of the way the system would ultimately be used. Several 
        of the infamous camera booths had been built; we could have requested 
        a camera crew and actors for a full-fledged camera and sound test, but 
        we did not. In short, we were given no training in actual picture-making. 
        The time came -- inevitably -- when we had to begin the work we were being 
        paid for.</p>

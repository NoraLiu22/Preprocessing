<HR>
<P>I can't go to the store because I waited too long
<BR>Can't get another nothing because I waited too long
<BR>Because no one would go with me
<BR>Because I got one already
<P>Because it's too late
<P>I can't get another job because I got one already
<BR>Can't get another house because I moved in already
<BR>Because I waited too long
<BR>Because it was too late
<BR>I waited too long
<P>Because it's too late

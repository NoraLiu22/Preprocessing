An office block of glass and steel becomes a boxed-in prison; a chaotic restaurant provides a memorably liberating opportunity for humanity to express itself.</p>

<p>“Tati’s ruinously ambitious masterpiece starts as a satire of modern architecture and becomes a strangely beatific celebration of the way people move through public spaces. A film about minor embarrassments and fleeting connections between strangers, it begins in alienation and builds to a transcendent vision of communal harmony. Gruelling labour went into each seemingly effortless grace note, as Tati the performer drifts in aimless bewilderment through the world that Tati the director obsessively controls. In Playtime, the movie screen is an idealised public space in which Tati’s people demonstrate the joys of being one-dimensional.” <strong>Imogen Sara Smith</strong></p>

<p>“There are plenty of films that offer a critique of technology and modernity. Yet, with his distinctive, meticulous mise en scène, which exploits depth of field in an unparalleled way, and his peculiar ‘downgrading’ of dialogue to a sound like any other, boosting the communicative role of the image, Tati does so in a unique and radical fashion.” <strong>Cristina Formenti</strong></p>

<p>“One of the most ambitious films ever made.” <strong>Jai Arjun Singh</strong></p>

An office block of glass and steel becomes a boxed-in prison; a chaotic restaurant provides a memorably liberating opportunity for humanity to express itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Tati’s ruinously ambitious masterpiece starts as a satire of modern architecture and becomes a strangely beatific celebration of the way people move through public spaces. A film about minor embarrassments and fleeting connections between strangers, it begins in alienation and builds to a transcendent vision of communal harmony. Gruelling labour went into each seemingly effortless grace note, as Tati the performer drifts in aimless bewilderment through the world that Tati the director obsessively controls. In Playtime, the movie screen is an idealised public space in which Tati’s people demonstrate the joys of being one-dimensional.” <strong>Imogen Sara Smith</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There are plenty of films that offer a critique of technology and modernity. Yet, with his distinctive, meticulous mise en scène, which exploits depth of field in an unparalleled way, and his peculiar ‘downgrading’ of dialogue to a sound like any other, boosting the communicative role of the image, Tati does so in a unique and radical fashion.” <strong>Cristina Formenti</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the most ambitious films ever made.” <strong>Jai Arjun Singh</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Jacques Tati","producer":"Bernard Maurice","writer":"Jacques Tati, Jacques Lagrange","featuring":"Jacques Tati, Barbara Dennek, Rita Maïden"},"year":"1967","nameAndYear":"Playtime (1967)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":["Shop"],"productionCountries":"France","runningTime":152,"sightAndSound":{"results":[{"position":23,"tied":false,"category":"critics"},{"position":41,"tied":true,"category":"directors"}],"voters":{"critics":[{"firstname":"Mallory","surname":"Andrews","slug":"mallory-andrews","name":"Mallory Andrews","sortName":"Andrews, Mallory","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Writer","country":"Canada","remarks":null,"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/mallory-andrews"},{"firstname":"Magdalena","surname":"Arau","slug":"magdalena-arau","name":"Magdalena Arau","sortName":"Arau, Magdalena","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Programmer","country":"Argentina","remarks":null,"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/magdalena-arau"},{"firstname":"Colin","surname":"Beckett","slug":"colin-beckett","name":"Colin Beckett","sortName":"Beckett, Colin","type":"critic","jobTitle":"critic","country":"USA","remarks":null,"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/colin-beckett"},{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"de Blois","slug":"marco-de-blois","name":"Marco de Blois","sortName":"Blois, Marco de","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Programmer and curator","country":"Canada","remarks":null,"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/marco-de-blois"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Brody","slug":"richard-brody","name":"Richard Brody","sortName":"Brody, Richard","type":"critic","jobTitle":"film critic","country":"USA","remarks":[{"type":"p","key":"This time around, I found myself thinking of greatness in terms of difficulty—not necessarily practical difficulty, which many filmmakers of varying achievement face, but conceptual difficulty, the combination of production and direction that enables a filmmaker to push the art of cinema drastically and definitively ahead, to blow a hole in the history of the aesthetic and to confront that history, and history itself, at the same time.","ref":null,"props":{"children":"This time around, I found myself thinking of greatness in terms of difficulty—not necessarily practical difficulty, which many filmmakers of varying achievement face, but conceptual difficulty, the combination of production and direction that enables a filmmaker to push the art of cinema drastically and definitively ahead, to blow a hole in the history of the aesthetic and to confront that history, and history itself, at the same time."},"_owner":null}],"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/richard-brody"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Cairns","slug":"david-cairns","name":"David Cairns","sortName":"Cairns, David","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Film director and critic","country":"UK","remarks":[{"type":"p","key":"This was difficult!

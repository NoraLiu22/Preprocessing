/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p align="center"><br />INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 1]]</font> In the 
        very brief discussion of a great subject here attempted, I limit myself 
        to a strict application of the modern doctrine of Organic Evolution to 
        certain definite inquiries as to the probable development of human faculty 
        or character. In doing so I first endeavour to define what is meant by 
        evolution in general and by organic evolution in particular, and then 
        proceed to show what are the essential agencies or processes by means 
        of which the latter carries on its work. Dealing next with our more special 
        subject, I inquire into the supposed differences between the minds of 
        savages and those of civilised man, and also into those between our human 
        nature to-day and that which existed in the earliest historic or pre-historic 
        ages of which we have any records. Having thus arrived at certain probable 
        conclusions, I proceed to suggest the conditions and agencies which are 
        alone adequate to bring about a continuous advance in the average character 
        of man during future ages.</p>
      <p align="center">WHAT IS EVOLUTION?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term Evolution, though now so generally 
        used, is yet often misunderstood. It is supposed by many, perhaps by the 
        majority of non-scientific persons, to indicate a great scientific theory 
        which is applicable to and explains all the phenomena of the universe. 
        But this is, very largely, an erroneous view. It is true that by many 
        of its advocates it is held to be universally applicable, yet it has, 
        so far, only given us a fairly complete explanation in certain departments 
        of nature, and even in these it never carries us back to the beginnings 
        of things; while over some of the broadest fields of scientific research 
        it has been almost entirely inoperative.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its essential idea is that of the continuity 
        of all the phenomena of nature--that everything we see on the earth or 
        in the spaces <font color="#990000">[[p. 2]]</font> around us is not permanent, 
        but has arisen out of something that preceded it. It is thus opposed to 
        the old, and to some extent still prevalent, idea of creation--that things 
        as we now see them have existed from some remote but definite epoch when 
        they came into existence by the act or fiat of a supreme power--the great 
        First Cause. Evolution is thus a general statement that everything is, 
        and always has been, slowly changing under the influences of natural laws 
        and processes; but, except in a few cases, it cannot give a precise account 
        of the methods and causes of the changes, still less can it carry us back 
        to any beginning of the universe. It thus formulates a general process, 
        but is unable to give us any full explanation of that process.</p>
      <p align="center">SLOW GROWTH OF THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the philosophers of Greece had vague 
        ideas of evolution, which were elaborately worked out by the Roman poet 
        Lucretius in his great poem &quot;On the Nature of Things,&quot; yet their views 
        obtained no general acceptance until our own era, owing mainly to the 
        positive statements as to the creation of the universe in the &quot;Old Testament,&quot; 
        and the very general acceptance of that record as the Word of God. Even 
        the very surface of the earth was held to be unchangeable, as implied 
        in the term &quot;the everlasting hills&quot;; while less than fifty years ago so 
        great a writer as George Borrow could speak of a waterfall as being in 
        all details as it was &quot;since the day of creation, and will probably remain 
        to the day of judgment.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern view of continuous change by natural 
        forces was first applied to the surface and structure of the earth, by 
        more or less careful observation of the facts and phenomena included in 
        the modern science of geology. It began with a few acute observers in 
        the seventeenth century, among whom were Leibnitz and Hooke, followed 
        by numerous Italian writers in the eighteenth century, together with the 
        Germans Pallas and Werner; while our own countryman, Hutton, for the first 
        time laid down the great principle of modern earth-study, that we can 
        only understand the past by a careful study of the various changes we 
        now perceive to be in progress. This great principle was afterwards most 
        skilfully applied by Sir Charles Lyell, who devoted a long life to the 
        production and continuous amplification of his monumental work, <em>The 
        Principles of Geology</em>. The idea of evolution was thus applied in 
        detail to one of the greatest and most complex departments of human knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two other great sciences dealing with 
        the constitution of the inorganic world--chemistry and astronomy--progress 
        was for a long time necessarily limited to the study of facts and phenomena, 
        with the laws to which those phenomena are <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        3]]</font> immediately due; and the conclusions arrived at pointed rather 
        to stability and permanence than to that progressive and unceasing change 
        that is the keynote of evolution. The great mathematicians, who at the 
        beginning of the nineteenth century worked at the motions and disturbances 
        in our solar system in accordance with the law of gravitation, came to 
        the conclusion that the system was a stable one, that all irregularities 
        were slight and temporary, and that the planets and their satellites were 
        so arranged that their present positions and motions might continue for 
        ever without any destructive changes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In like manner it was for long a fundamental 
        doctrine of chemistry that the elements were fixed and unchangeable, and 
        the belief of the alchemists that other substances might be converted 
        into gold was held to be as baseless and as unscientific a dream as the 
        idea that matter itself was destructible.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in our own day, and largely by the work 
        of men still living, all these assumptions of indestructibility and permanence 
        have been rudely shaken or altogether given up as in their turn unscientific. 
        Through the development of what may be well termed the two modern sciences--electricity 
        and spectrum analysis--together with the systematic study of the long-neglected 
        phenomena of meteors and meteor systems, quite new conceptions have been 
        reached as to the constitution of the universe, ascending, on the one 
        hand, to the nature and origin of the myriad stars and suns and nebul&aelig; 
        which constitute our universe, and descending on the other to the nature, 
        the constitution, and even the instability of matter itself, as indicated 
        by the strange and almost incredible phenomena presented by radio-active 
        substances.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By these various advances in many directions 
        we have attained the certainty that the great principle of evolution pervades 
        the entire realm of nature, from the faint specks of star-dust on the 
        farthest limits of our stellar universe, down to what were once supposed 
        to be the indestructible atoms of matter itself, now proved to be complex 
        systems of electric force-points, subject to disturbances and even to 
        absolute disintegration. We thus seem able dimly to comprehend on the 
        one hand the evolution of matter itself, with its marvellous properties, 
        which enable it to become manifest in the myriad forms made known to us 
        by the chemist or existing in the vast laboratory of nature; on the other 
        hand, the evolution of this matter into the inconceivably vast and complex 
        stellar universe. Everywhere we behold a state of flux, of development, 
        and also, apparently, of decay. Every increase of knowledge seems to imply 
        that the material universe is a vast organism which must have had a beginning 
        and will have an end--which was born and will die. The dissipation of 
        energy <font color="#990000">[[p. 4]]</font> and the disintegration of 
        matter alike render this conclusion logically certain.</p>
      <p align="center">ORGANIC EVOLUTION.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preceding remarks apply only to what may 
        be termed inorganic or physical evolution, which necessarily preceded 
        and prepared the way for the evolution of the organic world--an evolution 
        which is utterly unlike anything which preceded it and which has culminated 
        in the production of man--the one being who is able, to some extent, to 
        comprehend the universe of which he forms a part, to penetrate to its 
        remotest confines, to study its laws and to speculate on its nature, its 
        origin, and its destiny. Hence we may naturally conclude that the final 
        law and purpose of the whole universe was the development of so marvellous

      <p align="center">ORGANIC AND INORGANIC EVOLUTION COMPARED.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be well to note here the fundamental 
        difference between organic and inorganic evolution, a difference so great 
        and so radical that it is somewhat misleading to use the same term to 
        describe them both. The changes that occur in the inorganic matter of 
        the universe are of three kinds. (1) The changes of eternal form, and 
        to some extent of internal structure, caused by the disintegration and 
        aggregation of masses of matter, as in the formation of most rocks and 
        in the successive modifications of the earth's surface. (2) The changes 
        in the state of matter--solid, liquid, and gaseous--dependent on the amount 
        of heat received from without or generated within cosmical bodies. (3) 
        Chemical changes, by which the very constitution of matter becomes so 
        modified as to give each new compound a special character and properties 
        which it usually retains unchanged for indefinite periods. The various 
        kinds of matter produced by these changes seem to be permanent so long 
        as the conditions remain the same, but, except in the case of crystals, 
        they are of no definite shape or size. By changes of conditions they become 
        to some extent interchangeable, but, except when subjected to these changes, 
        they remain inert, or subject to excessively slow processes of degradation 
        or decomposition, whence the common term dead matter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic evolution, on the other hand, leads 
        to the production of highly complex individual entities of definite forms, 
        each in a state of constant internal movement, each permeated by liquids 
        and gases by means of which they assimilate new matter from <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        5]]</font> the outer world, change that matter into new forms that occur 
        nowhere else in nature, and are enabled to carry on the mysterious processes 
        of growth and reproduction. Each of these individuals, beginning with 
        minute cells in the body of a parent, passes through a regular cycle of 
        growth, maturity, and decay, culminating in what we term death, when all 
        its regular internal motions cease, it becomes disintegrated by the agency 
        of lower organisms, and finally helps to build up other forms of life. 
        Each reproduces its kind almost identical in all respects with the parent, 
        thus forming a cycle which was long believed to be perpetual and unchanging, 
        the species of animals and plants being held to be fixed entities produced 
        by some act of creative power. The great and unique phenomenon of the 
        organic world is reproductive growth by the absorption and transformation 
        of inorganic and organic matter, and the building up again and again of 
        a highly complex organism from a single cell. It is this wonderful process 
        that we term Life, whether manifested in animals which possess sensation 
        and in their higher forms consciousness, or in plants which there is no 
        reason to believe possess these faculties.</p>
      <p align="center">THE LAW OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about the middle of the last century so great 
        a man of science as Sir John Herschell spoke of the mode of origin of 
        the various species of animals and plants as being the &quot;mystery of mysteries&quot;; 
        for although many writers had discarded &quot;special creation&quot; and had expressed 
        a belief in evolution through the normal process of generation, yet no 
        one had shown <em>how</em> the various species and genera had been produced, 
        or by what means the wonderful adaptation of each to its special conditions 
        of existence had been brought about. The problem was, however, solved 
        by Charles Darwin almost coincidently with the other great advances in 
        the domain of inorganic nature already alluded to.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental law which he discovered, and 
        was the first to develop in all its far-reaching results, is that of &quot;Natural 
        Selection,&quot; or the &quot;Survival of the Fittest.&quot; This great law of nature 
        is the result of a group of well-known and universal facts--(1) the enormous 
        powers of increase of all organisms, an increase so great that any one 
        of them, if left alone in an unoccupied continent, would fill it to overflowing 
        in a few years or centuries. As, however, the whole earth is already occupied, 
        this simultaneous increase of all the thousands of species in every country 
        produces a &quot;struggle for existence,&quot; there being no room for the new-comers 
        under average conditions till the parents have ceased to exist; and as 
        all the higher animals (and plants) live several years, breeding every 
        year, it is evident that on the <font color="#990000">[[p. 6]]</font> 
        average all their progeny must die from various causes before, or shortly 
        after, they arrive at maturity except <em>one pair</em> to replace the 
        two parents.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now comes the question, is the destruction of 
        the superfluous thousands a matter of pure chance, or is there any cause 
        why certain individuals should survive the rest? If the offspring were 
        always identical copies of the parents, not only in external form, but 
        in every internal character and quality, in health, in acuteness of the 
        senses, in activity, and in all the mental powers and faculties, then 
        we should be obliged to impute to chance alone the destruction of ninety-nine 
        while one survived. But we know there is no such similarity. In every 
        large family of children considerable diversities occur as the rule rather 
        than as the exception. In every litter of kittens or of puppies there 
        are similar differences; while it has been through the selection of some 
        of these varieties and the rejection of others that all our fine breeds 
        of horses, cattle, and sheep have been produced, as well as all our fancy 
        pigeons and poultry. And we now know that exactly the same thing occurs 
        among animals and plants. By collecting and examining hundreds or thousands 
        of individuals in one district and during one season, an amount of variation 
        is found to exist much greater than anything that even Darwin expected. 
        He sometimes spoke of nature having to wait for &quot;favourable variations&quot;; 
        of natural selection being powerless unless &quot;favourable variations&quot; occurred 
        when required. But these doubts and hesitations are utterly needless. 
        There are <em>always</em> favourable variations in every direction, and 
        in ample quantity. Take any measurable character you please, and in 50 
        or 100 or 1,000 individuals about one-third or one-fourth will be considerably 
        above or below the mean, so much so as to be distinctly visible to us, 
        while about one-third or one-half are so near the average of the whole 
        that on a cursory inspection we should say they were all alike. But as, 
        every year, only from one-tenth to one-hundredth of the young of a given 
        species can survive, there is always an ample supply of &quot;favourable variations.&quot; 
        We must remember also that nature does not select, as we are often obliged 
        to do, by the size or form of any limb, part, or organ, but by the resultant 
        <em>qualities</em>, and we know that these qualities vary as much as the 
        parts of the body we can measure or estimate. Horses, from the same or 
        equally good parents, vary in speed and in endurance; dogs in acuteness 
        of smell or of sight; sheep in the thickness of their wool; cows in their 
        milk-giving capacity. In all these cases there is a considerable amount 
        of better or of worse, offering ample &quot;favourable variations.&quot; During 
        an exceptionally severe winter only the swiftest and most enduring wolves 
        survive, the rest perishing of cold and <font color="#990000">[[p. 7]]</font> 
        hunger. In a prolonged drought it is only the tallest giraffes that find 
        food enough to support life; and thus, by a periodical weeding-out of 
        all but the very best--the fittest to survive under these unfavourable 
        conditions--the standard of efficiency in each species is preserved by 
        the rigid destruction of the less fit. It must always be remembered that, 
        although the <em>average</em> population of each species varies very little 
        during long periods, yet there may be considerable fluctuations annually. 
        Some seasons will favour one species, some another; we then notice the 
        abundance of certain birds or insects, generally followed a year or two 
        later by a corresponding scarcity, keeping up the balance of the various 
        forms of life in generally uniform proportions so long as the natural 
        conditions, or &quot;environment,&quot; continue to be the same or nearly the same.</p>
      <p align="center">THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To anyone who has thoroughly grasped the extent 
        and universality of variation within the limits of every common or widely-spread 
        species, it will be at once evident that the very same causes which preserve 
        each species in exact adjustment to its environment, will also, when that 
        environment changes in any direction, enable it to become automatically 
        adjusted to the new conditions. This must be the case, because all alterations 
        in environment are necessarily very gradual. Changes of climate require 
        thousands of years before they attain an amount greater than occurs during 
        the ordinary seasonal or periodical changes to which all animals and plants 
        are already adjusted. If a new enemy enters a country, it requires a number 
        of years, perhaps centuries, before it can become itself adapted to the 
        new conditions and increase to an extent sufficient to endanger any considerable 
        number of other species. Some of the weaker kinds, and a proportion of 
        the young of the stronger and more numerous, will no doubt fall a prey; 
        but this will itself lead to the adaptation and improvement of the remainder, 
        since those that escape will inevitably be those who are best fitted, 
        either by swiftness, or strength, or cunning, or by possessing some special 
        coloration or peculiar habit that conceals them from the enemy. The very 
        danger itself leads to such a gradual modification of the sufferers as 
        to enable those that escape to become the progenitors of a race better 
        fitted to cope with the new danger.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more certainly automatic are the effects 
        of climatic or food changes. To some these changes will be injurious, 
        to some indifferent, to a few perhaps beneficial. The former will be weakened 
        and thus fall a prey to the other causes of destruction, while the latter, 
        being actually improved in health, will always furnish a large proportion 
        of those that survive and become the parents of new races.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 8]]</font> It is 
        thus evident that those species which are already best adapted to the 
        environment in a large country, that have a wide geographical range and 
        exist in very great numbers, will be those that, by furnishing a large 
        amount of variation every year, will be best able to become rapidly modified 
        into an exact adaptation to any new conditions that may arise. These were 
        termed by Darwin dominant species; and, owing to their general variability 
        and enormous numbers, it is these that usually become the parents of a 
        whole series of diverging species when exposed to a variety of new conditions 
        in different parts of their area.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But besides these dominant forms other species 
        exist which are rare or local, sometimes inhabiting only a very limited 
        area, or being specially adapted to a very restricted mode of life--as 
        when a caterpillar feeds on one species of plant only, and that not a 
        common one. These are the species which are either dying out from want 
        of power to compete with other species, or are so specially adapted to 
        a limited environment that a comparatively slight change leads to their 
        extinction. It is these which become extinct without leaving modified 
        descendants, as seen in the countless genera and families which have successively 
        died out in each geological epoch. The dominant groups, on the other hand, 
        can often be traced far back in geological time, as in the well-known 
        case of the horse tribe, the cats, and some others; or they are those 
        which, though of comparatively recent origin--as the deer and the antelopes--are 
        so well adapted to existing conditions that they have spread over wide 
        areas of the earth's surface with numerous specific forms adapted to local 
        peculiarities of environment.</p>
      <p align="center">UTILITY THE KEY-NOTE OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the facts of nature now briefly sketched 
        are clearly apprehended, there result two propositions of the highest 
        importance. These are: (1) That whatever the amount of variability of 
        a species, no general modification of it will occur so long as the environment 
        remains unchanged; and (2) that when a permanent change (not a mere temporary 
        fluctuation) of the environment occurs--whether of climate, of extension 
        or elevation of land, of diminished food-supply, or of new competitors, 
        or of new enemies--then, and then only, will various specific forms become 
        modified, <em>so as to adapt them more completely to the new conditions 
        of existence</em>. It is easy to see that all the kinds of changes above 
        indicated are so connected that they will inevitably occur together, though 
        in various degrees. Changes of climate or in the area or elevation of 
        the land will cause changes in the vegetation; this will afford more or 
        less food to various kinds of animals, and these animals will again <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        9]]</font> be preyed upon by other animals. At the same time, most of 
        these animals will need adaptation to the climate itself, whether hotter 
        or colder, wetter or dryer; and each will also have new competitors and 
        more or fewer enemies. There will thus be action and reaction of the most 
        complex kind, and if the change of environment is great in amount and 
        extends over a wide area, then, when it is completed, almost all the species 
        that formerly existed will be found to have become more or less changed 
        in form, structure, and habits so as to constitute new species, and in 
        some cases new genera. This amount of change has again and again actually 
        occurred as shown by the extinct animals and plants preserved in the rocks 
        of the various sub-divisions of the Tertiary Period. On the other hand, 
        we find proofs of periods of stability in the fact that certain deposits 
        which, from their extent and thickness must have required a long period 
        of time for their formation, yet contain from top to bottom an almost 
        identical series of species.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various modifications of form, structure, 
        or colour thus produced constitute the &quot;specific character&quot; of each new 
        species, distinguishing it both from its parent species (which will usually 
        have become extinct) and from all its near allies, and each of these characters 
        must have been at the time they were fixed by continued selection, <em>useful</em> 
        to the species. This has been, and still is, denied by many naturalists, 
        mainly because they cannot see or imagine any use in many characters; 
        but they have never succeeded in discovering any cause other than utility 
        adequate to produce new characters which shall be present in all the individuals 
        of a species and strictly confined to them. In order to be developed through 
        natural selection a particular variation must not only be <em>useful</em>, 
        but must, at least occasionally, be of such importance as to lead to the 
        saving of life, or, to use Professor Lloyd-Morgan's suggestive term, be 
        of &quot;survival-value.&quot; This subject has been somewhat fully discussed in 
        Chapters V. to X. of my <em>Darwinism</em>, supplemented and enforced 
        by the five chapters on the &quot;Theory of Evolution&quot; (in my <em>Studies</em>, 
        Vol. I.), and to these works I must refer my readers for fuller information. 
        There is, however, one other preliminary question of special importance 
        as regards the subject of the present essay, that must be briefly discussed.</p>
      <p align="center">THE INHERITANCE OF ACQUIRED CHARACTERS.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A problem of the highest importance as regards 
        the whole theory of organic evolution, and especially in its varied applications 
        to man's nature and advancement both individually and socially, is to 
        determine the limits of heredity. The first great writer who put forth 
        a detailed theory of the method of organic <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        10]]</font> evolution was Lamarck, who believed that the chief cause of 
        the modification of species was desire and effort, leading to the use 
        of certain organs and parts to their fullest capacity; that such use strengthened 
        and enlarged such organs (as it undoubtedly does); and that this increased 
        development was transmitted to the offspring. In this way he thought that 
        all the adaptations of animals to their mode of life--the strength of 
        the lion, the speed of the antelope, the long neck of the giraffe, and 
        all other such characters, had been acquired.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his facts and arguments, though highly ingenious, 
        made little impression, mainly because naturalists perceived that his 
        theory was only applicable to a very small portion of the adaptations 
        which needed explanation. As examples, no exercise of the will or of the 
        muscles could produce those wonderful harmonies of colour which serve 
        to conceal so many herbivorous creatures from their enemies and enable 
        so many of the rapacious kinds to approach their prey. Neither could any 
        similar action of body or mind lead to the growth of the wonderful shells 
        of the mollusca, the bony armour of the tortoises, or the poison-glands 
        of snakes or of stinging-insects. Still less can such causes have been 
        effective in the production of countless adaptations in the whole structure 
        of plants, and especially of their flowers and fruits.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But although Lamarck's theory was seen to be 
        utterly inadequate, its fundamental assumption--that the effects of the 
        use and disuse of organs were transmitted to the offspring--seemed so 
        probable that it was generally accepted without any critical examination, 
        and was even thought by Darwin to be a useful adjunct to his own theory. 
        This was partly due to the fact that none of the early naturalists paid 
        much attention to <em>variation</em>, which was only a source of trouble 
        to them in their efforts to define &quot;true species.&quot; But with the interest 
        excited by Darwin's works the study of varieties was seen to be of the 
        first importance, since they are the materials out of which new species 
        are formed. It was then very soon found that variations are much more 
        abundant, much larger in amount, and much more varied in character than 
        was supposed, and that, together with the ever-growing proofs of the extreme 
        rigour of natural selection, a sufficient explanation of the origin of 
        all species was attained.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then followed the investigations of Galton and 
        Weismann, showing that there was no valid evidence of the transmission 
        of the modifications of individuals due to use or disuse, or to climate, 
        food, or other external agencies, while the elaborate researches of the 
        latter into the earliest processes of reproduction resulting in his illuminating 
        theory of the &quot;continuity of <font color="#990000">[[p. 11]]</font> the 
        germ-plasm,&quot; gave what was probably the death-blow to Lamarck's fundamental 
        assumption.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last decade evidence has been accumulating 
        to prove that, among the higher animals at all events, it is only the 
        inborn characters and tendencies--whether physical or mental--that have 
        any part in producing the varying characters of the offspring, and at 
        the present time it may be said that almost all the chief biological thinkers 
        and investigators hold this view, including Professors Ray-Lankester, 
        Lloyd-Morgan, E. B. Poulton, and Sir W. T. Thiselton-Dyer. The latest 
        and one of the acutest students of this and allied problems--Mr. G. Archdall 
        Reid--in his remarkable work, <em>The Principles of Heredity</em>, sums 
        up the whole case against the heredity of acquired characters with great 
        lucidity, and shows that instead of being, as Darwin and others thought 
        it might be, an aid to natural selection in bringing about adaptation 
        to new conditions, it is really in the great majority of cases antagonistic 
        to it, while in some it would actually neutralise it altogether. Those 
        who are interested in this problem should study Mr. Reid's work, or the 
        smaller but equally conclusive treatise by Mr. W. Platt Ball, <em>Are 
        the Effects of Use and Disuse Inherited?</em> in which the evidence on 
        both sides is fairly given and the answer shown to be unmistakably in 
        the negative.</p>
      <p align="center">HEREDITY IS THE SAME FOR MIND AS FOR BODY.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving this part of our subject it may 
        be as well to state that, broadly speaking, every fact and argument here 
        given applies to the mental as well as to the bodily organs, to the intellectual 
        as well as to the physical powers of animals including man. Galton has 
        proved that genius, like physical qualities, is hereditary, and all other 
        mental faculties are equally so. Great genius, like gigantic stature or 
        enormous strength, is rare, and men in general approximate to the average 
        in mind as well as in body. The only important difference seems to be 
        that the mental faculties vary to a greater extent than the bodily organs. 
        Newton and Cayley in mathematics, Shakespeare and Shelley in poetry, rise 
        higher above the average man in intellect than do the equally rare giants 
        in stature. This feature will be referred to later. Again, all the evidence 
        goes to show that, though native or inborn faculties are hereditary, mental 
        acquisitions or the results of education or experience are <em>not</em> 
        transmitted any more than those of the bodily organs. If such acquisitions 
        were transmitted, we should expect the younger sons of great men to possess 
        their fathers' abilities to a greater degree than the elder sons, since 
        they should inherit some of the ability <font color="#990000">[[p. 12]]</font> 
        due to the practice of the father's art or profession for a longer period; 
        but no such constant difference has ever been detected. Still more conclusive 
        is the fact that the children of English, French, or German parents, whose 
        ancestors for many generations have spoken each their own tongue, do not 
        show any exceptional power of learning their own rather than another language; 
        and this applies in cases where the speech is most diverse, as when a 
        European infant is reared among Hindoos or Red Indians. These various 
        considerations render it almost certain that the phenomena of heredity 
        and variation are fundamentally the same in the mental as in the physical 
        departments of human nature. This being the case, we must assume that 
        character (which is really the aggregate of the intellectual and moral 
        faculties), in order to be progressively developed, must be acted upon 
        by some form of natural selection. We have seen, however, that this power 
        only acts--can only act--by the survival of individuals which possess 
        the more <em>useful</em> developments. It follows that those special faculties 
        which build up character can only be preserved and increased inasmuch 
        as they are of use to the individual or to the race, and this <em>utility</em> 
        must be of such a nature as in times of stress or danger to be of <em>life-preserving 
        value</em>. We must, therefore, proceed to inquire in what way and to 
        what extent character has been, or is being, modified or advanced.</p>
      <p align="center">THE EVOLUTION OF CHARACTER IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND IN THE 
        RACE.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every evolutionist now believes that man has 
        arisen from the lower animals by a process of modification, in the same 
        way as any species of animal has arisen from its ancestral forms. He is 
        the culminating point of the whole vast fabric of the organic world. If 
        he has not so arisen, but is the product of other unknown forces guided 
        by infinite power, then the slow development of the infinitely varied 
        forms of nature that preceded his advent appears to be unmeaning. But 
        if there is any purpose in the universe, if nature and man are not the 
        chance products of primeval forces, we must conclude that the process 
        by which man has actually been developed is the best, perhaps the only 
        possible, mode of producing him. From this point of view everything is 
        harmonious and intelligible. The end to be attained, required, and justified, 
        the countless ages of preparation, of which we obtain some imperfect knowledge 
        in the geological record. The varied forms of vegetable and animal life 
        which filled the earth when man first appeared afforded him the means 
        of life, not in one part only, but over the whole terrestrial surface. 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 13]]</font> As he advanced in knowledge and 
        increased in population, an ever-increasing proportion of plants and animals 
        became of use to him, first for food, then for weapons, for clothing, 
        for houses, for utensils; and later on for comfort and luxury, as aids 
        to his mental development or to charm him by their beauty. The marvellous 
        phenomena of nature, from the glittering hosts of heaven to the exquisite 
        panorama of the seasons on the earth, awoke in him the desire for knowledge; 
        and, as time went on, ever more and more of the secrets of nature were 
        revealed to him, ever more and more of her powers were utilised, an ever-increasing 
        proportion of the animal and vegetable and mineral worlds became subservient 
        to his needs, or gratified his intellectual or &aelig;sthetic or moral 
        faculties. Yet more, if there is a purpose in the universe, if the organic 
        world came into existence in order that man might exist, then we must 
        also recognise purpose in that infinite <em>variety</em> of nature, whether 
        animate or inanimate, which has furnished such an inexhaustible supply 
        of everything necessary for his life and happiness, and for the progressive 
        development of his intellectual and moral nature. We can believe (and 
        not be afraid to acknowledge our belief) that the dog and the cat, the 
        sheep and the cow, the horse and the ass, the fowl and the pigeon, the 
        throstle and the nightingale, the orange and the apple, the strawberry 
        and the vine, wheat and maize, pine-tree and oak, and all the myriad luscious 
        fruits and fragrant flowers and glorious blossoms, and infinitely varied 
        mineral and chemical products--all alike exist as parts of the great design 
        of human development.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here again we obtain further indications 
        of purpose in the very method of organic as distinct from that of inorganic 
        evolution. The two great distinctive features of living substance--enormous 
        powers of increase together with gradual but almost unlimited variability 
        (features that are absent from the entire inorganic universe)--necessarily 
        lead to the rapid spread of life over the whole area that is not absolutely 
        unfitted for it, and at the same time give rise to an ever-increasing 
        variety of forms and complexity of structure, in adaptation to the ever-changing 
        conditions of the earth's surface. Thus the whole earth and ocean have 
        become filled with continually varying and progressing forms of life, 
        so that when the cosmic process culminated in man, with faculties and 
        aspirations calculated to utilise and appreciate them, it also culminated 
        in those highest developments of the animal and vegetable worlds which 
        we have briefly enumerated and which certainly never existed together 
        in equal variety and beauty, at any earlier period of the earth's history.</p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#990000">[[p. 14]]</font> IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE 
        OF<br />
        PROGRESSIVE IMPROVEMENT IN CHARACTER?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though it is admitted that man has arisen 
        from a lower animal form, we have still to inquire whether his whole intellectual, 
        &aelig;sthetic, and moral nature has been produced by the action of the 
        very same laws and processes as have led to the development of animal 
        forms and animal natures. Does variation and survival of the fittest explain 
        man's mind as well as his body? Does he differ from the lower animals 
        in degree only, or is there an essential difference in his mental nature?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that from brute to man there has 
        been a great advance. This is universally admitted. But that there has 
        been any very great advance from the earliest men of whom we have any 
        records and ourselves, is by no means generally admitted and certainly 
        cannot be proved.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have myself shown that the great first step 
        that caused man to rise above his fellow animals was that amount of mental 
        superiority that enabled him to obtain some command over nature. After 
        showing how each animal form could only preserve its existence in a changing 
        universe by corresponding changes in bodily structure or in the lower 
        mental faculties, I go on to describe what occurred in the case of man:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;
      </p><blockquote><font size="-1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;At length, however, 
        there came into existence a being in whom the subtle force we term <em>mind</em>, 
        became of more importance than his mere bodily structure. Though with 
        a naked and unprotected body, <em>this</em> gave him clothing against 
        the varying inclemencies of the seasons. Though unable to compete with 
        the deer in swiftness or with the wild bull in strength, <em>this</em> 
        gave him weapons with which to capture or overcome both. Though less capable 
        than most other animals of living on the herbs and fruits that unaided 
        nature supplies, this wonderful faculty taught him to govern and direct 
        nature to his own benefit, and make her produce food for him when and 
        where he needed. From the moment when the first skin was used for a covering, 
        when the first rude spear was formed to assist in the chase, when fire 
        was first used to cook his food, when the first seed was sown or shoot 
        planted, a grand revolution was effected in nature--a revolution which 
        in all the previous ages of the earth's history had had no parallel--for 
        a being had arisen who was no longer necessarily subject to physical change 
        with the changing universe, a being who was in some degree superior to 
        nature, inasmuch as he knew how to control and regulate her action, and 
        could keep himself in harmony with her, not by a change in body, but by 
        an advance in mind.&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></font></blockquote>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 15]]</font> Now this 
        passage, first published in 1864, seems to me to indicate the essential 
        superiority of man over the lower animals, a superiority which was perhaps 
        as great fundamentally in pal&aelig;olithic or eolithic man as it is now. 
        All that we have done since, all the triumphs of our civilisation and 
        of our science, have arisen by slow, very slow, progressive steps, each 
        one only a little in advance of what had been done before, and none of 
        them perhaps so difficult, so clearly showing superiority of intellect, 
        as those marvellous first steps which proved that a new and a higher being 
        had appeared on the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Archdall Reid, in his work on Heredity already 
        referred to (in a very suggestive chapter on &quot;Racial Mental Differences&quot;) 
        adopts the views of Buckle and John Stuart Mill, that by far the larger 
        part of racial or national differences of character are <em>not</em> inherent, 
        but are the product of the diverse and highly complex environments of 
        each. This would include, of course, their past history, their religion, 
        their education, their form of government, and the various habits and 
        customs, language, legends and superstitions that have come down to them 
        from a forgotten past. In comparing a savage with a civilised race, we 
        must always remember that the amount of acquired and applied knowledge 
        which we possess is no criterion of mental superiority on our side, or 
        of inferiority on his. The average Zulu or Fijian may be very little lower 
        mentally than the average Englishman; and it is, I think, quite certain 
        that the average Briton, Saxon, Dane, and Norseman of a thousand years 
        ago--the ancestral stocks of the present English race--were mentally our 
        equals. For what power has been since at work to improve them? There has 
        certainly been no special survival of the more intellectual and moral, 
        but rather the reverse. As Galton points out, the celibacy of the Roman 
        Church and the seclusion of thousands of the more refined women in abbeys 
        and nunneries tended to brutalise the race.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this we must add the destruction of thousands 
        of psychics, many of them students and inventors, during the witchcraft 
        mania, and the repression of thought and intellect by the Inquisition; 
        and when we consider further that the effects of education and the arts 
        are not hereditary, we shall be forced to the conclusion that we are to-day, 
        in all probability, mentally and morally inferior to our semi-barbaric 
        ancestors!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back at the course of our history from 
        the Saxon invasion to the end of the nineteenth century, what single cause 
        can we allege for an advance in intellect and in moral nature? What selective 
        agency of &quot;survival value&quot; has ever been at work to preserve the wise 
        and good and to eliminate the stupid and <font color="#990000">[[p. 16]]</font> 
        the bad? And it must have certainly been a very powerful agency, acting 
        in a very systematic manner, even to neutralise the effect of the powerful 
        deteriorating agencies above referred to.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we remember that the Romans and the Greeks 
        looked down on <em>all</em> our ancestors as we look down on Kaffirs and 
        Red Indians, we must not too hastily conclude that, because people are 
        in the savage or barbarian state as regards knowledge and material civilisation, 
        they are necessarily inferior intellectually or morally. I am inclined 
        to believe that an unbiassed examination of the question would lead us 
        to the conclusion which, as I understand him, is favoured by Mr. Archdall 
        Reid, that there is no good evidence of any considerable improvement in 
        man's average intellectual and moral status during the whole period of 
        human history, nor any difference at all in that status corresponding 
        with differences in material civilisation between civilised and savage 
        races to-day. What differences actually exist are sufficiently accounted 
        for by various selective agencies known to have been at work; while there 
        is good reason to believe that some of the lowest savages to-day (perhaps 
        all of them) are the deteriorated remnants of more civilised peoples.</p>
      <p align="center">THE CHARACTER OF SAVAGES NOT NECESSARILY LOW.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we turn to the facts actually known to us 
        about early man, historic and prehistoric, they certainly point in the 
        same direction. Whence came the wonderful outgrowth of art manifested 
        by the Germans and Celts in their Gothic architecture, admirable alike 
        in structure, in design, and in ornament, and which we, however much we 
        pride ourselves on our science, cannot approach in either originality 
        or beauty? Going further back, the Roman architects, sculptors, poets, 
        and literary men were fully our equals. Still earlier, the Greeks were 
        our equals, if not superior in art, in literature and in philosophy. The 
        Aryans of Northern India were equally advanced, and their wonderful epic--the 
        Maha-Bharata--introduces us to a people who were probably both in intellect 
        and in morality no whit inferior to ourselves. Further back still, in 
        ancient Egypt, we find in the Great Pyramid a structure which is the oldest 
        in the world, and in many respects the most remarkable. In its geometrical 
        proportions, its orientation, and its marvellous accuracy of construction, 
        it is in itself the record of a people who had already attained to a degree 
        of high intellectual achievement. It was one of the most gigantic astronomical 
        observatories ever erected by man, and it shows such astronomical and 
        geometrical knowledge, such precision of structure, and such mechanical 
        skill, as to imply long ages of previous civilisation, and an amount of 
        intellect and love <font color="#990000">[[p. 17]]</font> of knowledge 
        fully equal to that of the greatest mathematicians, astronomers, and engineers 
        of our day.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if from the purely intellectual we turn 
        to the domain of conduct and of ethical standards, we encounter facts 
        which also lead us to the same conclusion. If we compare the two greatest 
        ethical teachers of our age with their earliest prototypes whose works 
        have been preserved, it is impossible to maintain that there has been 
        any real advance in their respective characters. Tolstoy can hardly be 
        ranked as higher than Buddha, or Ruskin than Confucius; and as we cannot 
        suppose the amount of variation of human faculty about a mean value to 
        be very different now from what it was at that remote era, we must conclude 
        that equality in the highest implies equality in the mean, and that human 
        nature on the whole has not advanced in intellect or in moral standards 
        during the last three thousand years, while the records of Egypt in both 
        departments--those of science and of ethics--enable us to extend the same 
        conclusion to a period some thousands of years earlier.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to this argument, it will be urged 
        that the period from these early civilisations to our own day is only 
        a fragment of man's whole history, and that in the remains of neolithic, 
        pal&aelig;olithic, and eolithic man, we have certain proofs that his earliest 
        condition was that of a low and brutal savage. But this is pure assumption, 
        because the evidence at our command does not bear upon the question at 
        issue. Material civilisation and inherent character are things which have 
        no necessary connection. There is no inconsistency, no necessary contradiction, 
        in the supposition that the men of the early stone age were our equals 
        intellectually and morally. As Mr. Archdall Reid well argues, if a potential 
        Newton or Darwin were occasionally born among savages, how could his faculties 
        manifest themselves in that forbidding environment? With an imperfect 
        language and limited notation, and having to maintain a constant struggle 
        for existence against the forces of nature, and in combination with his 
        fellows against wild beasts and human enemies, either of them might have 
        made some one step in advance--might have invented some new weapon or 
        constructed some improved trap. He must necessarily work on the lines 
        of his fellows and with the materials to his hand. Perhaps in the rude 
        drawings of animals on stone or tusk we have the work of a potential Land-seer; 
        while the equal of our Watt or Kelvin might have initiated the polished 
        stone axe or invented the bone needle. That a people without metals and 
        without written language, who could therefore leave few imperishable remains, 
        may yet possess an intellect and moral character fully equal (some observers 
        think <font color="#990000">[[p. 18]]</font> superior) to our own, is 
        demonstrated in the case of the Samoans, and some other tribes of the 
        Pacific, It is clear, therefore, that a low state of material civilisation 
        is no indication whatever of inferiority of character.</p>
      <p align="center">DIVERGENCE OF NATIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But although every indication of history and 
        of existing races of man negatives the idea of any general <em>advance</em> 
        of character, a conclusion which is supported by the entire absence of 
        any selective agency of &quot;survival value,&quot; which could alone have led to 
        such advance on the principles of organic evolution, yet there are undoubtedly 
        <em>differences</em> of national character which it is not easy to account 
        for. That, on the whole, the Celtic races are more idealistic, more joyous, 
        and more excitable than the Germanic or Sclavonian, while a similar difference 
        exists between the peoples of Southern and Northern Europe, seems to be 
        generally admitted. Buckle, as has been already noted, explained the difference 
        by the influence of the diverse environments, and Mr. Archdall Reid favours 
        the same view, but there are many difficulties connected with such a theory. 
        No doubt the best known Celtic races--the Bretons, the Welsh, the Cornish, 
        and the Highlanders--have been long the inhabitants of mountainous districts 
        to which they have been driven by the invasions of more warlike peoples; 
        but, unless some form of selection comes into play, it is difficult to 
        imagine why this should have changed the character of people who had presumably 
        lived at some earlier period in less awe-inspiring lands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the great argument against this explanation 
        is to be found, I think, in the diverse characters of two of the principal 
        divisions of mankind--the Mongoloid and the Negroid. Here we see that 
        great changes of natural environment have produced no corresponding modification 
        of character, and <em>vice</em> <em>vers&acirc;</em>. Every reader of 
        my <em>Malay Archipelago</em> will, I think, remember my description of 
        the Ke Islanders (typical Papuans and Negroids) and my comparison of their 
        behaviour with that of the Malays (equally typical Mongoloids), with whose 
        character I was so well acquainted. Now, the fundamental features of the 
        <em>characters</em> of these two great divisions of mankind maintain themselves 
        wherever they are found, in every variety of aspect and of climate, extending 
        over three-fourths of the globe. The Red Indians of America (true Mongoloids 
        for the most part) have the same impassive, unexcitable character in the 
        frigid, the tropical, and the temperate zones; whether they inhabit the 
        forests or the plains, the great river valleys or the lofty plateaux; 
        and the same may be said of the Old World branch from the Japanese and 
        Chinese <font color="#990000">[[p. 19]]</font> to the Kalmucks and Malays; 
        and, throughout these vast diversities of natural environment it cannot 
        be said that any minor diversities of character can be positively traced 
        to local influences. In the case of the Malays and Papuans, we have the 
        two races existing under almost identical circumstances in the vast equatorial 
        forests extending from Sumatra to the Solomon Islands, often living in 
        a very similar manner and in an almost identical stage of barbarism; yet 
        it is in this very region that their distinctive mental characteristics 
        are to be found to be at a maximum. For such a mental divergence as these 
        two races present, I cannot myself see any possibility of an explanation 
        through any selective agency of &quot;survival value&quot;; while the influence 
        of environment is equally untenable, besides being in direct opposition 
        to the now well-established principle of the non-heredity of acquired 
        peculiarities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this undoubted difference of racial character, 
        and perhaps to an even greater extent in that of national character, the 
        mental divergence seems to exceed the physical. The former better corresponds 
        to the amount of mental difference between different species, genera, 
        or even families of animals than to those presented by mere varieties 
        of a single species; and in this way we have an indication of a want of 
        parallelism or of direct relationship of the mental and the physical characteristics 
        of mankind, which may, perhaps, offer us a clue to this most complex and 
        important problem. Among individuals we see the same phenomenon, though 
        we have no means of accurately estimating it. The amount of divergence 
        in the physical features of healthy and equally well-nourished and well-trained 
        individuals in the same country is not very great. In stature, strength, 
        speed of running, and acuteness of the senses, the divergence from the 
        mean is rarely more than as two to three, and in the most extreme cases 
        does not exceed two to one. But in the mental faculties, or in any special 
        faculty, the divergence would be usually estimated at a much higher figure. 
        There are thousands of mathematicians among us to-day whose capacities 
        would certainly be estimated at five or six times greater than that of 
        other thousands who can never understand comparatively simple arithmetical 
        or geometrical problems, while the extreme cases of the highest mathematical 
        genius and the lowest degree of arithmetical stupidity would be estimated 
        as at least some such proportion as 100 to 1, if not much higher; and 
        in every other department of human faculty--music, poetry, or eloquence--there 
        is perhaps a nearly equal amount of divergence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may, I think, explain this circumstance by 
        the consideration that, while the physical characteristics must have been 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 20]]</font> rigidly selected during the earlier 
        period of man's existence on the earth, through his constant struggle 
        with the lower animals and against the forces of nature, and later on 
        almost equally so in war or competition with other tribes or races, his 
        higher mental faculties were seldom or never called into action, being 
        of no direct use to him in the struggle for existence. While the former, 
        therefore, became fixed within definite limits, the latter were free to 
        vary in amount through the agency of some unknown laws or inherent capacities. 
        The extraordinary thing is, that these higher faculties did not become 
        atrophied by disuse as would physical characters under similar conditions; 
        instead of which they appear to have persisted undiminished in power throughout 
        all human history, ready under favourable conditions to blaze out in a 
        Homer or a Socrates, a Pyramid designer or a Buddha, an Archimedes or 
        a Shakespeare.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the greatest upholders of the theory 
        of natural selection admit that these higher faculties cannot have been 
        developed through its agency. In an elaborate essay on <em>The Musical 
        Sense in Man and Animals</em>, Weismann comes to the conclusion that the 
        musical sense &quot;is simply a by-product or accessory of the auditory organ,&quot; 
        and that it is &quot;a merely incidental production, and thus, in a certain 
        sense, an unintended one.&quot; In another work (his lecture on <em>Heredity</em>) 
        he arrives at a similar conclusion with regard to all the higher activities 
        of the mind in the following statement:--&quot;In my opinion, talents do not 
        appear to depend upon the improvement of any special mental quality by 
        continual practice, but they are the expression, and to a certain extent 
        the by-product, of the human mind, which is so highly developed in all 
        directions.&quot; Huxley arrived at a somewhat similar conclusion, being reported 
        by Mr. Wilfred Ward as saying:--&quot;One thing which weighs with me against 
        pessimism, and tells for a benevolent author of the universe, is, my enjoyment 
        of scenery and of music. I do not see how they can have helped in the 
        struggle for existence. They are gratuitous gifts.&quot;</p>
      <p align="center">WHAT FACULTIES HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND IMPROVED?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though there has, apparently, been no continuous 
        advance in the higher intellectual and moral nature of man for want of 
        any selective agency leading to such a result, this has not been the case 
        with that portion of his faculties which he possesses in common with the 
        lower animals. The family affections, and the social instincts, were essential 
        to the safety of the clan or the tribe; courage and perseverance, cautiousness 
        and decision, were valuable in hunting and in war; the inventive and constructive 
        faculties were of value in the making of weapons and <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        21]]</font> snares, clothing and houses, while foresight, and the love 
        of animals, might lead to the simpler forms of agricultural industry. 
        These, however, could hardly have arisen till after the invention of weapons 
        and of tools, as well as the discovery of the use of fire, and it is by 
        no means easy to see how natural selection alone, which can only produce 
        modifications in accordance with an animal's needs, never beyond them, 
        could have led to that mental superiority which at once placed man so 
        far above all other animals, and have endowed him with such capacities 
        for advancement as he actually possessed.</p>
      <p align="center">CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN CHARACTER.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sketch which has now been given of 
        the actual powers of the human mind, and of the various influences which 
        may conceivably have modified it, we have been led to some very startling 
        conclusions. We see, first, that the general idea that our enormous advances 
        in science and command over nature serve as demonstrations of our mental 
        superiority to the men of earlier ages, is totally unfounded. The evidence 
        of history and of the earliest monuments alike go to indicate that our 
        intellectual and moral nature has not advanced in any perceptible degree. 
        In the second place, we find that the supposed great mental inferiority 
        of savages is equally unfounded. The more they are sympathetically studied, 
        the more they are found to resemble ourselves in their inherent intellectual 
        powers. Even the so-long-despised Australians--almost the lowest in material 
        progress--yet show by their complex language, their elaborate social regulations, 
        and often by an innate nobility of character, indications of a very similar 
        inner nature to our own. If they possess fewer philosophers and moralists, 
        they are also free from so large a proportion of unbalanced minds--idiots 
        and lunatics--as we possess. On the other hand, we find in the higher 
        Pacific types, men who, though savages as regards material progress, are 
        yet generally admitted to be--physically, intellectually, and morally--our 
        equals, if not our superiors. These we are rapidly exterminating through 
        the effect of <em>our</em> boasted civilisation!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have no proof whatever that even 
        the men of the stone age were mentally or morally inferior to ourselves. 
        The case of the Pacific Islanders shows that simple arts and constructions 
        with the absence of written language affords no proof of inferiority; 
        while the undoubted absence of any selective power of &quot;survival value&quot; 
        adequate to the evolution of the higher intellectual, &aelig;sthetic, 
        and moral faculties--which we find so fully developed in Ancient India, 
        Egypt, and Greece--indicates that the very earliest men of whose existence 
        we have any certain <font color="#990000">[[p. 22]]</font> knowledge must 
        also have possessed these faculties. If they did not possess them there 
        must have been progressive mental progress independent of selection and 
        without any intelligible cause.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other characteristic of man which supports 
        this conclusion is, as already shown, the extreme variability of his whole 
        mental and moral nature, a variability much greater than that present 
        in his body; and this again indicates that there has been no selective 
        agency adequate to limit its range or guide it in any special direction.</p>
      <p align="center">CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF HUMAN CHARACTER.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preceding considerations lead us to conclude 
        that the higher mental or spiritual nature of man is not the mere animal 
        nature advanced through survival of the fittest. All the greatest writers 
        and thinkers on the subject now admit this. In the last chapter of my 
        <em>Darwinism</em> I have shown that some of the bodily characteristics 
        of man are similarly inexplicable as the result of the same selective 
        process. Darwin himself declared that the law of natural selection was, 
        in his opinion, the greatest but not the exclusive means of modification.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me it appears that, just as gravitation rules 
        the whole material universe, so natural selection rules, and has ruled, 
        the whole organic world. But in the countless modifications of matter, 
        other quite distinct forces control or antagonise gravitation. Molecular 
        and chemical forces, within their sphere of action, are far more powerful, 
        and entirely neutralise the effect of the more far-reaching agency. Electricity 
        and other ethereal forces are still more powerful; and, as seen at work 
        in cometary emanations, oppose and overcome the gravitative force of the 
        sun.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In like manner we see in the organic world a 
        new and higher series of powers at work. First, in the life-force that 
        renders possible the whole marvellous structure, growth, and products 
        of the vegetable kingdom; next, in the higher life of consciousness and 
        purposive action, as manifested in the lower animals; and, lastly, in 
        the still higher spiritual nature--a little lower than that of the angels--with 
        which man is endowed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence whatever that any of the 
        animal forms below man possess the germs of this higher nature, however 
        intelligent and teachable many of them undoubtedly are. Had they possessed 
        it, some of them would have given indications of it. Such very diverse 
        animals as the cat and the dog, the horse and the elephant, the monkey 
        and the chimpanzee, exhibit a nearly equal amount of animal intelligence, 
        but none of them <font color="#990000">[[p. 23]]</font> can be said to 
        be decidedly superior to the rest, none show any clear signs of the possession 
        of even the rudiments of those faculties which raise man so infinitely 
        above them all, or even of those much lower yet still essential powers, 
        which enabled man, as soon as he became man, to develop language, to utilise 
        fire, to make tools and weapons, to sow seeds, and to become shepherd 
        and herdsman.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the epoch when man first attained to 
        his specially human powers, he not only at once assumed command over the 
        earth and all its forms of life, but commenced that development of latent 
        faculties of which we find such striking evidences throughout history. 
        The whole universe, in all its myriad forms, in all its intricacies of 
        structure and motion, in all its marvellous beauty and inexhaustible utilities, 
        in all its complex and mysterious laws and forces, became to him a vast 
        school-room, furnishing the materials needed for the development of all 
        his hitherto unused faculties and for the gradual elevation of his intellectual 
        and moral nature. But the possibilities of such development must have 
        pre-existed; the germs must have been present; every faculty must have 
        been latent, or no amount of marvel and mystery could have called them 
        forth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How this higher nature originated in man, we 
        may never know; but all the evidence points in the direction of some spiritual 
        influx analogous to that which first initiated the organised life of the 
        plant; then the consciousness and intelligence of the animal; and, lastly, 
        reason, the sense of beauty, the love of justice, the passion for truth, 
        the aspiration towards a higher life which everywhere, though in varying 
        degrees, characterise the Human Race.</p>
      <p align="center">THE POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT OF CHARACTER.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, as we have seen, there has been no 
        general advance of character during the whole period of which we can obtain 
        any definite information, due to the absence of any great or constant 
        selective agency, there is every reason to believe that it will be so 
        improved in the not distant future. The heights to which it has attained 
        in a few rare examples in all ages, taken in connection with the enormous 
        range of variation it presents at the present time, show us that ample 
        materials exist for raising its present average almost indefinitely. This 
        can be effected by two distinct influences, which can and must always 
        work together--education and selection by marriage. As yet we have no 
        true and effective education. The very first essential in the teacher--true 
        love of, or any sympathy with, the children--is not made one of the conditions 
        of entering that great profession. Till this is made the <em>primary</em> 
        qualification (as it <font color="#990000">[[p. 24]]</font> was by Robert 
        Owen at his schools in New Lanark) no real improvement in social and moral 
        character can be effected. Mere intellectual instruction--which is all 
        now given--is <em>not</em> a complete education, is really the least important 
        half of it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other and more permanently effective agency, 
        selection through marriage, will come into operation only when a greatly 
        improved social system renders all our women economically and socially 
        free to choose; while a rational and complete education will have taught 
        them the importance of their choice both to themselves and to humanity. 
        This subject I have treated in my <em>Studies</em> (see the chapter on 
        &quot;Human Selection&quot;). It will act through the agency of well-known facts 
        and principles of human nature, leading to a continuous reduction of the 
        lower types in each successive generation, and it is the only mode yet 
        suggested which will automatically and naturally effect this.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we consider the enormous importance of 
        such a continuous improvement in the average character, and that our widespread 
        and costly religious and educational agencies have, so far, made not the 
        slightest advance towards it, we shall, perhaps, realise, before it is 
        too late, that we have begun at the wrong end. Improvement of social conditions 
        must precede improvement of character; and only when we have so reorganised 
        society as to abolish the cruel and debasing struggle for existence and 
        for wealth that now prevails, shall we be enabled to liberate those beneficent 
        natural forces which alone can elevate character.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great lesson taught us by this brief exposition 
        of the phenomena of character in relation to the known laws of organic 
        evolution is this: that our imperfect human nature, with its almost infinite 
        possibilities of good and evil, can only make a systematic advance through 
        the thoroughly sympathetic and ethical training of every child from infancy 
        upwards, combined with that perfect freedom of choice in marriage which 
        will only be possible when all are economically equal, and no question 
        of social rank or material advantage can have the slightest influence 
        in determining that choice.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our workers, our thinkers, our legislators 
        can be persuaded to accept these fundamental truths, and make them the 
        twin guiding stars of their aspirations and their efforts, the onward 
        march towards true civilisation will have begun, and for the first time 
        in the history of mankind, his Character--his very Human Nature itself--will 
        be improved by the slow but certain action of a pure and beautiful form 
        of selection--a selection which will act, not through struggle and death, 
        but through brotherhood and love.</p>

        <i><font color="993366"><strong>Comment by Kathleen Lowrey, Dept. of Anthropology, University of Alberta (pers. commun. 6/2012):</strong></font></i> 
      </p><p align="left"><em>Wallace  is characteristically prescient and idiosyncratic here. Some of the ideas he  articulates in &quot;Evolution and Character&quot; are similar to what Adolf Bastian in  the late nineteenth century called the &quot;psychic unity of mankind,&quot; and to what anthropologists  across the twentieth century came to insist on: the uniformity of human  intellectual and moral capacities across geographical space and historic and  prehistoric time. Others are out of step with twentieth century anthropological  thought, as when Wallace attributes striking differences among &ldquo;nations&rdquo; (the  excitable Celt, the cold German and Slav, the impassive &quot;Mongoloid,&quot; the  high-spirited &quot;Negroid&quot;) to inherent character. Wallace articulates as a  disjuncture what twentieth century anthropologists have conjoined under the  notion of &quot;culture&quot;: that one thing that all humans share across time and space  that is different everywhere and in every period.</em></p>
      <p align="left"><em>Wallace  takes these variations of &quot;national character&quot; as examples writ large of a contradictory  quality of human mentality, which is at once more uniform and more diverse than  can be well explained within the utility-driven and -constrained framework of  natural selection. Here as elsewhere, he resolves the puzzle with recourse to  spiritual intervention into the otherwise-material workings of the biological  world. For most of the twentieth century, anthropologists have invoked a  secular counterpart: culture. Wallace's solution to the puzzle is explanatory  without being scientifically defensible; anthropology's solution to the puzzle  is scientifically defensible without being explanatory.</em></p>
      <p align="left"><em>In  anthropology, the capacity for culture is posited as both the key evolutionary event in the  human story and as the effective end of evolutionary events for humans. This  capacity for culture--to creatively use communication, technology, and social  organization in endlessly innovative and recombinant ways--is an evolutionary  transformation that has allowed humans to slip many of the coils of evolution itself;  to all be different and yet all be the same ever since. How did this happen,  and how has it been sustained across time and space? &quot;Culture&quot; is an  explanatory black box: diverse proto-humans go in, all different, and only  humans come out, still diverse, within and across populations, but also all the  same. Physical anthropological, archaeological, and ethnographic evidence combine  to demonstrate that this is a good description of the observable facts. But it  is not an explanation of them. In this 1908 essay, Wallace grapples with a  serious anthropological question that more than a century on remains unanswered.</em></p>

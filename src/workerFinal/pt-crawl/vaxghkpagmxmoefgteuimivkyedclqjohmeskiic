      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><b>Introduction<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Totally herbivorous 
        lizards are found in three disjunct regions: (1) the New World tropics 
        northward into the Mojave Desert of the SW United States (all the Inguaninae 
        but two species), (2) the Near the Middle East from North Africa to Southwest 
        Asia (spiny tailed agamids <i>Uromastyx</i>); and (3) the tropical Far 
        East in the Fiji Islands (the banded iguanas <i>Brachylophus</i>), the 
        Philippines and Indonesia (water lizards <i>Hydrosaurus</i>) and the Solomon 
        Islands (giant skinks <i>Corusia</i>). They are found on islands as well 
        as continents, in predator-filled to nearly predator-free environments, 
        in xeric (most), mesic, and hydric habitats, and they include both oviparous 
        and viviparous (only <i>Corusia</i>) forms.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Perhaps 
        the most unique characteristic of the lizards of the sub-family Iguaninae 
        is their success at herbivorousness. Unfortunately, complete, reliable 
        data on diet and feeding habits for most of the iguanines are not available; 
        most of the published information is only anecdotal, and, in some cases 
        (see below), clearly misleading. Intrigued by my own observations that 
        the ground iguana, <i>Cyclura carinata</i>, is almost totally herbivorous 
        from hatching through adulthood (a weight range of 15 to 1900 g), I began 
        examining lizard herbivory in terms of diet, feeding habits, feeding strategies, 
        and adaptational correlates (both morphological and physiological). By 
        looking simultaneously at all of these aspects of herbivory, I hoped to 
        better understand the mechanisms involved in its evolution in lizards.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Diet<br>
        </font> </b> For purposes of this discussion I consider as &quot;truly 
        herbivorous&quot; (i.e., on the far right of the [carnivory-omnivory-herbivory] 
        continuum) only those species whose diets include essentially only vegetation 
        (whether fruit, flowers, seeds or foliage) throughout the year. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many species 
        generally called &quot;herbivorous&quot; are probably facultative herbivores 
        at best, and more likely, simple omnivores. Based on the literature and 
        my own dissections of several hundred lizard species, [most] such forms 
        [species names omitted] although often termed herbivorous in the literature 
        are clearly not true herbivores. In fact, by my definition, the only totally 
        herbivorous extant lizards are the iguanines (+/- 30 species among the 
        Iguanidae), the genera <i>Uromastyx</i>, <i>Hydrosaurus</i> among the 
        Agamidae, and <i>Corucia zebrata</i> in the Scincidae. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">I have 
        also found no basis for earlier speculations that the iguanines <i>Amblyrhynchus 
        cristatus</i>, <i>Cyclura nubila</i>, <i>Iguana</i>, and <i>Dipsosaurus 
        dorsalis</i>, and the agamid <i>Uromastyx hardwicki</i> exhibit an ontogenetic 
        shift from carnivory to herbivory [eating animal protein as juveniles, 
        adopting an herbivorous diet as adult]. Most of these suggestions were 
        based: (1) on diet information from captive lizards, or (2) on anecdotal 
        field observations. In fact, of all the true herbivores I have dissected, 
        only the iguanine <i>Ctenosaura similis</i> showed any indication of an 
        omnivorous juvenile diet. Further field study will be necessary to establish 
        quantitatively the extent of this omnivory by size and season (for <i>C. 
        similis</i>). I thus conclude that an ontogenic shift from carnivory to 
        herbivory is not usual in lizards truly herbivorous as adults, and further, 
        that the documentation of such a transition (as appears to be the case 
        for <i>C. similis</i>) will at best be the very rare exception rather 
        than the rule.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Feeding 
        Ecology<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Other than 
        Auffenberg's work, studies of the ecological aspects of feeding in herbivorous 
        lizards have received little attention. However, it is known that herbivorous 
        lizards spend the majority of their activity cycle resting, not feeding 
        or foraging as do most carnivorous lizards or mammalian herbivores. Moberly 
        estimated that <i>Iguana</i> spends 90% of its time resting, and Beverly 
        Dugan estimated that the same species spent 96% of the day inactive and 
        only 1% feeding.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Despite 
        the apparent abundance of plant food, availability of food resources may 
        be the primary limiting factor for populations of many iguanine lizards 
        species. For example, in Columbia, Mueller has shown that green iguanas 
        inhabiting strongly seasonal habitats are smaller than those in less seasonal 
        habitats. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Rand has 
        suggested that food may be limiting to <i>Iguana iguana</i> in highly 
        seasonal tropical habitats only during part of the year. Further, even 
        during times of maximum primary productivity, i.e., times when high quality 
        foods (e.g., fruits) are most abundant, lizards can only eat and assimilate 
        as much as their digestive machinery can process. Because of the low relative 
        metabolic rats and daily fluctuations in body temperatures, this machinery 
        may well limit energy intake even at maximum efficiency.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Digestive 
        Physiology<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Other physiological 
        aspects of lizard herbivory have received some attention. For example, 
        digestive efficiencies of carnivorous lizards are known to vary typically 
        from 70 to 90% and to exceed significantly those of herbivorous lizards, 
        which normally range from 30-70%.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Trophic 
        Adaptations<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> All true 
        herbivorous lizards, regardless of family, are specialized in that they 
        all share one significant morphological adaptation (and a suite of associated 
        physiological and ecological ones) found in no other living lizards: all 
        have a distinctly enlarged, partitioned colon. All iguanine lizards except 
        <i>Amblyrhynchus cristatus</i> [whose valves differ from the others only 
        in height of the folds with no true valves] possess from one to eleven 
        transverse valves in the proximal colon. Valves are of two kinds, circular 
        or semilunar, and circular valves (if present) always occur proximally 
        to semilunar valves. There is no ontogenetic change in the number or the 
        kind of valves.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Colons 
        of unknown species can nearly always be allocated at least to genus, based 
        solely on morphology of that organ. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps 
        the most intriguing thing about iguanine colic variation is the significant 
        linear relationship between number of valves and mean body size for interspecific 
        comparisons. The larger the species, the more complex is the colon (i.e., 
        the more colic compartments present).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The partitioned 
        colon surely slows the passage of digesta through the gut, and relative 
        absorptive surface area (for water and nutrients) is certainly increased. 
        But the presence of tremendously dense nematode faunas (and presumably 
        bacterial and protozoan populations) in the normal cecum of all these 
        herbivorous lizards suggest that they provide important microhabitats 
        for colic (cellulytic?) symbionts. These nematodes (families Atracidae 
        and Oxyuridae) have direct life cycle, and eggs are likely ingested during 
        substrate licking, geophagy or coprophagy--behaviors frequently observed 
        in these lizards. Significantly, these heavy worm burdens are typical 
        of herbivorous lizards, where as such burdens are not found in omnivorous 
        or carnivorous lizards.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The tremendous 
        nematode densities in healthy lizards suggest they are not parasitic, 
        but rather commensalistic, or perhaps even mutualistic. Potential roles 
        for these nematodes include (1) the simple mixing and mechanical breakdown 
        of vegetation, effectively increasing the surface area of digesta particles; 
        (2) the production of useable waste products (vitamins, cellulose, volatile 
        fatty acids?); and/or (3) the regulation of the composition and/or abundance 
        of colonic microbes (on which some nematodes are known to feed).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Gastrointestinal 
        tract modification for symbiont culture is also the norm in herbivorous 
        organisms that have previously been studied. Colonic partitioning in herbivorous 
        lizards is thus by no means novel. What is surprising is the lack of attention 
        it has received especially since it appears to be the one adaptation essential 
        for a lizard's completely herbivorous existence.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Body 
        Size<br>
        </font> </b> True herbivorous lizards share another obvious character. 
        Excluding the varanids (which are very specialized carnivores), they are 
        the largest extant lizards. [Hypotheses which explain the adaptive significance 
        of body size and herbivory include] the greater mechanical strength [needed] 
        for reducing vegetation for consumption (although there is no mastication); 
        the advantage of reduced predation and competition; the advantage of eating 
        easily obtainable foods of medium to poor quality (i.e., plants) rather 
        than high quality food items (i.e., insects) more energentically costly 
        to obtain (since metabolic rates are relatively lower in large lizards); 
        and the advantage of greater thermal inertia, allowing the maintenance 
        of elevated body temperatures and facilitating the digestion of vegetation. 
        Each of these theories relates selective advantages which no doubt accrue 
        to large, herbivorous lizards, but none appears to fully explain the body 
        size-herbivory relationship in these lizards. I here extend another hypothesis 
        which I think more adequately explains the body size-herbivory correlation 
        and permits speculation on the evolution of these characteristics in lizards. 
        I believe that the anatomical, physiological, and ecological characteristics 
        of the gastrointestinal tract are the most important determinants, not 
        only of herbivorous capabilities, but also of body size in these lizards.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Previous 
        studies on both lizards and turtles have shown that body size may be significantly 
        related to resource availability. Analogously, I believe that the evolutionary 
        increase in colon complexity has increased resource usability (not necessarily 
        availability!), and thereby energetically permitted increased body size. 
        Thus colon modification (and the diversification and increase in the intestinal 
        flora and fauna), these herbivores have been able to grow to larger sizes, 
        and thus more fully gain other selective advantages, such as reduced predation, 
        metabolic and thermoregulatory benefits.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Discussion<br>
        </font> </b> I believe that the iguanines, <i>Uromastyx</i>, <i>Hydrosaurus</i> 
        and <i>Corucia</i> are much more specialized that generally realized. 
        Each has a relatively large body size and a modified colon with large 
        nematode and microbe populations--a combination of characters unique among 
        the lizards. In addition, although I have not mentioned them, these lizards 
        all possess dentition modified for herbivory and (apparently) nasal salt 
        glands for extrarenal salt secretion. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">These last 
        two characteristics are shared by lizards which are not entirely herbivorous, 
        however they nevertheless facilitate an herbivorous existence: teeth for 
        efficient cropping and salt glands for dealing with the increased potassium 
        load.</font></p>

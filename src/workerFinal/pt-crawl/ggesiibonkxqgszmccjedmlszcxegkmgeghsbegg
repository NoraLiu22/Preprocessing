                <h2><font size="3">By Mike Dorning<br>
                Chicago Tribune </font></h2>
                <p><font size="2"><i>Published in The Orlando
                Sentinel, April 1, 1998</i></font> </p>
                <p>WASHINGTON -- Efforts to overhaul the nation's
                Depression Era banking laws suffered a possibly
                fatal setback in the House of Representatives
                Tuesday evening. </p>
                <p>And though the banking industry generally
                detests the restrictive laws and has fought for
                at three decades for their removal, <font color="#cc0000">it was a
                lobbying campaign by banks that stopped an
                overhaul of the 65-year-old Glass-Steagall Act. </font></p>
                <p>A visibly angry Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.,
                withdrew the legislative package after it became
                clear there were insufficient votes to pass a
                procedural motion to bring the measure to the
                House floor. </p>
                <p>In pulling the bill, Solomon attributed the
                lack of support to a ``lobbying effort I've never
                seen before in my life.'' </p>
                <p>``Your friendly neighborhood banker has been
                on the phone all day,'' he said after what was
                clearly a defeat for the majority Republicans who
                had championed the legislation. </p>
                <p>Were it to be enacted, the banking legislation
                would speed up changes in the financial industry
                that already have blurred the distinctions among
                banks, stock brokerages and insurance companies.
                Many of the remaining legal barriers separating
                those businesses would be removed. </p>
                <p>Proponents of the measure envision it moving
                the nation closer to ``one-stop'' financial
                shopping, with brokerages such as Merrill Lynch
                competing head-on with banks such as NBD-First
                Chicago Corp. and offering the same panoply of
                services: everything from life insurance to
                mutual funds to checking accounts. </p>
                <p>But federal regulators and the Supreme Court
                already have been chipping away bit by bit at
                banking law restrictions in recent years. </p>
                <p>Bankers, chafing at some of the restrictions
                included in the House legislation, ultimately
                reasoned they could do better by working through
                regulators to circumvent existing restrictions. </p>
                <p>They were joined in their opposition by the
                Clinton administration. The White House
                threatened a veto and complained the measure
                would disadvantage small banks with ``needless
                costs'' and would undermine regulations intended
                to steer investment into poorer communities. </p>
                <p>Congressional leaders said they planned to
                bring up the legislation again in May, and
                Banking Committee Chairman James Leach, R-Iowa,
                said he expected to reconsider some of the more
                contentious provisions in the bill. </p>
                <p>But any delay cuts the chances the measure
                will gain passage by both chambers before
                Congress adjourns this fall. </p>
                <p>The Senate Banking Committee has not yet acted
                on the legislation. Its chairman, Sen. Alfonse
                D'Amato, R-N.Y., has said he will not take up the
                package unless the House passes it with both
                broad and bipartisan support. </p>
                <p>Solomon, the powerful chairman of the House
                Rules Committee, also left the debate embittered.
                </p>
                <p>A member of the committee quoted him as
                telling colleagues on the panel, ``You'll never
                see that bill again. The bankers are so greedy.''
                </p>
                <p>The defeat was an embarrassment for Republican
                leaders, who had pushed hard for its passage and
                highlighted the legislation as a priority by
                making it one of the first 10 bills introduced
                this Congress. </p>
                <p>Sensing weak support, the GOP leadership
                sought to bolster the measure's chances by
                attaching a politically popular measure
                protecting credit unions from a recent
                unfavorable Supreme Court decision. </p>
                <p><font color="#CC0000">But backing for the bill crumbled. Three key
                Republicans, Reps. Bill McCollum of Florida,
                Richard Baker of Louisiana and David Dreier of
                California, announced their opposition in a
                letter arguing language in the bill ``places
                significant new burdens on financial services
                firms to the detriment of their customers.'' </font></p>
                <p>Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the House
                Commerce Committee's top Democrat, also came out
                against the measure after Republican leaders
                rejected a series of consumer protection measures
                he favored. He took with him any hope of
                substantial support from Democrats. </p>
                <p>The legislation was opposed by consumer
                groups, who argued it would lead to a further
                concentration of economic power. Groups such as
                the Consumers Union also contended that
                provisions loosening restrictions on bank
                ownership of unrelated commercial businesses
                could put insured deposits at risk. </p>
                <p>The package did receive strong support from
                insurance companies and brokerage houses and from
                Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. </p>
                <p>But all the while, bankers were on the phone,
                relaying their opposition to their congressional
                representatives. </p>
                <p>``I have a lot of small banks in my district.
                I've been hearing from all of them,'' said
                Peoria's Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. </p>
                <p>``People just had too much heartburn,'' LaHood
                added. </p>
                <p>Ed Yingling, a lobbyist for the American
                Bankers Association, said the industry's chief
                concerns with the package included a provision
                allowing state insurance regulators to override
                the decisions of national banking authorities, as
                long as a court did not find the regulations
                actively discriminated against banks. Each
                regulator tends to be more friendly to its own
                industry. </p>
                <p>Also high among the industry's concerns was a
                requirement that banks provide low-cost
                ``life-line checking'' to poorer customers, he
                said. </p>
                <p>Smaller banks generally considered too costly
                a holding company structure they would have to
                create to take advantage of some of the new
                powers available to them. </p>

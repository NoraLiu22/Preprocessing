/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 121]]</font> While 
        the general doctrine of evolution is nowhere more appreciated than among 
        American naturalists, the same can hardly be said for that particular 
        form of it which is usually known as Darwinism. For many years there has 
        been a tendency among the younger students of nature--those who have grown 
        up under the influence of the new ideas and the new methods of research 
        which have prevailed since the 'Origin of Species' was published--to be 
        dissatisfied with the doctrine of natural selection as an explanation 
        of the forms, structures, and complex relations of organized beings. While 
        admitting the reality and importance of Darwin's great discovery, they 
        urge that it affords at best but a partial explanation of the facts; that 
        it deals with only half, and that the least important half, of the problem. 
        They maintain that the real essence of the problem is to discover the 
        efficient causes of those &quot;variations&quot; which are selected, of those &quot;fittest&quot; 
        modifications of structure which can alone survive; and they believe that 
        the time has come when these great problems may be successfully attacked, 
        and a new light thrown on the inmost recesses of nature's laboratory.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foremost of this school is Dr. E. D. Cope, the 
        well-known anatomist and pal&aelig;ontologist, who in the work now under 
        notice has collected together the various essays, papers, lectures, and 
        addresses by means of which, during the last eighteen years, he has made 
        known his views on evolution in all its bearings. We find here discussions 
        on the relations of animals and plants, on the influence of mind in nature, 
        and on the origin of consciousness, with others on less recondite problems, 
        such as the causes which have brought about the specialized teeth and 
        feet of the various orders of mammalia, and the general evidences for 
        evolution afforded by the vertebrate animals. Some of these questions 
        are discussed at great length, and in several distinct essays from somewhat 
        different points of view, so <font color="990000">[[p. 122]]</font> that 
        it is not always easy to get at the author's exact meaning. We will do 
        our best, however, to give our readers a general idea of Mr. Cope's views 
        upon some of the more interesting questions, pointing out where, in our 
        opinion, his arguments or his conclusions are open to criticism.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the largest and most important chapters 
        is that on the Origin of Genera, which, it is alleged, is a more distinct 
        subject from the origin of species than has been supposed. Throughout 
        the whole essay it is tacitly assumed that generic characters are of a 
        different nature from specific characters, and are always to be distinguished 
        from them, and hence that &quot;genera&quot; are definite realities in nature quite 
        distinct from mere groups of species. This view is directly opposed to 
        the teaching of Darwin and to the experience of systematists, to whom 
        the successive grades of <em>sub-genus</em>, <em>genus</em>, and <em>sub-family</em> 
        are often uncertain and fluctuating; while the idea seems to have arisen 
        from the author's greater familiarity with the skeletons than with the 
        external structures of animals. Mr. Cope further maintains that allied 
        genera differ from each other by single characters only, and that these 
        characters are rarely adaptations to external needs or forces, but are 
        due to laws of acceleration or retardation of growth which act without 
        any reference to fitness at all. In other chapters this acceleration is 
        said to be due to &quot;growth force,&quot; and to be determined in its direction 
        by use and effort.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that this leads to 
        an origin of genera quite distinct from that postulated by Darwin, and 
        which has seemed to most naturalists not only to be simple and probable, 
        but to be a logical result of the theory of development. On the theory 
        of natural selection, new species are produced when any change of conditions 
        requires slight modifications either in color, form, or structure to keep 
        up the harmony between the animal and its environment; or when the struggle 
        for existence is so severe that some individuals of a species are driven 
        to adopt a somewhat different mode of life from their fellows and become 
        modified to suit it--as, for example, when allied terrestrial and arboreal 
        species have acquired differently formed feet. Now, if a species which 
        has thus struck out a new course of life becomes gradually modified into 
        more perfect adaptation to it, and then gives rise to a set of varieties 
        or new species each adapted to some specialized form of that new mode 
        of life, this new group of species constitutes a new genus, and is characterized 
        usually by some structural peculiarity--such as differences in the feet 
        or teeth--which is the special adaptation it has needed and acquired. 
        On this view every new genus has originated in some one modified species 
        of an allied genus.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Cope's view is very different from this. 
        He believes, to use his own words, &quot;that a new genus has been established 
        by the transition of a number of species of a preceding genus, without 
        necessary loss of specific characters&quot;; and he even thinks the same process 
        may have gone on in the transition of a large number of genera into new 
        orders or sub-orders &quot;by the assumption or loss of the character or characters 
        of that to or from which they were transferred, and that without necessary 
        loss of their generic characters.&quot; He believes that this explains the 
        similarity of external form which is often found in corresponding species 
        of distinct genera or distinct families, a similarity which Darwinians 
        explain by the influence of similar conditions affecting growth or coloration.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the difference of principle clear to 
        readers not familiar with minute generic distinctions, we will take an 
        extreme and imaginary case. Let us suppose that the two great families 
        of the wolves and foxes (Canid&aelig;), on the one hand, and the cats 
        (Felid&aelig;), on the other, were much more alike externally than they 
        really are, differing mainly in the important character of the retractile 
        and non-retractile claws and in the habits corresponding to this difference, 
        and that it is required to explain how the Felid&aelig; had been derived 
        from the Canid&aelig;. According to Darwin, some species of fox-like animal 
        had been driven to climb trees in search of food, and every modification 
        giving increased prehensile power to the claws and increased agility had 
        been preserved by natural selection; while subsequently many modifications 
        of this type had been developed to prey upon different kinds of animals, 
        some of the larger ones again becoming adapted to a terrestrial life, 
        and using their agile bodies and retractile claws to capture antelopes, 
        deer, and other swift and wary creatures. But, according to the theory 
        of Mr. Cope, a number of species of primeval Canid&aelig; each acquired 
        independently the characters of retractile claws and agile limbs, and 
        formed the new group Felid&aelig;, which was thus not derived from any 
        one common ancestor, but from a number of distinct species which, through 
        similar causes, had undergone an almost identical structural change. It 
        must be clearly understood that this is only an illustration, since the 
        two families referred to are too remote and too specialized to have been 
        derived directly the one from the other; but the principle is the same 
        as that which would apply to any two distinct but closely allied groups.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the 
        new school is the return to the teaching of Lamarck, that use and effort 
        are the immediate causes of useful variations, and that the individuals 
        which exhibit these are the &quot;fittest&quot; which survive. It is claimed that 
        the &quot;origin of the fittest&quot; can be explained in no other way, and that, 
        until the right variations are produced, no effective selection or useful 
        survival can take place. With regard to the effects of use, Mr. Cope says:</p>

      <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Another reason for believing in use 
        as a cause of structural change is the manner in which the same useful 
        structures have evidently appeared on totally distinct stems, as an evident 
        adaptation to the same circumstances in which different types have been 
        equally placed. Thus the birds of prey possess the hooked, often toothed, 
        beak appropriate for tearing and destroying animals. Their stock is the 
        same as that of the cuckoos and parrots, and even of the pigeons. The 
        butcher-birds are of the division of songsters, not widely removed from 
        the thrushes, and far enough from the raptores, yet the same hook and 
        dentate bill reappears in them, as adapted to flesh-eating habits. Among 
        the reptiles, which were no doubt originally land animals, and derived 
        from batrachians, we have a large number adapted to swimming in the ocean, 
        and these not all of the same stock. Thus the <em>Plesiosauri</em> are 
        crocodilian in relationship, while the <em>Pythonomorpha</em> of America 
        were of the same [stock] that produced the snake and lizard. Again, the 
        same modification appears in the Cetaceans, or whale, etc., among mammals, 
        which are primarily a terrestrial division.&quot; </blockquote>
      </font> 
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all this the Darwinian would probably reply 
        that no causal connection has been shown to exist between the feeding 
        on flesh instead of insects, and the production of a hook or tooth to 
        the bill. The use of the bill seizing larger animals might conceivably 
        strengthen the muscles or even enlarge the bill itself, but could have 
        no such effect as causing the tip of the bill to bend downwards, or a 
        definite portion of the margin to grow out into a tooth. On the other 
        hand, any individual variations in the form of the bill tending towards 
        a hook or a tooth (and just such variations occur now whenever large numbers 
        of specimens are examined) would give a slight advantage in seizing the 
        prey, and would therefore be preserved and accumulated by natural selection. 
        So with the tails of marine animals: the action of swimming might strengthen 
        the muscles of the tail and lead to an increase of its size, but how it 
        should lead to its compression and lateral expansion is by no means clear. 
        Any such change of form would, however, undoubtedly improve it as a swimming 
        instrument, and thus every variation in that direction would be preserved.</p>
   
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An equal want of relation between the supposed 
        cause and the result to be explained exists in the case of the rattle 
        of the rattlesnake, where &quot;the habit of violent vibration&quot; is said to 
        tend &quot;to determine an increased amount of nutritive fluid&quot; to the tail. 
        This might increase the muscular power of the tail by the constant use 
        of special muscles, but something more is required to account for the 
        formation of the horny rattles and modified caudal vertebr&aelig; of the 
        rattlesnake.</p>
         <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use, however, implies some organ or part to 
        be used, the variations in which can be preserved by natural selection, 
        and it is urged with some force that the beginnings of new structures 
        or organs cannot be thus accounted for. For this the doctrine of effort 
        is appealed to, as being a power adequate to direct the &quot;growth-force&quot; 
        in a definite direction, and thus initiate a new organ. The power of imagination 
        or desire acting as a stimulus to the secretions is called in to aid and 
        extend the effects of this principle. As one of the best illustrations 
        of the effects of effort, Mr. Cope refers to the production of horns or 
        shields on the heads of so many animals. Toads are said to protect themselves 
        from attack by presenting the top of the head forward and using it as 
        a shield, and the result is seen in the more highly developed forms possessing 
        more completely ossified crania, while some have projecting angles on 
        the head rarely developed into short horns. The phrynosoma, or horned 
        toad of California and Arizona, is really a sluggish lizard which has 
        developed sharp horns on the back of its head for protection. In the case 
        of the Ruminants, it is remarked that they have the habit of defending 
        themselves by bending down the head with the horns forward, and this habit 
        in the primitive hornless ancestors is supposed to have produced the horns 
        by the combined action of the mental effort directing nutriment to that 
        part, and the surface irritation produced by friction whenever the head 
        was used in combat or defence. In support of this view it is pointed out 
        that the generalized group represented by the hog, which were no doubt 
        the genetic predecessors of the Ruminants, also throw the head down in 
        defence in the same way. It is not, however, explained how it is that 
        in this case tusks and not horns have been developed.</p>
    
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most valuable and suggestive of 
        the applications of the theory of use in modifying structure is presented 
        in the short chapter &quot;On the Origin of the Foot-Structures of the Ungulates.&quot; 
        The remarkable progressive change of a four or five-toed ancestor into 
        the one-toed horse, and the equally remarkable division of the whole group 
        of ungulate animals into the odd-toed and even-toed divisions, are attempted 
        to be explained by the effects of impact and use among animals which frequented 
        hard or swampy ground respectively. On hard ground it is urged that the 
        long middle toe would be most used and subjected to the greatest strains, 
        and would therefore acquire both strength and development. It would then 
        be still more exclusively used, and the extra nourishment required by 
        it would be drawn from the adjacent less-used toes, which would accordingly 
        diminish in size, till, after a long series of changes, the records of 
        which are so well preserved in our American tertiary rocks, the true one 
        toed horse was developed. In soft or swampy ground, on the other hand, 
        the tendency would be to spread out the foot so that there were two toes 
        on each side. The two middle toes would thus be most used and most subject 
        to strains, and would therefore increase at the expense of the lateral 
        toes. There would be, <font color="990000">[[p. 123]]</font> no doubt, 
        an advantage in these two functional toes being of equal size so as to 
        prevent twisting of the foot while walking, and variations tending to 
        bring this about would be advantageous and would therefore be preserved. 
        Thus, by a parallel series of changes in another direction adapted to 
        a distinct set of conditions, we should arrive at the symmetrical divided 
        hoofs of our deer and cattle. The fact that sheep and goats are specially 
        mountain and rock loving animals may be explained by their being a later 
        modification, since the divided hoof once formed is evidently well adapted 
        to secure a firm footing on rugged and precipitous ground, although it 
        could hardly have been first developed in such localities. It will be 
        noted, however, that throughout all this series of changes the influence 
        of natural selection would be required to seize upon and preserve each 
        favorable variation as it occurred.</p>
    
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting chapter is that on &quot;The 
        Evolution of the Vertebrata Progressive and Retrogressive.&quot; Many types 
        in all orders of vertebrates present rudimentary organs, as rudimentary 
        digits, feet, or limbs, rudimental fins, teeth, or wings. There is scarcely 
        an organ or part which is not somewhere in a rudimental and more or less 
        useless condition. These cases may be either persistent primitive conditions 
        to be regarded as ancestral types which have survived to the present time, 
        or, on the other hand, they may be the results of a process of degeneration, 
        and therefore comparatively modern. The former interpretation was once 
        the most generally adopted, but of late years so many proofs of degeneration 
        have been discovered that it is seen to have played a very important part 
        in bringing about the existing forms of animal and plant life. Mr. Cope 
        defines degeneracy as a loss of parts without corresponding development 
        of other parts. In determining the grade of development (or what should 
        be termed advancement) in the organic scale, we have often to strike a 
        balance between degeneration and progression according to the importance 
        of the parts implicated. We regard sensibility as the highest of animal 
        functions, and mind as the highest form of sensibility. Therefore development 
        of organs of sensibility and mind constitutes a better claim of progress 
        than development of stomach or of skin. The ruminating animals are said 
        to be much superior to man in the structure of their feet, teeth, and 
        stomach, yet we assign the higher position to the quadrumana and to man, 
        on account of the superior complication of their brain structure.</p>
    
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest reptiles, the theromorpha, were 
        more nearly allied to mammalia than any now living, so that reptiles as 
        a whole may be said to have degenerated. They have, however, become specialized 
        for certain modes of life, and the whole order of snakes have entirely 
        lost the limbs, so that we have here a process of creation by degeneration 
        on a large scale. Some lizards have also lost either the fore or hind 
        limbs, or in some cases all the limbs, thus resembling snakes in outward 
        form though differing from them altogether in structure. The earliest 
        birds probably possessed a long bony tail as well as teeth, both of which 
        they have lost. The whales and manatees among the mammalia have degenerated 
        by the loss of their posterior limbs and the modification of their fore 
        limbs into swimming paddles. The seals have partially degenerated from 
        the carnivorous type, and the sloths and ant-eaters are supposed to have 
        lost the teeth which their ancestors possessed, and thus to have suffered 
        degeneration.</p>
    
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most curious speculations to be found 
        in this volume is the tracing of plant to animal life through a progressive 
        automatism and loss of consciousness. It is urged that all definite motion 
        in organic beings must have been once conscious motion, and that all automatic 
        or unconscious motions or acts were acquired and organized in states of 
        consciousness. All evidence goes to show that actions sufficiently often 
        repeated become automatic, and it is now believed that all the vital actions 
        of the heart, lungs, stomach, and other organs originated in voluntary 
        motions of some lowly organized ancestor. Mr. Cope thus applies this principle 
        to plants:</p>
     
      <p>&nbsp;
      </p><font size="-1"> 
      <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bearing in mind the property of protoplasm 
        to organize machinery which shall work automatically in the absence of 
        consciousness, we can glance at the succession of vegetable forms. The 
        active movements of the primary stages of the Alg&aelig; are well known. 
        After swimming actively through the water, they settle down, take root, 
        and assume the r&ocirc;le of plants. The <em>Aethalium</em>, swimming 
        with the movements of a Rhizopod, has been known to take food before establishing 
        itself on the damp piles of the tan-bark, where it speedily becomes a 
        low form of fungus. The approximation of the lower forms of plants to 
        animals is notorious. The fungi, it is said, are the only terrestrial 
        plants which live like animals on organic matter, appropriating the humus 
        of their rich nidus in a state of solution. Now, the pal&aelig;ontology 
        of animals has absolutely established the fact that the predecessors of 
        all characteristic or specialized types have been unspecialized or generalized 
        types. It may then be regarded as almost certain that the ancestors of 
        the present higher types of plants were more animal-like than they; that 
        the forms displaying automatic movements were more numerous, and the difficulty 
        of deciding on the vegetable or animal nature of a living organism greater 
        than it is now. Hence it may be concluded that animal consciousness has 
        from time to time organized its machinery and then disappeared for ever, 
        leaving as a result the permanent form of life which we term vegetable. 
        But it is not to be supposed that all changes of structure cease with 
        the departure of consciousness. Given spontaneous movement (<em>i.e.</em>, 
        growth), and surrounding conditions, and the resultant product must be 
        structures adapted to their surroundings, just as the plastic clay be 
        fitted to its mould. And this is essentially the distinguishing character 
        of vegetable teleology as compared with animal. In the average plant we 
        see adaptation to the conditions of unconscious nutrition; in the animal, 
        adaptation to conditions of conscious contact with the world under a great 
        variety of conditions.&quot; </blockquote>
      </font> 
    
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether this remarkable theory of the relations 
        of plant and animal life be ultimately proved to be true or not, it is 
        certainly very suggestive, and opens up before us illimitable vistas of 
        inquiry into the obscure arcana of nature. Many such intellectual gems 
        may be found in the volume under consideration, but they have to be dug 
        out from a mass of unattractive ore. The great fault of the book is that 
        no attempt has been made to systematize and weld together the material 
        of which it is composed. Hence frequent repetitions and self-quotations, 
        with a considerable amount of purely technical matter, quite unreadable 
        by any one but an experienced anatomist. There is ample proof of the author's 
        ability to write a connected work which should set forth his mature views 
        on the great problems of evolution in an attractive as well as an instructive 
        manner; and it is much to be regretted that the somewhat pretentious title 
        here attached to a mere reprint of his collected papers was not reserved 
        for such a work.</p>

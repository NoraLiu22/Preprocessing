<H2>Of molluscs, worms, and lophophores. . .</H2>
</center>
<P>

The Lophotrochozoa comprise one of the major groups within the 
<a href="/phyla/phyla.html">animal kingdom</a>, 
In turn, the Lophotrochozoa belongs to a larger group within the 
Animalia called the <b>Bilateria</b>, because they are bilaterally 
symmetrical with a left and a right side to their bodies.

The cladogram above shows the major groups in the Lophotrochozoa.
Click on any box containing a picture to learn about that particular group.
The phylogeny above is based on a combination of morphology and 18S RNA.
It is not the final word on the relationships between these groups, and
there are many competing hypotheses.  For now, we prefer this grouping
based on the available evidence, but as data continues to accumulate our
picture of the relationships may change.
<P>
The name Lophotrochozoa comes from the names of the two major animal groups 
included: the Lophophorata and the Trochozoa.  In the cladogram above, you 
can see this division.  Those animals to the left side of the cladogram 
are the Lophophorata, while the groups along the top and right side 
(Nemertini through Annelida) belong to the Trochozoa.

<a name="trocho"><b>Trochozoa:</b></a> 
These animals are all <b>protostomes</b> -- the mouth 
develops before the anus in the young embryo -- and they have long been 
recognized as belonging together as a group.  Many of the members are 
worm-like, though not all of them are familiar or common. The two largest 
groups of trochozoans are the <a href="/taxa/inverts/mollusca/mollusca.php">Mollusca</a> 
(molluscs) and the <a href="/annelida/annelida.html">Annelida</a> (segmented 
worms).
<P>
It might seem strange at first to group earthworms and squid together. They 
certainly don't look much alike, but that is only true when looking at the 
<b>adult</b> form; there is a fundamental feature of their life history that 
they share.  Many annelids and molluscs share patterns of development in 
early embryonic stages.  When these larvae hatch, each is a microscopic 
swimmer known as a <b>trochophore larva</b>, shown at right.  The larva has 
two bands of cilia around the middle that are used for swimming and for 
gathering food, and at the "top" is a cluster of longer flagellae.  So the 
larvae of these groups is nearly identical, even though they mature into 
very different adult forms.  Until very recently, the <a href="/arthropoda/arthropoda.html">Arthropoda</a> (insects & crustaceans) 
were considered possible close relatives of the Annelida, based on the 
fact that both groups are segmented, but no arthropod has a trochophore 
larva and no molecular studies support a close relationship.

<b>Lophophorata:</b> This group includes the Phoronida and Entoprocta (both 
small groups) as well as the <a href="/bryozoa/bryozoa.html">Bryozoa</a> 
("moss" animals) and <a href="/brachiopoda/brachiopoda.html">Brachiopoda</a> 
(brachiopods), both of which have an extensive fossil record. The feature 
shared by this group is the <a href="/glossary/gloss7/lophophore.html">lophophore</a>, 
an unusual feeding appendage bearing hollow tentacles. 
<P>
While the Lophophorata are a well-recognized group, phylogenetic studies 
do not yet agree on the identity of their closest relatives.  These animals 
were once included in the <b>Pseudocoelomata</b>, because they do not have 
a distinct internal body cavity like the Trochozoa, but this grouping does 
not hold together in modern studies.  We have placed the Lophophorata in 
the Lophotrochozoa as the most popular of the current choices in the 
literature, but there are studies that suggest they may belong with the 
<a href="/phyla/deuterostomia.html">deuterostomes</a>, or may even be 
<b>paraphyletic</b>.

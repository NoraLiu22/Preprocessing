<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Native American Rugs, Blankets, and Quilts</H1>

The best-known native textile art in North America is the weaving of Navajo Indian blankets and rugs. 
These impressive (and expensive) wool rugs are still made in a style that was traditional in Mexico and the 
southwest United States long before the arrival of Europeans<B>:</b> kneeling before a 
vertical wooden-frame loom and using a shuttle to weave colored threads together into 
large-scale geometric patterns. Originally Navajo and other Southwest Indian blankets were made of 
hand-spun cotton thread, but after the Spanish brought domestic sheep to the region the Navajos 
switched to wool.

Though Navajo blankets and rugs are the most famous weavings in North America, they are 
certainly not the only native weaving tradition. Finger-weaving has been
important throughout the continent since ancient times, and finger-woven 
blankets, tapestries, and clothing are still made in many tribes. The 
chilkat blankets of Tlingit people are one of the finest examples of finger-woven 
Native American blankets. Seminole sashes and patchwork are another important
Indian textile art. A more recent tradition is star quilts or blankets, which 
originated among the Sioux tribes (Lakota, Dakota, and Nakoda/Assiniboine) 
and spread throughout the Great Plains. Quilting was one of many crafting techniques that 
Native Americans borrowed from European traditions and adapted into something unique to their culture. 
Star quilts are made by piecing a mosaic of cloth diamonds into the shape of the traditional eight-pointed 
morning star design of the Sioux. Before the evolution of star quilts, traditional Plains Indian blankets 
were made from painted, quilled and beaded buffalo hide. When the buffalo herds were exterminated this 
craft largely died out, but some Plains tribe artists still make buffalo robes and blankets today
from the hides of animals raised in captivity.
<BR><BR>
If you are looking to buy genuine rugs, quilts, or blankets that were actually made by Native Americans-- either 
because it's important to you to have the real thing or because you want to support native people with your 
purchase--then here is our list of American Indian artists whose native rugs and textiles are available for sale online. If you 
have a website of Native American weaving or quilting to add to this list, 
<A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">let us know</A>. 
We gladly advertise any individual native artist or native-owned rug store here free of charge, provided that 
all rugs and blankets were made by tribally recognized American Indian, Inuit, or First Nations artists.
</p>
Thank you for your interest in Native American art!

<img src="vinesmall.jpg"><font size=5> Chilkat Blankets</font>
</h3>

Chilkat blankets were traditionally woven by the Tlingit Indians out of mountain goat hair and cedar bark.
They were five-sided, deeply fringed and were worn as capes during important ceremonies. The
Chilkat blanket-weaving tradition largely died out a hundred years ago, and the antique ones are costing 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, here are a few contemporary Northwest Coast Indian blanket makers 
whose inspiration is the Chilkat weaving and designs of their people.

Another Native American blanket making tradition that was nearly lost, this time because of the near-extinction of the buffalo.

if you are interested in buying some of the Native Indian rugs featured on this page, please contact the artists directly. 
Though we have featured only American Indian blankets and rugs identified with the name and tribal affiliation of each artist, we haven't

native-owned art business here free of charge. We do <U>not</u> link to rugs which are not made by tribally recognized 
American Indian, Inuit, or First Nations artists. And finally, websites do expire and change hands, so use 
your common sense and this general rule of thumb<B>:</b> if the creator of each individual artwork is not 
identified by name and specific tribe, you are probably not looking at an authentic American Indian rug.

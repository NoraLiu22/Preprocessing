<b><u>Placozoans are tiny amazing animals.</u><br> Very
little is known about them because they have never been 
observed in their natural habitat. No one knows what substrate
they live on or what they eat in nature. It is even unknown 
whether or not they reproduce sexually like most animals. 
They were discovered in the
late 1880's living on the glass walls of an aquarium in a European
laboratory. Since then, most of what has been learned about their biology
has come from studying cultures of them kept alive in various 
laboratories around the world. Not surprisingly, given their small size
and squishy nature, fossil placozoans have yet to be discovered.

<b><u>Placozoan Morphology</u><br> 
Placozoans
are extremely simple animals. Perhaps not coincidentally, they also 
have the smallest amount of DNA ever measured for any type of animal. 
Their bodies are made up of a 
few thousand cells of just four types. You can compare this to
<a href="/porifera/porifera.html">sponges</a>, which have anywhere from 10
to 20 different kinds of cells, to <a href="/arthropoda/uniramia/diptera.html">flies</a>, which
have roughly 90 different cell types, and to you and other 
<a href="/mammal/mammal.html">mammals</a>, which
have over 200 different types of cells. Placozoans are transparent, flat, 
round (up to 3 millimeters across), and have two distinct sides.
A tissue layer composed of two types of cells, column-shaped <u>cylinder cells</u> 
with cilia and <u>gland cells</u> without cilia, make up the ventral (or bottom) surface.
The upper dorsal surface consists of a layer of just <u>cover cells</u>, which are 
ciliated and flattened toward the outside of the animal. 
The image above shows the dorsal surface of a small specimen 
(just over 4/10ths of a millimeter in diameter) seen from above
through a microscope. The dorsal and ventral tissues appear
to correspond to ectoderm and endoderm, the outer and inner tissue
layers of most animals, but it is not yet known which is endoderm
and which is ectoderm. The fourth type of placozoan cells are called 
<u>fiber cells</u>. These cells are star-shaped and reside in
the space between the two tissue layers. The star shape results from
thin extensions of the cells which connect to each other in a network. Cellular
material such as microtubules and microfilaments traverse the extensions from
fiber cell to fiber cell. It is hypothesized that this system of connected
cells in important in coordinating the movement of placozoans. Placozoans 
can move in two ways, by gliding on their cilia and by changing their shape 
like an amoeba.
<P>
<u>Placozoan Feeding and Reproduction</u><br>
In the laboratory, placozoans 
have been kept alive by feeding them the flagellated
<a href="/chromista/chromista.html">chromist</a> <i>Cryptomonas</i> or
the <a href="/greenalgae/greenalgae.html">chlorophyte</a> <i>Chlorella</i>. 
It is unknown what placozoans feed on in nature; they may feed
on a number of different organisms. A placozoan feeds with its ventral surface,
which produces digestive enzymes. Often, individuals contract part of the 
ventral surface into a sac where digestion may take place more efficiently.
Placozoans can reproduce asexually by either binary fission or, less often,
by budding. Some laboratory observations suggest that sexual reproduction
may occur. When the population density becomes high, placozoans start to 
degenerate. Usually a single egg or oocyte develops in the interspace of 
a degenerating placozoan. Small cells (without flagella) that also form when
placozoans degenerate are inferred to be sperm cells. After fertilization, which
does not appear to have been documented, cleavage begins. Development has only been
observed to the 64 cell stage, at which point the cells cease to separate while the
nuclear DNA continues to multiply until the nucleus bursts. Placozoan reproduction
and development will probably not be fully understood until they are observed
in their natural habitat.
<P>
<u>The Phylogenetic Position of Placozoa</u><br> 
Some scientists have inferred that placozoans might be the earliest branch 
of animals (as shown in box A below) because they are so simple. However, 
the discovery that placozoan epithelial cells are connected by junctions of
extracellular proteins (belt desmosomes), a condition present in all
animals other than <a href="/porifera/porifera.html">sponges</a>, 
suggested that placozoans may have diverged later in the history of animals
(box B below). 
<img src="Phylo_Alternatives.GIF" ALT="Alternative Hypotheses for the Phylogenetic 
Position of Placozoa" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=145 ALIGN=center>
<br>More recently, data from molecular sequences (18S)
have indicated that placozoans might have diverged even later in the history
of animals (box C above). If this latter view were true, it would imply that placozoans
are secondarily simplified from more complex ancestors that had a nervous 
system. Interestingly enough, placozoans contain cells, which are 
dispersed around their outer edge, that react with
antibodies against a neuropeptide that is present in the nervous system
of cnidarians. In any event, the alternative hypotheses for the phylogenetic 
position of Placozoa within the animals need further testing with additional 
data.
<P>
<u>Placozoan Diversity</u><br>
Just two species of placozoans have ever been described, <i>Trichoplax
adhaerens</i> and <i>Treptoplax reptans</i>. The latter of these has 
never been seen since its description in 1896, causing some to doubt its
existence. The former, however, has been reported from many tropical and
subtropical locations around the world, including: the Bermudas, the 
Caribbean Sea, Eastern Australia, the Great Barrier Reef, Guam, Hawaii, 
Japan, the Mediterranean Sea, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Red Sea, Vietnam,
and Western Samoa. This prompts the question of whether <i>Tricoplax
adhaerens</i> is really a single species. Furthermore, placozoans are 
so cryptic that their diversity might be much greater than we realize.

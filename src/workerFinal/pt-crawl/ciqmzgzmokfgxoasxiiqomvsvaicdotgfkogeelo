morbus or any other pestilentialepidemic.<p>As for the plague's entering by way of our seaports, I find little probabilityof such an occurrence, particularly in the Atlantic ports, where sanitarymeasures have been so carefully observed that it would seem to me quitedifficult for the disease to infiltrate our borders.&nbsp; And in any event,the disease would quickly be confined to the ports and treated with suchsuccess by rational medicine, known to all French physicians, that thereneed be no fear of its spreading to the interior.<p>Throughout France, the felicitous application that has been made sincethe Revolution of 1789 of rules of hygiene and health measures has redoundedto the benefit of the country's inhabitants....&nbsp;<p>By contrast, recall that, so far as we know, the disease has proveddevastating only in fetid, marshy areas in certain parts of Asia Minor,Russia, and Poland....<p>Today in no other country of the globe have civilization, industry,and commerce achieved a higher degree of perfection [than in France] andin no country but England are the rules of hygiene more faithfully observed.&nbsp;Cleanliness and above all sobriety, prophylactics against every sort ofdisease, are the leading traits of the French Citizenry...<p>Enlightenment has spread so widely through all classes of society thateveryone is well aware of the precautions to be taken against the causesof disease:&nbsp; We are blessed with a superb and healthy population....<p>What country, moreover, is richer than ours in enlightened physicianswho contribute so powerfully to the maintenance of public health?<blockquote>--Dominique Jean de Larrey (1831)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surgeon and inspector of the army health service</blockquote><center>______________<p><b>1832</b></center><p>Should poisoning, pestilence, and death be the watchwords of the governmentof France, the world's premier nation?<p>...The admirable people of Paris, who are so heroically confrontingthe cholera of poverty, which in eighteen months has tripled the deathrolls--the people of Paris were not made to serve as fodder for the choleraof Asia and to die like slaves in pain and terror.<p>There is one true protection against cholera; it is to remain, in thepresence of this new and ubiquitous enemy, courageous and invincible.<p>There is ... an important lesson to be learned in the midst of publiccalamity:&nbsp; namely, that man is in part the author of his own destiny.&nbsp;For in the external world man may not always be master, capable of preventingnature from encroaching in ways often destructive to his own work; buthe is almost always capable of stopping, and energetically repelling, theseinvasions of evil, by means of a moral reaction that stems from within....<p>Paris--that center of civilization and progress, a city where such vastresources are sacrificed on the altar of public welfare--should have demonstratedthe power of the social state by triumphing over the most terrible scourgeto afflict the human race.<p>Instead, Paris has succumbed to this new invasion; the disease has provedmore lethal here than elsewhere; and no quarter of this great city is nowadaysso populous as its cemeteries.<p><b>What good, then, are all its hospitals, its doctors, its science,and its public administration?&nbsp; Are all the resources of civilizationworthless?&nbsp; Is civilization incapable of compensating mankind forall the harm it has done through its laws, its institutions, its errors,and its injustices?</b><p>No:&nbsp; the blame should not be laid at the door of the social stateitself.&nbsp; Instead, the finger of accusation should point at those whoexploit the state and corrupt it, at those who see civilization merelyas a more sophisticated servant of their luxury and pleasure, at thosewho view a great city as a factory in which all hands labor for their benefitand all space is arranged for their convenience.<p>The city is a city of palaces and hovels:&nbsp; a few splendid quarterswith colonnades and huge gardens closed to the man in work clothes and,in the center of this sumptuous enclosure, a sewer of narrow streets anddark, unhealthy buildings, as dank as dungeons, where those who toil cometo catch their breath in fetid air....<p>So, an epidemic arrives, preceded by cries of terror from two continents,and finds its prey ready-made, its victims huddled together and weak.&nbsp;It opens its charnel house in the artisans' district, whereupon the philanthrophistssay that the public should take heart, for the scourge seems willing toclaim as its victims only the ill-clad, ill-housed, and ill-fed, whichis to say, the working people of Paris.<blockquote>--Michel Chevalier (1832)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; economist and liberal theorist</blockquote></td></tr><tr>  <td bgcolor="#339999"><div

CHOLERA</u></b></center><p>EXPERIENCE having proved that "CHOLERA" is not contagious, let no onefear to render assistance to his Neighbour, or any Fellow-Creature whomay be attacked with it.<p>Keep the mind at rest, trusting in God, and "fear not the Pestilencethough it walk in darkness, nor the Destruction that wasteth at noon-day."<p>"CHOLERA" in its early stages is easily curable.&nbsp; When more advanced,is not only difficult to cure but almost defying the power of Medicine.<p>Preventive measures and prompt attention to the earliest symptoms arechiefly to be relied upon.<p>The Causes predisposing to "CHOLERA," and therefore to be avoided asmuch as possible, are--want of Cleanliness of Person,--Intemperance in theuse of Spirits--of fermented Liquors--or of Tobacco,--Debauchery, or excessof any kind,--Irregular Habits,--excessive Fatigue,--Sitting in wet Clothes,--orindeed exposure either to wet--cold--damp--or sudden Chills.<p>The great preventive of "CHOLERA," is--Pure Air and Cleanliness.&nbsp;Every House ought therefore to be kept perfectly clean and thoroughly ventilated.&nbsp;Lime-washing is particularly recommended, and persons whose Work is outof doors should wear a flannel belt round the body, next to the skin.<p>The symptoms of "CHOLERA," which should act as a warning, are--Loosenessof the Bowels or Diarrhoea--Nausea or Sickness--in which stage it is easilycurable or preventible.&nbsp; If neglected, the Blue Stage or "ASIATICCHOLERA" comes on, in which little help is derivable from Medicine.<p>Let none therefore neglect the slightest signs of Looseness or Diarrhoea,or any other irregularity in the system, as there is a tendency, duringthe prevalence of "CHOLERA," for all Diseases to merge into this Complaint.<p>The Guardians are prepared to issue "CERTIFICATES" to the Poor generally,entitling them to Medical Relief gratuitously, should "CHOLERA" break out,or its symptoms prevail in the Neighbourhood.&nbsp; They recommend suchpersons as cannot afford to pay for Medical attendance to apply forthwithto the Relieving Officer, who will lay the application before the Board.&nbsp;It is important for the Poor to be put in possession of these "CERTIFICATES"before they are actually required.<blockquote><blockquote>By order of the Board,<br>S.

In 1892, it was a self-governingcity-state embedded in the Reich of the new kaiser, Wilhelm II, and oneof the principal points of departure for millions of Europeans on theirway to new lives in the New World.<p>Hamburg provided few public services to its citizens,relying instead on private investors to supply what was needed and peoplewere willing to purchase.&nbsp; Hamburg's water came directly from theElbe River.&nbsp; By that time, water filtration was recognized as an effectivedeterrent to the spread of cholera.&nbsp; Reich-ruled cities like Berlinhad long since taken steps to make filtered water available to their residents.&nbsp;Even Altona, a small town immediately downstream from Hamburg, and whichalso took its water from the Elbe, had its own public filtered water system.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the high cost of installing and maintaining such a systemhad delayed Hamburg's plans for twenty years.</td>  </tr></table><p align="center"><img src="hamburgaltona1865acb.jpg" width="594" height="362" border="3"><p><table width="600" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">  <tr>    <td bgcolor="#99CCCC">In August 1892, a trainload of hopefulemigr&eacute;s arrived in Hamburg.&nbsp;

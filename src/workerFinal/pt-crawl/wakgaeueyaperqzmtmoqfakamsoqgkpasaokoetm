<blockquote><blockquote>
<font size="+2">S</font>travinsky is one of the most original creative musicians of the 20th
century. In a career spanning six decades, he composed a glittering
sequence of works of astonishing diversity, from the three, vividly
colorful early Russian ballets, through the sharp wit and purity of
his `neo-classical' scores and the powerful spirituality of works like
the <cite>Symphony of Psalms</cite> and the <cite>Mass,</cite> to the
highly individual application of serialism in the late works.

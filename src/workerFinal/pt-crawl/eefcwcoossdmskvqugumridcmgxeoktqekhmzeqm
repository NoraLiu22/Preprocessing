/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The World Wide Web is a marvelous resource, 
          but it also has some drawbacks. One is that it has the tendency to promote 
          the rapid spread of misinformation. All one has to do is to put up some 
          sloppily researched and/or incorrect data, and this will be picked up 
          on by other persons who have no reason to believe otherwise, and who 
          don't have the time or inclination to check their facts. Certain bits 
          of misinformation about Wallace are currently being circulated in this 
          fashion, and one fears that the inaccuracies will continue to spread 
          unless somebody makes some effort to stem the tide. The following represent 
          some of the more common errors regarding Wallace's life and work that 
          are now blindly plying the electronic seas (see also my <a href="http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/essays/ITSONWEB.htm">&quot;It's 
          On The Web...&quot;--Or, When is a &quot;Russel&quot; a &quot;Russel&quot;?</a>):</font></strong></p>

      <ul><br />
		  
		  <li>It has been reported a number of times that Wallace originated the term 'indefinite departure,' I find no evidence that he ever used this wording--despite the appearance of the phrase 'depart indefinitely' in the title of the Ternate essay of 1858.</li>
      </ul><ul>
        <li>Sometimes one sees it remarked in the literature that Wallace coined the term &quot;Darwinism.&quot; He did not, actually; 
            the word entered into general usage very soon after Darwin's <em>Origin</em> 
          appeared in 1859, apparently as a natural reaction from many sources. 
          Wallace did, however, give the term a final endorsement when he used 
          it as the title of his book <em>Darwinism</em> (S724) in 1889.</li>
      </ul><ul>
        <li><p>Contrary to a number of sources, Wallace's 1858 essay 
          on natural selection was not sent to Darwin with the expressed goal 
          of having it published. Both Darwin and Wallace later indicated that 
          the accompanying cover letter said nothing about publication.</p></li>
      </ul>

<ul><li>
          <p>Although I realize that doing so will undoubtedly 
            annoy my Welsh readers, I feel I must protest at the increasing number 
            of sources that refer to Wallace as being &quot;Welsh&quot; instead 
            of &quot;English.&quot; With all due allowances for various past disrespects 
            that have been committed concerning the Welsh people, I feel it is 
            only fair in this instance that Wallace be referred to for general 
            purposes as an Englishman. My reasons for this are set out in some 
            detail in <a href="FAQ.htm#Welsh">one of the items in the &quot;FAQ&quot; 
            section</a>.</p>
        </li></ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            
          <p>In many sources one sees the inference that Wallace's 
            1855 &quot;Sarawak Law&quot; essay (<a href="bib1.htm#zS020">S20</a>) 
            represented a stating of the theory of natural selection predating 
            his and Darwin's 1858 publication. This is absolutely incorrect, for 
            the simple reason that the 1855 work, while all but coming out in 
            favor of the idea of organic <i>evolution</i>, contains not a word 
            even hinting at the notion of natural selection. Instead, it discusses 
            the geological/geographical pattern of species divergence, with Wallace 
            referring to such divergences as &quot;creations,&quot; an indication 
            that he had no grasp of the generating process, just its results.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>One all too frequently sees Wallace's name spelled 
            out as: &quot;Alfred Russell Wallace.&quot; This is incorrect! His second name 
            is spelled with only one &quot;l&quot;: <em>Russel</em>! </p>
        </li>
        <li>Wallace is sometimes judged as becoming a spiritualist 
          so he could reach out to his dead son--but this is in error because 
          his son actually died several years after Wallace's acceptance of spiritualism 
          in the mid and late 1860s.</li>
      </ul
>
        <ul>
          <li>
            
          <p>Wallace's expedition to the Malay Archipelago was 
            <i>not</i> supported by Royal Geographical Society (or any other group) 
            funds, though he <i>was</i> able to secure a grant from that institution 
            covering the expense of his passage to Singapore in 1862, and he did 
            benefit from letters of introduction and the like prepared for him 
            by representatives of the British and Dutch governments.</p>
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li> 
            <p>Wallace's historical contribution to the study 
              of the Martian surface has been somewhat exaggerated by some sources. 
              While it is noteworthy that he was a pioneer in the application 
              of sound scientific reasoning methods to the assessment of Martian 
              geographical and climatological conditions (in a successful effort 
              to counter the claims of Percival Lowell and others regarding the 
              Martian &quot;canals&quot;), he did not, on the one hand, suggest that Martian 
              surface craters had been created by meteor impacts, nor on the other 
              suggest that the &quot;canals&quot; had resulted from surface erosion by water 
              (his theory invoked a combination of surface shrinkage and volcanism).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Wallace was never knighted or similarly honored. 
              Thus, one should never refer to him as &quot;Sir Alfred,&quot; &quot;Lord 
              Alfred,&quot; or the like.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Henry Walter Bates, the naturalist who accompanied 
              Wallace to South America in 1848, was <em>not</em> in any larger 
              scale sense Wallace's mentor or teacher (though he did originally 
              introduce Wallace to the joys of natural history collecting). In 
              fact, he was two years <em>younger</em> than Wallace. Neither was 
              Bates a teacher at the Leicester school where Wallace was working 
              when they met, as some sources have reported. Further, it was by 
              all accounts Wallace, not Bates, who had the idea of undertaking 
              an expedition to South America.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Thomas Vere Wallace, Wallace's father, did <em>not</em> 
              die when Wallace was a child. In Wallace's autobiography <em>My 
              Life</em> (S729) he specifically states that the family moved &quot;to 
              Hoddesdon in 1837 or 1838, where my father died in 1843.&quot; Thus he 
              was nineteen or twenty when his father died.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Wallace was not &quot;lower class&quot;; in fact, his parents 
              came from quite upstanding stock: his father had been trained and 
              sworn in as a lawyer (but because of inherited wealth did not practice), 
              and had reputedly hung around with leisure-seekers (and met Beau 
              Brummel) when he was younger; another paternal-side relative who 
              died in 1803 had been an Admiral and was knighted. On his mother's 
              side some of his relatives had held prominent positions such as 
              architect and town mayor. Of course the family did fall on hard 
              times <em>financially</em>, but that is another matter.</p>

          <li>
            <p>After Wallace returned to England from the Amazon, 
              he did not immediately set out for the Malay Archipelago; indeed, 
              it was only after a full eighteen month stay that he took off again.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The famous papers on natural selection were delivered 
              in July 1858 at a meeting of the Linnean Society, not the Royal 
              Society.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Wallace was not a spiritualist in his &quot;later years&quot; 
              only. He first publicly supported study of the belief in 1866 (and 
              was certainly a full convert by 1869); thus, he lived as much of 
              his life as a spiritualist, as not.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Wallace did not abandon natural selection in his 
              later years. He aggressively defended the theory in print right 
              up through his final year of life at the age of ninety.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Wallace did not coin the phrase &quot;survival of the 
              fittest&quot;--Herbert Spencer did. It <em>was</em> Wallace, however, 
              who suggested that Darwin use the phrase as a means of conveying 
              the basic idea of natural selection to nonspecialist readers.</p>

Lepenski Vir is a Mesolithic site - that means middle stone age, in this case 8 000 years before the present, after the ice had begun to melt from the glaciers which covered so much of the Northern Hemisphere. It is an open air site, not a rock shelter. It is noted for the trapezoidal houses which had one of the first types of concrete as their foundations. They inhabitants ate fish, aurochs, deer and water birds. Professor Dragoslav Srejović excavated the site of Lepenski Vir.The prehistoric settlement was built on the sunny right bank of the Danube, between the steep slopes of the Koršo hills and the spring high water mark on the low porphyritic rocks which stretch down to the river."><META Name="keywords" Content="Lepenski Vir,  whirlpool, Djerdap, Iron Gates, Gorge, Koršo, Korso, Mesolithic,  stone age, ice, open air,  rock shelter, trapezoidal, houses, concrete, fish, aurochs, deer, water, birds, Srejović, Srejovic, excavated, prehistoric, settlement, Danube, Donau"><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><meta http-equiv="window-target" content="_top" ><meta name="robots" content="index, follow"> </HEAD><BODY><br><br><center><h2><b><A HREF ="changes.html">Recent additions, changes and updates to Don's Maps</A></b></h2></center><center><br /><!-- CSS file for site and menu --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/layout.css" /><link rel="icon" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon" href="https://www.donsmaps.com/favicon.ico"></center><center><script type="text/javascript"><!--//--></script></center><!-- Menu down Left Hand Side --><div class="left_menu">Navigation<ul ><li><a class="normal" href="abeltasmantrack.html">Abel Tasman Track in New Zealand</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="kimberleyart.html">Aboriginal Art of the Kimberleys</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginalrockart.html">Aboriginal art on the Northern Tablelands of NSW</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginals.html">Aborigines of Australia</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="pataudtools.html">Abri Pataud Tools</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="raymonden.html">Abri de Raymonden</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="mihisalisburyaccess.html">Access to Mihi Gorge and to Salisbury Waters below the junction with  Mihi Creek </a></li><li><a class="normal" href="loess.html">Achenheim -

The pressure of the ice weakened the cliff-like banks in many places, and when the spring thaws came, huge chunks fell into the stream. One of these left a broad fresh gash on the Yugoslav side of the stream, overlooking the great whirlpool known as Lepenski Vir. Some local peasants, making their way over a goat path along the cliffs, noticed something odd about the gash: several yards below their feet there was a ledge with what looked like layers of cement floors sticking out. They reported this strange sight to the authorities.But wily peasants are always reporting strange sights of this sort since they have heard that there is money to be made in finding prehistoric objects. Besides, a world war was underway just over Yugoslavia's borders, and the authorities had more important things to think about. The peasants' report was filed away in a drawer in a Ministry in Belgrade. Shortly thereafter Belgrade was bombed by the Germans, and the Ministry disappeared along with the rest of the Yugoslavian government. Grass and brush quickly reclaimed the gash in the river-bank, and one of the great archaeological discoveries of our time was delayed by a quarter of a century.In 1965 Dragoslav Srejovi, who had been six years old in 1940, was a bright young assistant professor of archeology at the University of Belgrade. The Yugoslavian and Romanian governments, each looking for independence in matters of energy, had just signed an agreement to build a giant hydroelectric dam which would back water up for more than 30 miles and turn the Iron Gates area into a quiet lake. Lepenski Vir, about half way up the gorge, was one of the sites he visited to determined whether there were any ancient remains that would justify a digging expedition before the waters rose.There seemed nothing unusual about the ledge when he first came to it Through the thick underbrush, he could detect remains of a Roman road and watch-tower, and fragments of pottery made by a Neolithic people who had spread over the Danubian basin in the fifth millennium B. C. Such finds are common in this part of the world. The site was very cramped, measuring barely 550 by 160 feet: it was unlikely that anyone would have chosen to build anything interesting or important there.Still, he found something odd and challenging about the spot. When the fog settled down on the multicolored water of the Danube as it churned up ore-bearing muds from its bottom, Srejovi had the impression of being on another planet, at least on another continent. Botanical specialists would soon point out to him that the vegetation at Lepenski Vir is indeed quite different from that growing on ledges and in gorges only a few miles away. Located on a north-south loop of an east-west gorge, this is a site that is sheltered from all destructive winds: the cold ones from the Russian steppes as well as the searing sirocco from Africa. Snow rarely falls here. As a result it is what botanists call a refuge area, where plants could survive when they were being killed off by global cooling elsewhere in northern Europe thousands of years ago and can now be found only on the shores of the Mediterranean.Srejovi decided to dig. That summer, on a shoe-string budget, with a workforce of two students and ten pick-and-shovel laborers, he began scooping up and examining the earth.Just beneath the surface, he found what he had expected: traces of Roman military occupation, and below that objects that could be identified as belonging to the Starevo culture, a primitive people believed to have been the first in the Danube valley to have scratched the ground to plant a little wheat and barley, and to have begun the domestication of wild cattle and goats.The Starevo period stands at the dawn of the Neolithic or New Stone Age in this part of the world (roughly, the first half of the fifth millennium BC). Anything beneath it therefore belongs to the Mesolithic of Middle Stone Age, generally regarded as the dark ages of prehistory. It was a period which in Europe extended for about three millennia between 8000 and 5000 B.C. Global cooling had produced a harsh climate, game was elusive, and mankind was reduced to a few bands of nomadic hunters living a precarious life, stumbling through snow and ice and rock for a chance to get a few mouthfuls of food, passing their nights in caves or in holes in the ground. The marvelous skills of the their ancestors, the Paleolithic hunters who had not only plenty to eat but also the leisure time to make the marvelous cave paintings of caves like Lascaux and Altamira, were forgotten. Srejovi himself had excavated Mesolithic sites in southern Yugoslavia, and they all bore witness to a low brutish form of existence. The people's health was bad, their bones showed every symptom of malnutrition and exposure: rickets, rheumatism, rotten teeth. They were stunted in build, and they rarely lived beyond the age of 30.Imagine the astonishment of Srejovi and his crew when they found they had dug down to a flat surface which looked very much like cement, and which even turned out to be like cement, the very floors that had caught the eyes of the peasants 25 years before. They were made of an amalgam of local limestone with sand and water, a level of technological achievement that would have been thought surprising in people living hundreds or even thousands of years later. And the slabs of this cement were not laid down haphazardly; they were measured out carefully to form the foundations of houses, with upright slabs around them, some of them arranged so that they could support slanting poles. Presumably these poles were covered with animal hides, and the whole structure was a flat-topped tent which could shelter a family of about five people.There were several dozen such foundations, some built one over the other, houses that had been built and rebuilt as circumstances demanded. But at every layer there was a striking uniformity. There was always a house, or two houses, bigger than the others and in a central position, presumably indicating some position of importance within the community. All the houses faced in the same direction, their wider ends toward the river, all were built in the same shape: a trapezoid with one rounded end (more exactly, a section of a circle with an outward angle of 60 degrees) with fixed proportions of 3:1 or 4:1 between its length and each of its sides.In each house the same trapezoidal shape is repeated in the hearths surrounded by vertical slabs, always in the eastern or sunny end of the house, in the exact center of an equilateral triangle which Srejovi believes was the module on which all construction at Lepenski Vir was based. .There had been nothing anything like this is previous human history, or at. least in any human history that has been unearthed to this date.The same sense of precision and order found in the construction of the houses is found also in their arrangement on the site. Prehistoric settlements are characteristically haphazard, the dwellings huddled together or scattered at random about the available space. Rational town planning, in the form of straight streets dividing city blocks, does not appear before the Greeks, a scant 2,500 years ago, But here, 5,000 and more years before the Greeks, in this wilderness village, all the houses are neatly arranged in a fan-shaped pattern opening out from the river-bank. There was always an empty space, labeled "marketplace" by Srejovi, in front of the bigger houses. And between all the houses narrow alleys ran in straight lines either to the marketplace or to the river's edge.There were 20 archaeologists working on the project by now, and 70 laborers, provided by the government with a barracks that had been used by border guards. Behind every hearth in the houses they found a flat stone with a cuplike depression in it  - presumably some kind of altar. Behind the altar were generally two or ore upright stones, at first assumed to be natural boulders picked up off the riverbank. Investigation then revealed that they were all of a reddish sandstone which appeared to have come from a ravine a couple of miles away. Some of these stones were indeed natural boulders, but others were found to have decorations, wavy lines or chevrons, chipped into them in low relief. Were these lines stylized representations of hair, snakes, fish scales, or were they mystical abstractions, or mere doodling?While the argument raged during the third summer of excavation, a new and more startling discovery was made. An upright stone, of the familiar red sandstone, turned up in the largest house yet uncovered. It was almost two feet tall. A burly workman carried it down to the river to wash off some of the incrustations of the ages, and then Srejovi began to scrape away the mud still clinging to the surface. All at once his chief assistant, Letica Zega, let out a screech. "It's a face!"No one believed her at first. Every one knew that monumental sculpture entered human history in the Near East two or more millennia after the settlement at Lepenski Vir had ceased to exist. Old Stone Age men had made little figurines of clay or stone and scratched designs on bones and rocks, but no one had ever dreamed of their making life-size statues. Nevertheless, as Srejovi scraped away, more and more features stood out, and every one had to admit that he was holding in his hand a sculptured head.A human head, but a strange one. Srejovi at first thought it was a fish, and it did have oddly fishlike features. Like the 20 or os very similar works which would later be found on the site, it was goggle-eyed, gape-mouthed, very fishy. But it had a nose, the eyes were in the front of the head and not on the sides, and there was a suggestion of shoulders and arms, a bust, below the head. It was undoubtedly human.Perhaps these statues represented gods, perhaps ancestral figures guarding the hearth. Whatever they were, they were, so far as any one can tell today, the first pieces of monumental sculpture ever made on earth. Their only rivals would be some heads found far off at Jericho in Palestine, of roughly the same epoch. But these were not carved out of stone, they were human skulls filled with clay and coated with white plaster. It was apparently here at Lepenski Vir, on this lost ledge, that some unknown genius first got the idea of hacking or chipping life-size, or more-than-life-size, effigies out of solid rockCarbon-dating of charcoal found in the hearths covers a span of several hundred years in the sixth millennium and perhaps the beginning of the fifth. But there are no charcoal samples from the earliest layers, so there is no certain way of knowing how far back the origins of the settlement may go. All that can be said for certain is that the community must have held together for an immensely long time to be able to develop and the cultural resources that would make such statues possible.Sir Mortimer Wheeler, the dean of British archaeologists, says of these achievements that they make Lepenski Vir one of the few sites in the world to which the epithet "unique" can be legitimately applied. Its sculpture, he says, "enters world history substantially in his own right and without convincing parentage.".It is, in short, an original invention, by people of whom we can never learn the name.Analysis of fossilized pollen on the site shows that the climate at Lepenski Vir was colder then that it is today. Birches grew where oak and elm now cover the mountainsides. But in general the landscape must have looked much the same as it did to Srejovi on his first visit. Only it would not have seemed so tight, enclosed, foreboding to those early inhabitants as it did to him. It must have looked more like a Shangri-La, an Eden before the Fall, a place of peace and plenty and joy and rest. Instead of passing their whole lives, like their ancestors, scurrying after enough food to keep them barely alive, they could now let the food come to them as they lolled about in comfort.. There were edible berries and tubers growing along the bank, and the game animals which swarmed on the mountains could be casually knocked on the head when they came down to eat the berries. The seeds of blackberry and wild plum and wild cherry, the bones of martens, beavers, deer, wild boars and aurochs which have been found in the hearths of their houses, showed that all these source of supply were plentiful, And there was a still more plentiful inexhaustible supply waiting only a hundred yards or so out in the river. There they could see, perpetually churning, the greatest whirlpool in all the turbulent course of the Danube through the Iron Gates. The Danube was unpolluted then, and it swarmed with every shape and size of fish. Little fish had to give the whirlpool a wide berth or they would be swept to their death on the rocks, but big fish like sturgeon and salmon had only to position themselves firmly at the edge of the whirl and open their mouths and the river would sweep up a constant supply of nutrients from its bed to thrust down their throats, and they could lazily grow to monstrous size. As for the inhabitants of the village, all they had to do was to paddle out on a treetrunk or a rude raft, brain a couple of fish with a club and come back with enough ingredients for a long round of feasts.Fish were thus the guarantee of prosperity for Lepenski Vir; and it is no wonder the statues of their gods (assuming that they were gods) had fishlike features. Even when the climate turned milder, and they were able to replace fish with game as their staple food, they went on putting fish-faced statues by their hearths.Once the inhabitants had settled in, time seems to have stood still in Lepenski Vir. Study of the bones found there shows that there was no admixture of foreign population; the same people remained on the spot, intermarrying generation after generation, perhaps 120 generations in all - well over 2,500 years. During all that time they remained healthy. (Did they, like the ancient Greeks, toss aside the infants that did not live up to their sturdy standards?) There are no deformed or diseased bones here, and the women were so robust that it is hard to tell their skeletons from those of the men. They lived long, often into their eighties.There were never many of them. The narrow ledge could never have had room for more than 20 or 25 houses at a time, each of which could hardly have held more than five adults. This would hardly be called a village in most countries today, but in Megalithic terms it was enormous, it represented a whole new dimension of human life. And though the community was so self-sufficient that it never had to import any merchandise, it apparently exported some of its conceptions. For at about a dozen locations on both banks of the river within a radius of some 20 miles, archaeologists have found remains of Mesolithic villages which look like crude copies of Lepenski Vir. They were smaller, the buildings were less solid, they had no carved stones or statues. But their houses and their hearths are trapezoidal in shape. Srejovi considers that Lepenski Vir must have been a kind of cultural metropolis, a mini-Rome to which outlying groups owed at least spiritual obedience.Then one day the inhabitants went away from Lepenski Vir forever. There is no sign of a violent end, no fire or rockslide; the settlement was simply abandoned. While we can do more than guess, it is tempting to guess that the end came about as it did in the Garden of Eden, because of progress, an increase in knowledge. Some time in the fifth millennium BC, the "Neolithic Revolution" came to the Danube basin. Humans learned to grow crops and domesticate cattle, opening immense horizons for humanity but dooming Lepenski Vir, which simply lacked the room for either agriculture or pasture on a successful scale.And so after a time span that only Egypt and China can compare with in the more recent world, this tight little culture faded away.And the physical remains might have disappeared too, with water rising behind the giant dam and lapping over the ledge, if Srejovi had not persuaded the government to provide the funds to hoist all the surviving floors and stones 60 feet up to another ledge, oriented like the original one to the rising sun, And there they sit to this day, waiting for the government to build a road for the army of tourists who should be tramping to see these relics of a lost Eden.©1975 Robert Wernick   -->Lepenski Vir is the name of the great whirlpool in the middle of Djerdap and the nearby horseshoe-shaped shelf between the right bank of the Danube and the steep cliffs of the Kor&#353;o hills. A group of experts from the Belgrade Archaeological Institute who visited this spot for the first time in late summer 1960 noticed on the bank, in shallow cross-section, an indeterminate layer containing fragments of pottery belonging to the Star&#269;evo group, the oldest culture of the Late Stone Age (Neolithic) in the Danube Basin. It was concluded from the area available for habitation, and the simple culture layer which appeared to contain nothing of interest, that the Neolithic settlement at Lepenski Vir was not of any great extent, had existed for only a short while and was very poor.<br /><br />The impression gained by the author when he visited Lepenski Vir in August 1965 was even less encouraging. The Danube floods had carried away almost the whole levelled area of the shelf, and the stratigraphy was still more indeterminate. It was noticed that the foundations of a Roman guard-tower had partially disturbed the layers to a considerable depth, and stone weapons and numerous sherds scattered thickly on the bank showed that the central part of the settlement had been completely destroyed. When excavation was begun, therefore, it was in the belief that the site represented the extreme periphery of a Neolithic settlement of minor importance which, furthermore, was at a considerable distance from the great centres of the Star&#269;evo culture in the Pannonian Plain and the Morava Basin.<br /><br />As important results were not expected, the scale of operations was modest; in August 1965 only two trial-trenches were opened, investigations being limited to an area of fifty-one square metres. The outcome was truly astonishing - beneath the layers visible in cross-section, which contained the remains of a settlement from early Neolithic times, a hitherto unknown culture of the greatest archaeological significance came to light. Its basic features, however, were only gradually revealed: in 1966 the greater part of the settlement was excavated, including imposing architectural remains; in 1967 several monumental stone sculptures were found, and in 1968 a part of the necropolis was examined. Though the excavation of Lepenski Vir had not been completed, the superficial area Of 2&nbsp;500 square metres investigated showed that the culture revealed there was a completely new feature in European prehistory.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskiview2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskiview2sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski" width="250" height="141" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />A closer shot showing the shelf of Lepenski Vir in the process of excavation.

Its stratigraphy has been plotted, the basic elements of its structure are known and the course of its development is clear. None the less, it is today a phenomenon isolated in time and space. The forms of a highly developed culture, a permanent settlement with an architectural plan which presupposes complex socio-economic relationships, and examples of monumental art certainly imbued with a profound religious sense, have been found at Lepenski Vir, initially a featureless area affording no sort of expectation of discoveries, nor of any tradition of earlier settlement. On the other hand, all the essential forms of the Lepenski Vir culture differ completely from the general cultural-historical pattern of the early prehistory of Europe. It seems that nothing created in the Danube Basin before or at the time of the flowering of the Lepenski Vir culture (Early and Middle Stone Age) can explain its exceptional nature, nor are its highly expressive activities endorsed by the events that directly followed it (the beginnings of the oldest culture of the Late Stone Age, Star&#269;evo-K&ouml;r&ouml;s-Cris types). The Lepenski Vir culture had its precursors but not its ancestors; its heirs are known but not its descendants.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskiview3.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskiview3sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski" width="224" height="250" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />The slopes of the Kor&#353;o hills above Lepenski Vir are overgrown with virgin forests of oak, walnut, hornbeam and hackberry.<br /><br />Photo: "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />These facts make the scientific approach to the Lepenski Vir culture difficult and call for a prior investigation of the basic development of the cultures of the early prehistory of the Danube Basin and of Europe. This type of investigation, however, presents certain difficulties. Insufficient field work has so far been carried out in the districts of the Danube Basin, especially Djerdap and its immediate vicinity. If the cause is to be judged by the effect, then one must conclude from the evidence of Lepenski Vir that the cultural past of the Danube Basin is far richer and more complex than has hitherto been suspected. Lepenski Vir is exceptional and distinct not only because of still unrevealed evidence from the cultural history of the Danubian lands but also on account of the limitations inherent in the standard archaeological nomenclature, above all in the classic and generally accepted division of the early prehistory of Europe into Early (Palaeolithic), Middle (Mesolithic) and Late Stone Age (Neolithic). <br /><br />In this scheme, which is basically an over-simplification of the idea of the straightforward development of culture, no provision has been made for subtle variations, exceptional development, lack of continuity or sudden transformations - in short, for all those countless departures from the norm that exist in real life, a number of which must have taken place just at Lepenski Vir. As will be seen later, the newly revealed culture of Lepenski Vir contains certain features which could equally be appraised as Palaeolithic (art, religion), Mesolithic (economy) or Neolithic (permanent settlement). Looked at collectively, however, they represent a new phase in the early prehistory of the Danube Basin, a distinct stage of culture which emerged over centuries and without which it would not be possible to accept the two most significant advances of the 'Neolithic Revolution' that lay ahead: agriculture and stockbreeding.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskiview4.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskiview4sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski" width="167" height="250" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><a href="images8/lepenskiromania.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images8/lepenskiromaniasm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="267" height="200" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Treskavac - a bare porphyritic cliff (679 m high) which rises on the left bank of the Danube opposite Lepenski Vir like a giant sentinel of the prehistoric settlement. <br /><br />Photo: (left) "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972<br /><br />Photo: (right)  http://outdoors.webshots.com/album/558132902opfLBE?start=12<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />The stratigraphy of the Lepenski Vir culture shows that it was formed before the beginning of the Early Neolithic in the Danube Basin, i.e. before 5000 BC. However, its rich and original features are hard to reconcile with the more or less contempory elements of the Mesolithic culture of the Danube Basin and within the context of the earliest Neolithic cultures in the south of the Balkan Peninsula, 'in Macedonia (Nea Nikomedeia), Thessaly (the Pre-Ceramic Neolithic of Argos) or central Greece (Elateia). Compared with Lepenski Vir the Mesolithic forms of these areas seem amorphous and extremely poor, and the earliest Neolithic forms unoriginal and monotonous. This shows that the tenor of the Lepenski Vir culture differed from that of contemporary or subsequent cultures; its roots go farther back into the past and spread well beyond the boundaries of its native district.<br /><br />It is difficult today to establish where and when it was that the ground was prepared for the emergence of the Lepenski Vir culture. Geographically, Lepenski Vir lies almost on the frontier between the middle and the lower Danube Basin, otherwise Djerdap, connecting the Pannonian Plain with the Wallachian and Pontic Basins. The region of the middle and lower Danube Basin is not, however, a closed geographical area. It is closely linked, by the many tributaries of the Danube, with all the other areas of central and south-eastern Europe, which means that Lepenski Vir could be an integral part of the prehistory of all that extensive area. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the origins of the Lepenski Vir culture lie in the areas which are directly or indirectly linked to the Danube.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskidig1.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskidig1sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski" width="250" height="168" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Lepenski Vir I - the south eastern part of the settlement.

There are few remains of the Early Palaeolithic and only from the Middle Palaeolithic period onwards is it possible with any certainty to reconstruct the culture movements in the Danube Basin. Moreover, the culture of the Middle Palaeolithic, characterized by cave dwellings, flint weapons of moderate size and the complete absence of any creative artistic sense, does not tally with any of the features of the Lepenski Vir culture.<br /><br />Djerdap is one of the most remarkable natural regions in Europe. This gorge, not quite a hundred kilometres long, is a world of its own, restricted but not monotonous, infinitely varied and dynamic. Within short distances, both in a vertical and a horizontal direction, soil, climate, fauna and flora quickly change; whereas the winds howl around the cliff tops covered with sparse oak or pine, at the foot of the cliffs, beside the water, grow holm-oak, finger-ferns, sycamores and hackberries. Often, not more than a kilometre away, also by the water, quite a fresh ecological zone exists, with differing soil, climate and way of life. Nowhere else in Europe does a territory, topographically enclosed and manifesting the same overall biotype, contain such numerous and local variations as in Djerdap. Nowhere, in a single area, are there so many surprisingly different landscapes and so many varied forms of forest, scent and colour.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this unusual world Lepenski Vir holds a special place. Djerdap, which cuts through the southern Carpathians between the Pannonian Plain and the Wallachian-Pontic Basin, has, on the whole, a west-east orientation, but its middle reach veers to a south-easterly direction, so that the Danube at this spot achieves great speed, creates its biggest whirlpools and carves gigantic sculptures from the rocks which rise from the river bed. In this part of Djerdap, on the sunny right bank of the Danube, lies Lepenski Vir, a small horseshoe-shaped shelf protected by dense forest and high cliffs. The site is in eastern Serbia, on the frontier between Serbia and Romania at a height of from 59 to 66 metres above sea-level.<br /><br />From Lepenski Vir one can see the course of the Danube for almost six kilometres with its rocky banks rising precipitously to between 250 and 700 metres. Two kilometres to the north and six kilometres to the south, high cliffs constrict the river, shut out the view and form a huge isolated amphitheatre around Lepenski Vir. Out of the river bed upstream rise two enormous porphyry rocks, whereas downstream the Danube thunders noisily over a long underwater ridge and is then quickly lost to sight beyond the cliffs of the Bo1jeti hills. Here the river becomes a terrifying force in constant movement. Above, on the heights, the undulating summits of the southern Carpathians close the circle around the river and when the clouds or mists hang low over their peaks the whole area is shut in and becomes even more restricted, with no apparent way out. This isolation makes climate, vegetation and the whole rhythm of life at Lepenski Vir different from those in other parts of the gorge.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskidig3.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskidig3sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski" width="250" height="203" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Lepenski Vir I - the north eastern part of the settlement looking towards the Danube.

At Lepenski Vir the normal east or west winds are cut off by the sudden southward bend of the Danube. Consequently this area has its own distinct micro-climate, marked by uniform rainfall, mild transitions between seasons, a considerable relative humidity, and the absence of strong winds or of extreme temperature variations (see Appendix 1). Its wholly sheltered situation, the limestone subsoil which retains warmth, and the river with its mists which hang over the waters and move slowly along the eddies have made possible the survival in this part of Djerdap of many rare and very archaic forms of life.<br /><br />At Lepenski Vir, situated in the middle of a forest belt about three kilometres long, many types of vegetation still survive which have died out even in the immediate vicinity because of the extreme climatic variations in the course of the Ice Age and the Post-Glacial period. The Mediterranean varieties which flourish there today, especially the hackberries, grew around Lepenski Vir in the Pre-Boreal period, together with birch, juniper, pine, spruce, tsuga and beech. The remnants of surviving forest show that there has been a continuity from the Tertiary to the present day, that is to say the climatic changes of the Quaternary, which caused such havoc in much of the world in other parts of the Danube Basin, only partially restricted or extended the already existing life cycles in the area of Lepenski Vir.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskidig4.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskidig4sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski" width="245" height="250" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Lepenski Vir I - the south eastern part of the settlement (seen from the Danube bank).

The presence of considerable quantities of birch pollen and the sporadic appearance of tsuga pollen in the lowest levels at Lepenski Vir bear witness to the harsher climate, certainly very cold on the summits of the surrounding hills, but warm enough near the water, as is proved by the hackberry and beech pollen found. The river, the bank, and all the features of the area were, however, the same.<br /><br />The first settlers at Lepenski Vir found not only a raised terrace sheltered from the harsher winds and the flood waters of the Danube, but also an abundance of life in the forest and the waters. The spot chosen for building the settlement was clearly the most suitable in the area; on the southern and northern sides it was bordered by low crests of dark red porphyry, on the west by the steep slopes of the Kor:so hills, while to the east, on the left bank of the Danube, rose the bare summit of Treskavac, 679 metres high, like a gigantic sentinel of the settlement. North of Lepenski Vir the bank is high, at times almost vertical, and to the south low and easily accessible as far as the mouth of the river Boljetinka and its gorge which provides a short route to the mountainous hinterland.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskidig5.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskidig5sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski" width="250" height="185" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Lepenski Vir I - the north eastern part of the settlement (seen from the Danube bank).

Except for the narrow valley of the Boljetinka, seventeen kilometres long, there is not a single route in the whole district leading into the interior of the country. It is possible to make one's way along the Danube bank, but generally only when the water level is low. Even then it is a long and laborious Journey to reach the mouth of the river Pore&#263; on the right bank of the Danube or the mouths of the rivers Berzaska and Cerna on the left, whose valleys lead, respectively, southward into the Homolje mountains or northward to the Transylvanian Alps. <i>(note, however, that these restrictions do not apply to boats.

On the other hand, the Danube at this point penetrates the core of the southern Carpathians and makes easily accessible the varied rocks and minerals which exist in them. Above Lepenski Vir itself sediments formed during the Jurassic and Calcareous period are exposed: grey-green sandstone, reddish limestone and bluish-grey marl. A little farther on, the waters have laid bare Palaeozoic schists, granite, serpentine and gabbro, as well as Permian formations of porphyrite and red sandstone. Furthermore, when the water level is low, the Danube leaves behind on the bank a brilliant polychromatic mosaic of ores and minerals brought down by the swift-flowing tributaries from the mountainous hinterland. There are also shells, snails and fossils washed out from the shattered rocks, and along the bank itself stretches dense forest, with oaks, hackberries and long sinewy creepers and countless other growths which could serve as firewood and excellent building material.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskidigfoundations.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskidigfoundationssm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski" width="175" height="200" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Foundation stones of house No. 3 (Lepenski Vir Ib).

The first settlers of Proto-Lepenski Vir inhabited only the lowest terrace by the bank. Only on this terrace, formed in the course of the Late Glacial period, Dryas 2-3, in sandy yellow sterile loess with an average depth of 0.5 m above red porphyrite have the modest remains of the first settlement been found. <br /><br />At first the south eastern part of the terrace in the immediate vicinity of the great whirlpool was settled, and the settlement then gradually extended up stream to the north west as far as the cliff which limited the shelf at its northern end. The settlement was never very large, but it covers a large time span. <br /><br /><i>(Note, however, that although  Srejovi&#263; posits that this is the first settlement at this site, there is no dating evidence for the age of Proto-Lepenski Vir - Don)</i><br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskicontours.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskicontourssm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="300" height="184" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Topographical map of Lepenski Vir showing the area investigated. <br /><br />Photo: "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />The edge of the settlement along the river bank was slightly concave, and nearly level along its width. The settlement was only about 12 metres wide in the central portion, gradually decreasing in width at either end. The buildings were distributed about 5 to 12 m. from each other. The river must have been an ever present danger as well as a source of water and food, for the Danube floods regularly. <br /><br /><p><a href="images8/protolepenskigrave.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images8/protolepenskigravesm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="167" height="200" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />A grave discovered in the south-eastern part of the settlement of Proto-Lepenski Vir. The shape of this grave, as well as the position of the skeleton, is quite exceptional.

All the dwellings were about fifteen metres from the present river bank. The terrain between the dwellings and the river is almost flat and an ideal open air  living area. <br /><br />Behind this first settlement the stony substrate  begins to surface through sandy alluvial and wind borne deposits, sometimes forming small recesses and thus shelters which were incorporated into the architecture of the first settlement. <br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskixsection.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskixsectionsm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="300" height="136" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Cross section of Lepenski Vir showing the area investigated. <br /><br />Photo: "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />Only the nuclei of the first settlement remain. The hearths are discernible, with household implements of stone and bone. The living spaces cannot be delineated from their surroundings. There are no traces of walls or roofs, and it is assumed that the house foundations are not preserved because of the loose sandy ground, unfavourable for the preservation of wood and post holes. In any case, any post holes which may have been made were not reinforced with stone, another indication that the roofs were lightweight, without the need for secure foundations. <br /><br />The hearths are the only clear architectural elements of the first settlement, but they are painstakingly constructed on a standard design. All the hearths are  built of vertically placed limestone slabs (easily obtained from the slopes nearby) usually with dimensions of 30 x 25 x 10 cm, as well as smaller fragments. Since the grey limestone slabs are placed vertically the depth of the hearths is around 30 cm. The hearths were around 0.8 m to 1.0 m long, by about 0.20 m to 0.25 m wide. <br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskixsection3.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskixsection3sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="300" height="105" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Cross section of the culture layer of Lepenski Vir. <br /><br />Photo: "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />The first settled south eastern section had rectangular hearths constructed on the ratio of 4:1 with regard to length to width. By the time the north western area was settled, the ratio had changed to 3:1.  In all cases the hearths are about the same distance from the river bank, with their long axes pointing to the river. This implies a similar orientation of the dwellings. <br /><br />However the lack of any indication of foundations implies that the roofs of the dwellings were exceptionally lightweight, possibly woven or plaited reeds or skins, which have since completely disappeared. Despite this lack of clarity as to the layout of the houses, it is characteristic that the household goods and animal bones are concentrated on the western, narrower side of the hearths, away from the river, and were never found on the eastern side. This shows that the hearths were not placed in the centre of the living space, but were near the eastern side of the dwelling. <p><a href="images7/lepenskixsection2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskixsection2sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="200" height="94" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Cross section of the inhabited area of Lepenski Vir. <br /><br />Photo: "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all">Thus, one of the foundation boundaries passed close the narrow eastern side of the hearth. The boundary of the western side would be close to the boundary of the household detritus. In some cases the pile of animal bones extended as much as 2.5 to 3 m. westward from the hearth, usually right up to the rocks sticking up out of the subsoil forming the next level of the site. Since the hearth was about one metre long, the total depth of the building must have been at least 3.5 to 4 metres. <br /><br />The recesses formed by the stones at the  back, and in one case also a part of a bow shaped stone surround which has been preserved, suggest that the contours of the foundation were rounded, forming a circle, an ellipse or some allied shape. On the basis of the architecture of the next phase, Lepenski Vir Ia, one may suppose with some degree of certainty that the foundations of the first dwellings at Lepenski Vir were egg shaped, the narrower end turning towards the slopes of the shelf and the wider end facing the river. Such a shape fits ideally into the relief of the terrain, into the pockets and recesses formed by the rocks in the subsoil and on the slopes of the shelf above. Thus when seen as a whole in combination with the foundations, the shape of the roofs may well have been  that of a funnel, with a circular cross section. <br /><br />The hearth is once again integral to the final design, since the 4:1 ratio of the hearth is reflected in the length of the dwelling in relation to the hearth, also 4:1 at least in the earlier settlement in the south-east. However in the later dwellings of Proto-Lepenski Vir situated in the north-west, the slabs are no longer placed vertically, but are placed horizontally. This has the effect of defining the hearth more clearly. In addition the ratio was changed to 3:1 for the ratio of length to width. This method is the one used in Lepenski Vir I which indicates that these hearths of Proto-Lepenski Vir are indeed later versions, since they comply so closely with the style of Lepenski Vir I. <br /><br /><br /><br /><big><b>Lepenski Vir I<br /></b></big><i>(adapted from "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972)</i><br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskicolour1.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskicolour1sm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="200" height="127" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br />Lepenski Vir I.

The buildings are crowded together, often cutting into or covering one another. Building activity over this long period of time was intensive; houses were continually being put up, renewed, extended or rebuilt.

Methods of house building, the design and arrangement of the houses, as also the main communication paths, were similar in all five levels. Not a single change was made subsequently in the basic structure of the nucleus of the settlement. This was not a sign of creative stultification but the acceptance of the values expressed at the tme of the initial cultural upsurge and subsequently confirmed by tradition. <br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskiichouse45altar.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskiichouse45altarsm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski" width="169" height="200" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />The hearth in house No. 45; between it and the stone 'table' is an altar carved in the semblance of a fish. <br /><br />Photo: "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />Lepenski Vir Ia was the work of an exceptionally gifted generation. At a most surprising speed, and without discernible preparation or experimentation the final form of the houses was determined, definite limits were laid down for the settlement, and new methods, proportions and building materials were found. <br /><br /><i>(Note that the architecture of Lepinski Vir Ia (and later) is repeated at <A HREF ="padina.html">Padina B</A>, <A HREF ="vlasac.html">Vlasac</A> and at Stubica.

Only such a leader could have seen the potential of the sites which had limited space which needed to  be used in the most efficient way possible, and a way of adapting to them which could have allowed the villagers to make the most of the sites and the resources available. That this method and tradition continued for so long and in more than one place is a tribute to this organisational and building design genius(es). It is also apparent that the people of the sites had the same or similar religions and world views, and that there was communication between the peoples of the sites. It would seem that Lepenski Vir Ia was the first of the sites thus to  be utilised in this way, but Padina and Vlasac followed the tradition soon after. Not much is known about Stubica, except that the architecture was similar. The rising waters of the dam precluded major field studies at Stubica so far as I can ascertain. - Don.) </i><br /><br /><br /><br /><big><b>Lepenski Vir Ia<br /></b></big><i>(adapted from "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972)</i><br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskiiaplan.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskiiaplansm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="400" height="179" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Lepenski Vir Ia showing the disposition of the houses and their plans and aspects. <br /><br />The important house No. 54 is shown in red, and the market place in front of it has been added to the original drawing. <br /><br /> Photo: "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972<br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br />Lepenski Vir Ia began with the discovery of new building materials and of a new building technique. It closed with the occupation of the central area of the shelf whose outlines also became the firm boundaries of the settlement. Of the eighty five houses excavated at Lepenski Vir I, twenty two certainly belong to Lepenski Vir Ia. Since they occupy almost the entire area of the shelf, it is certain that in the first building phase not more than thirty houses could have been built. <br /><br />All the houses of the Lepenski Vir Ia phase are built of similar materials and in the same manner. They have an identical internal construction and similar proportions. They differ only in size. <br /><br />In their construction wood and various types of stone in warm red, yellow and grey tones (limestone and sandstone) were employed; these are the colours of the bare cliffs in the immediate vicinity of Lepenski Vir. Whether the houses are on level ground or on the steep slopes of the shelf, one notices that the same system of measuring the terrain, establishing the foundations and building the superstructure has always been used.<br /><br />The foundations of all the houses have the same trapezoidal form or, more accurately, form the sector of a circle with a subtended angle close to 60&deg;. This shape is clearly defined and completely closed but is not geometrically rigid. It appears to have been variable, and houses were widened or narrowed within the design of a great circle, like a fan. It is difficult, however, to establish accurately the manner by which this strange, dynamic fan became the permanent feature of the inhabited area of the Lepenski Vir culture. A casual glance at the ground-plan of the houses is enough to convince one that their shape has no model in nature. Indeed, it may be concluded, by a careful comparison of all the foundations and measurements, that the builders of Lepenski Vir possessed a quite definite mathematical knowledge which they employed skilfully in measuring the terrain and fixing the proportions, shapes and dimensions of the houses.<br /><br />The foundations were laid out on a system of triangulation. It always began with the fixing of the opening in the front of the house and the dimension thus obtained was applied to the sides which meet at the rear of the house. In this way a regular isosceles triangle was obtained. The final shaping of the foundation and all further construction, followed this triangle.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskihouse37plan.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images7/lepenskihouse37plansm.jpg" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="400" height="363" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />Foundations of house No. 37 showing the basic measurements for the construction of the houses of Lepenski Vir I.<br /><br />Photo: Figure 8, "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972<br /><br /><i>As can be seen on the diagram at left, the original isosceles (in this case equilateral) triangle was truncated at a point three quarters of the length of the two equal sides of the triangle, this truncation forming the rear of the dwelling. Three post holes were placed equidistantly at the front of the dwelling. Two further post holes were placed half way down the equal sides of the original isosceles triangle, or two thirds of the way along the now shortened sides, as shown.  This gives final dimensions of four-three-one for the front, sides and back of the house. <br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images9/redgreentrianglekeepbig.gif" target="blank"><img src="images7/redgreentriangle.gif" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="512" height="503" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "right"></a><br /><br /><br /><br />For comparison purposes I have superimposed a red equilateral triangle on the diagram for the foundations of house No 37, which has been further divided to show the relationships. <br /><br />In addition, the front of the house was traced out as an arc, with the centre of the arc the original apex of the equilateral triangle, shown on the diagram in green. If this extra area, an apron at the front of the house, was under a roof, as seems likely, it is probable there was a roof tree to support the roof structure cantilevered forward of the three front posts. <br /><br />The original foundations diagram for house No. 37 shows the disposition of the main poles as black circles. I have added the positions of the extra pair of poles (using blue circles) used for the "large" houses, again placed by the builders of Lepenski Vir at  the standard distance of A/2. It is interesting that the builders did not see the need for putting substantial poles with rock strengthened holes in the ground at the very rear of the dwelling, no matter what size house was constructed. <br /><br />The load supporting rear poles would certainly have been unnecessary if, as I have speculated elsewhere, the ridge pole was extended to the apex of the triangle and securely bedded in rock.- Don</i><br /><br />The edge of the foundation was bordered by a trench about 15 cm. wide and 10 cm. deep, filled with fine chippings at the rear and coarsely broken stones along the laterals. This provided a sleeper-trench for the shaped beams which acted as stays. <br /><br />Post holes in the larger houses were lined with stone blocks and slabs placed vertically. The smaller houses did not have these stone linings while the larger ones had two  additional post holes (one extra on each side) on the sides. But, whatever the number of supports, it is significant that the placing of the post holes at the edge of the foundation still adheres to the design of the original isosceles triangle. All three post holes on the house frontage are arranged along the base line of the triangle (in the middle of the base and in the apices of angles near the baseline). Where there are extra post holes along the sides, as is the case in the larger structures, these post holes are placed at distances corresponding to one quarter of the distance across the front, and one quarter of the sides of the original (close to equilateral) triangle.  </p><br clear ="all">The placing of the constructional supports determined the shape of the internal living area of the houses. The nucleus of the internal arrangement was the hearth built of stone blocks which formed a rectangular trench. Unlike the hearths of the Proto-Lepenski Vir phase, those in the Lepenski Vir la houses are always built of large and heavy slabs whose dimensions are usually 100 x 50 x 40 cm. or 60 x 40 x 35 cm. Furthermore, two new elements closely associated with the hearth appear regularly in the foundations of the houses, namely stone thresholds which link the shorter side of the hearth facing the frontage with the centre of the arched edge of the foundation, and a great egg-shaped or spherical boulder with circular recesses in the middle. <br /><br /><i>Note that the egg shaped boulder with circular recesses is not placed randomly. It is placed on the symmetrical axis of the house, and is carefully positioned so that it is one unit of length (in line with a position A/2 along the sides of the equilateral triangles on the diagram) from the front middle post of the house. It is at the apex of the blue triangle in the diagram above. The depth of the house as measured from the front central post is 2.6 times the basic A/2 unit, not 3 times, because of the trigonometry of equilateral triangles. The depth of the front stone apron brings the total length of the (actual) house up to a little more than the 3 times dimension, (3.13 for the purists!) since it would have been measured and marked out using a cord fixed at the original apex of the triangle, with the cord at a length corresponding to the width of the house at the front between the two outside posts.  - Don</i><br /><br />The width of the hearth is always one third of its length.<br /><br /> <i>The stone thresholds which occupy the area between the arced front of the foundations and the hearth may well have been constructed in order to provide a solid entry area impervious to occasional rain and snow. - Don</i><br /><br />Whereas the surveyeying of the terrain, the establishment of the contours of the foundation and the disposition of the objects in the interior of the house represent a real architectural achievement, the structure of the floor which overlies the foundation and consolidates all the constructional elements at once shows a significant technological discovery already made at the beginning of Phase Ia. <br /><br />The floors of the houses in the Lepenski Vir I settlement are of exceptional construction. Their basic mass is composed of the sandy, marly red limestone which is found above Lepenski Vir itself on the jagged slopes of the Kor&#353;o hills. Laboratory analysis of the floors shows that they possess the so-called residual magnetism which is a consequence of baking. <br /><br /> This in practice means that the preparation of the flooring for the houses followed a regular technological procedure; the local red limestone was baked, and then by adding water, sand and gravel a viscous mass was obtained with the qualities of lime mortar. <br /><br /> This mass was poured over the foundation of the house and all the constructional details - the stone blocks which form thehearth, the thresholds, the rounded boulder in the centre and the stone slabs which line the post holes for the supports of the upper construction - were all embedded in it. <br /><br /> It was then smoothed before it hardened, and in some houses the floor was subsequently decorated with a thin red or white polished composition. Only after a certain time, when all moisture had dried out, did the floor attain the necessary firmness which meant it could be trodden on and used for daily living. Today it seems petrified, like natural breccia. <br /><br /> <i>This appears to be one of the world's first uses of lime mortar, in this case as a floor covering, not as mortar between bricks or stones. <br /><br />What is today considered to be the oldest concrete dates back in 7000 BC and is located in south Galilee, Yiftah El, in Israel . It was discovered in 1985 when a bulldozer was opening a street and forms a kind of floor. It is made of a mixture of lime with stones. Burnt lime (quicklime) when combined with water and sand forms a  mortar which coming into contact with the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere becomes more stiff and renders a solid compound. If this mortar is mixed with stones, it bonds together the stones and forms a type of concrete. (this reference to the Israeli concrete comes from http://www.hcia.gr/2.html)<br /><br />The earliest other known use of lime mortar dates to about 4000 BC in Ancient Egypt. Thus, the Lepenski Vir Ia culture's use (~5600 BC)  of lime mortar predates the Egyptian use by 1600 years. <br /><br />The following is adapted from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Lime mortar may be  created by mixing sand, quicklime, and water.<br /><br />The earliest known use of lime mortar apart from Lepenski Vir dates to about 4000 BC in Ancient Egypt. <br /><br />Quicklime is made by the following simple process:<br /><br />    CaCO<sub>3</sub> + heat &rarr; CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>.<br /><br />   1. Calcination: heat limestone or marble, both of which contain primarily calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, to 900&deg; C.<br />   2. The excessive heat then causes carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>, to be released as a gas.<br />   3. The result is quicklime, CaO (calcium oxide).<br /><br />When this quicklime is then mixed with water it forms calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, also called hydrated or slaked lime. As the mixture dries the slaked lime reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>, to form back into solid calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, releasing yet more (evaporating) water in the process. <br /><br />Lime mortar dries very slowly. In some buildings, lime mortar made of quicklime and sand alone may take several years or even decades to completely solidify as this process relies solely on the re-absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide back in the mortar to form calcium carbonate. <br /><br />It would seem, then, that the material used for the floor of the Lepenski Vir dwellings must have either had something added to it to hasten hardening, or perhaps the original marly limestone (marl means a stone which contains limestone and clay) contained enough minerals to act in a similar way to Pozzolana. <br /><br />It should be noted that a modern replacement for Pozzzolana is rice husk ash from rice padi fields - so it may be that something similar could have been used by the Lepenski Vir inhabitants. Certainly they had plenty of wood ash. Whether this would work in the same way as rice husk ash is unknown. It would seeem that the additive needs to have high acidity to react with the alkaline slaked lime, but wood ash in my experience is usually alkaline, not acidic. <br /><br />Pozzolana is a fine, sandy volcanic ash, originally discovered and dug in Italy at Pozzuoli in the region around Vesuvius, but later at a number of other sites. Vitruvius speaks of four types of pozzolana. It is found in all the volcanic areas of Italy in various colours: black, white, grey and red.<br /><br />Finely ground and mixed with lime it acts like Portland cement and makes a strong mortar that will also set under water. It transformed the possibilities for making concrete structures, although it took the Romans some time to discover its full potential. Typically it was mixed two-to-one with lime just prior to mixing with water. The Roman port at Cosa was built of Pozzolana that was poured underwater, apparently using a long tube to carefully lay it up without allowing sea water to mix with it. The three piers are still visible today, with the underwater portions in generally excellent condition after 2100 years.<br /><br />Pozzolan is a siliceous and aluminous material which reacts with calcium hydroxide in the presence of water to form compounds possessing cementitious properties at room temperature. This allowed it to be used in the Roman Empire to make cement by combining with lime and water. Pozzolanic ash occurs naturally in volcanic deposits from Pozzuoli and Naples. <br /><br />The animal and fish bones found at Lepenski Vir indicate that the settlement may not have been used in the months of May, June and July (Source: the Iron Gates Mesolithic, 1996, by Ivana Radovanovi&#263;) <br /><br />If so, this would have been an ideal time to lay foundations, in late April, and allow three warm (though relatively wet) months for the foundations to harden as they absorbed CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, before the residents returned in August. High temperatures shorten chemical reaction times. - Don</i><br /><br />The floor is not of an overall even thickness.  At the edges it is only one or two centimetres thick, whereas by the hearth, at the stone blocks and slabs, it is as much as 25 cm deep. This means that every construction, every stone block or slab, in fact everything which lies on the foundation, must first have been set in place and only then was the floor poured as a whole.<br /><br /> It is uncertain whether the floor was poured when the house had already been roofed or whether the upper construction was begun only after the foundations were finally completed. There is no strong link between the floor and the superstructure and therefore both processes might have taken place at the same time.<br /><br /> All that remains of the roof structure is carbonized beams whose traces are clearly visible on the <i>(fortuitously hardened with lime mortar!)</i> floors of the houses. Since the post holes for the supporting beams on the outer edge of the foundation are set obliquely, it is certain that the houses had slanting walls, the roof beginning at ground level.<br /><br /> The row of broken stones which edge the foundation in order to prevent the roof timbers slipping, and the stays placed along the sides show that the roof must have been formed in two planes whose ridge-pole must have sloped downwards towards the back in order to let smoke from the hearth escape, . Though it is uncertain how high the house frontage was it seems likely that the ridge-pole had an inclination of from 23&deg; to 25&deg; and that the roof fell <i>(on either side)</i> at an angle of between 55&deg; and 60&deg;. <br /><br /> <p><a href="images7/lepenskiplans2.gif" target="blank"><img src="images7/lepenskiplans2sm.gif" alt = "Lepenski" width="398" height="547" hspace = "50" vspace = "25" align = "left"></a><br /><i>This does not seem to accord with either the diagram that is provided in the book by Srejovi&#263; for the cross sections and plans (see diagram at left), nor with the attention to mathematics so in evidence by the inhabitants of the site. <br /><br /> There are two problems here:<ol><li>The roof, by mathematics, by the logic of the inhabitants and by the diagram, should slope from front to back at an angle of 45&deg; or close to it. Possibly a 2 was substituted erroneously for a 4 at some point in the book's production. The height of the entrance and the depth of the house to the apex of the original equilateral triangle are  equal, or nearly so. This inevitably gives a slope of about 45&deg;, unless the builders take special steps to make it a different gradient. </li><br /><li>Some posts on the diagrams are misplaced. </li></ol><br />Close examination shows a discrepancy between the layout of the foundation for house No 37 from Lepenski Ia and the cross-sections given on page 61 in terms of the position of the pairs of side posts. <br /><br />On Figure 8, the foundation of house No. 37 is shown as a "small" house, which has a pair of posts placed, as noted above, at points <small>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &nbsp; </small> of the distance from the front to the back of the house, with another pair of posts on either side at the very front of the house, with a central post half way between these. For "large" houses, the pairs of "side" posts are placed at <small>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &nbsp; </small> and <small>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &nbsp; </small> of the distance from the front to the back of the house. <br /><br />But when we examine the cross sections, it is evident that the draftsperson has placed the side pair of posts not at the <small>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &nbsp; </small> and <small>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &nbsp; </small> points, but at either the end of the dwelling in the case of the "small" design, or at the end of the dwelling and at the <small>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &nbsp; </small> point in the case of the "large" version. It would seem that Srejovi&#263; has been let down by others in this instance. <br /><br /> I've helped produce books myself, and it is a frustrating experience when others make the decision "that's close enough" without asking the person directly responsible for the integrity of a book.

However the artist has placed the two angled posts at the front at a smaller angle than 60&deg;, and the ridge pole appears to slope at a fairly shallow angle. <br /><br />Another problem is that of rigidity and whether the houses would actually remain upright given these simplistic construction methods. There would  be a force component downwards from the front of the house to the rear, which if not allowed for, would mean that the roof would simply not stay up given the way the diagram shows the poles and other sticks which form the backbone of the roof.  <br /><br />It would seem to me that the easiest way to take care of the tendency of the roof to collapse backwards would  be to extend the ridgepole to ground level (outside the house at its rear) and rest it on a solid foundation such as a big flat rock, or the bedrock of the terrace, since many of the houses were in fact dug into the hillside in any case. In fact, the diagrams showing the roof sections and plans show just such an extension of the ridgepole to ground level, though it is never mentioned in the text.  <br /><br />Another way to take care of the problem would have been to affix, as all modern roofs do, a diagonal member across the other parts of the roof on the inside, and fasten it securely (by lashing, for example) to all the elements of the roof, but especially the ridge pole and the more solid posts of the sides of the roof. - Don</i>  </p><br clear ="all">This would give a very simple roof since the skeleton of the superstructure, which usually consisted of three pairs of poles <i>(three pairs for the larger houses, only two pairs for the smaller ones - Don)</i> and the centre post, could easily be supplemented by ranging thin wooden props at the angles. It must, however, be pointed out that such a primitive roof construction does not tally with the foundation which is solidly built and perfectly proportioned, and some other reconstruction of the house may therefore be more correct. Be that as it may, the foundation would appear to have determined the architecture of Lepenski Vir, the building always begins from the inside, from the foundation, and remains wholly dependent on it.<br /><br /> The first plan of the settlement shows that in phase Ia the whole area of the horseshoe-shaped shelf was already conceived as the interior of a gigantic house which had for its frontage the curve of the Danube bank and at its rear the steep cliffs of the Kor&#353;o hills. The contours of the sides of the settlement were less well defined, but the settled area was nonetheless quite clear and simple; by the bank the terrain is level or only insignificantly concave, but in the centre, where there is a wide tongue of land, it rises accordingly. <br /><br /> Lepenski Vir la covered an area of 1&nbsp;500 square metres, and this had to serve its hundred or so inhabitants. The living space available to them had therefore to be so organized as to avoid a feeling of restriction. They were thus compelled when building their settlement to economize on space like misers, to profit by every detail and every free corner; at the same time taking care that their freedom of movement was not unduly restricted.<br /><br />The first plan of the settlement (1a) shows that all these basic requirements were met. By skilful arrangement of the houses an open space was formed in the centre of the settlement and numerous means of communication were created which showed how adaptable was the terrain, gave depth to the whole area, and controlled the position and size of all the houses.<br /><br />The nature of the site occupied during phase Ia imposed a number of restrictions. Since the settlement was literally cut off from its surroundings, room had to be found in it not only for dwellings, but also for shrines, graves and every other individual or collective function of everyday life. The newly settled area, however, was not large. Lepenski Vir la covered an area of 1,500 square metres, and this had to serve its hundred or so inhabitants. The living space available to them had therefore to be so organized as to avoid a feeling of restriction. They were thus compelled when building their settlement to economize on space like misers, to profit by every detail and every free corner; at the same time taking care that their freedom of movement was not unduly restricted.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/lepenskicomms.gif" target="blank"><img src="images7/lepenskicommssm.gif" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="400" height="284" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br />Photo: after  "Lepenski Vir" by Dragoslav Srejovi&#263; 1972, with additions after Clive Bonsall. <i>It should be realised that although Srejovi&#263; recognised stages Lepenski Vir Ia through to Ie, later investigators have divided Lepensk&nbsp;Vir&nbsp;I into just three: Lepenski Vir I.1, I.2, and I.3.

These differences in level in the inhabited area were overcome by ramps, alleys and steps which led either down to the 'market-place' or up towards the central house. Because of the horseshoe-shape of the shelf all approaches were oriented either SE-NW or SW-NE. These intersecting lines of communication formed a framework which determined the position of all the houses. However, since ramps and steps did not always follow straight lines, but frequently curved in following the contours of the terrain, the free spaces between these intersections were not of the same size. This explains the variation in size of the houses of the settlement of Lepenski Vir 1.</p><br clear ="all">Because of the way the ground slopes, the backs of many of the houses were dug into the shelf. Whereas in the western section of the settlement such excavations sometimes reached a depth of one metre (e.g. house No. 34), the houses erected on the level ground near the Danube bank needed no excavation (e.g. houses Nos. 2b, 62a, 63a and 17). All the houses, with the exception of two in the centre (Nos. 36 and 58) are orientated along the diagonal axis of the shelf in an east-west direction, so that they all faced the river. In the centre is the largest house (54a). It backs on to the shelving shore and its high frontage closes and powerfully accentuates the open space of the central 'market-place'. Houses Nos. 36 and 58, which flank the central house in a radial manner, are oriented like the lateral axes of the shelf towards the south-east, or north-east. The 'market-place' with these three central houses forms the nucleus of the settlement in relation to which all other buildings are sited and all means of communications are centred relative to it.<br /><br /><p><a href="images7/bonsalldateslepenskimap2.gif" target="blank"><img src="images7/bonsalldateslepenskimap2sm.gif" alt = "Lepenski Vir" width="400" height="310" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><br />General plan of the Lepenski Vir I habitations, showing house locations "L", as well as radiocarbon dates of some houses based on charcoal samples. The radiocarbon ages of houses 36, 37 and 54 are weighted means of several measurements. The locations and ages of two Lepenski Vir II houses, IX and XXXII, are also shown.<br /><br />Map after: Bonsall et al, 2000, 'Stable Isotopes, Radiocarbon and the Mesolithic-Neolithic Transition in the Iron Gates', Documenta Praehistorica XXVII. <i> (Electronic reprint kindly sent to me by Dr Clive Bonsall.)</i> Locations marked in red on a yellow background after 'The Iron Gates Mesolithic',  Radovanovi&#263, 1996.Along the terrace by the river bank the shelf is about 7 metres lower than the upper terrace where the houses are 66.27 metres above sea-level. These differences in level in the inhabited area were overcome by ramps, alleys and steps which led either down to the 'market-place' or up towards the central house. Because of the horseshoe-shape of the shelf all approaches were oriented either SE-NW or SW-NE. These intersecting lines of communication formed a framework which determined the position of all the houses. However, since ramps and steps did not always follow straight lines, but frequently curved in following the contours of the terrain, the free spaces between these intersections were not of the same size. This explains the variation in size of the houses of the settlement of Lepenski Vir 1.<br /><br />Generally speaking, in all levels of settlement I the central house was the largest, for its frontage closed the 'market-place', about 10 m. wide. In phase la the foundation of the central house covered an area of 30 sq. m. and its frontage was 7 m. wide and about 5.5 m. high. <br /><br /><i>Note, Srejovi&#263; is saying here in effect that the angles of the two front side posts are  at 58&deg;. For 60&deg; the height would  be 6 m.<br /><br />Calculations for the areas and the resulting front and height dimensions  give, (see below for more detailed treatment of other areas, and using  60&deg; to obtain the front height, and assuming an equilateral triangle as the basic design, a reasonable assumption)<br /><br />For 30 sq. m. the width at the front is 8.4 m and the height is 7.2 m.<br /><br />It is not clear why there is this discrepancy in width, because Srejovi&#263; would have actually measured  both the width and the house foundation area. - Don</i> </p><br clear ="all">Since the two neighbouring houses were set back and had a different orientation, the central house dominated the area, standing out above all the other buildings of the settlement. Though the width of its frontage was approximately equal to that of the 'market-place', the open space in the centre of the settlement was not sealed off but had two main 'streets' each about 2.5 m. wide branching off from beside the facade of the central house and leading upwards towards the north-western and south-western flanks of the shelf. <br /><br />All the other main lines of communication had an approximately similar orientation as the two 'main streets' and each led towards the 'market-place'. The subsidiary roads which did not lead towards the 'market-place' and the central house but towards the river bank cut diagonally across the main communications. Whereas the latter were designed as broad, gentle ramps, the subsidiary links as a rule took the form of very narrow paths provided with short, steep steps. They always ran along the sides of the houses, whereas the ramps bordered their frontages. <br /><br />Both categories tended to vary in width throughout their length; the width of the ramps gradually contracted from the 'market-place' to the highest terraces and the subsidiary paths with steps became narrower from the bank towards the raised back of the shelf The houses, moreover, are for the most part larger in the central parts of the settlement than near the bank and on the flanks of the shelf. <i>(This accords with common experience elsewhere. Who has not noticed that a path towards the wilderness gradually decreases in width and in ease of use as you go further into the unknown?)</i><br /><br />The houses were built in four basic sizes, with foundations of approximately 5.50, 9.50, 17 and 28 sq. m. and probably varying in height from 1.8, 2.4, 2.9 to 4.1 m. <br /><br /><i>Note that these heights are at great variance with the 60&deg; standard that we would expect on the basis of mathematics, or the 58&deg;  implicit in  the value given earlier by Srejovi&#263; for the foundation of the central house which covered an area of 30 sq. m. (or 28 sq. m., take your pick. )<br /><br />Calculations for the areas and the resulting front and height dimensions  give: <br />(using  60&deg; to obtain the front height, and assuming an equilateral triangle as the basic design, a reasonable assumption)<br /><br />For 5.5 sq. m. the width at the front is 3.6 m and the height is 3.1 m. <br />For 9.5 sq. m. the width at the front is 4.7 m and the height is 4.1 m.<br />For 17 sq. m. the width at the front is 6.3 m and the height is 5.5 m.<br />For 28 sq. m. the width at the front is 8.1 m and the height is 7.0 m.<br />For 30 sq. m. the width at the front is 8.4 m and the height is 7.2 m.<br />For 35 sq. m. the width at the front is 9.0 m and the height is 7.8 m.<br />For 36 sq. m. the width at the front is 9.2 m and the height is 7.9 m.<br /><br /><br />Note also that this last value of 4.1 m for the height of the 28 sq. m. foundation area ("with foundations of approximately 5.50, 9.50, 17 and 28 sq. m. and probably varying in height from 1.8, 2.4, 2.9 to 4.1 m)" does not even match with the value of 5.5 m.  in the data for the large house Srejovi&#263; gives earlier, (? He seems to refer to this house as having a floor area of 28 and 30 sq. m. in different places.) <br /><br />Specifically, earlier he says: <b>In phase la the foundation of the central house covered an area of 30 sq. m.  and its frontage was 7 m. wide and about 5.5 m. high. </b><br /><br /> However simple calculations give values of 8.4 for the width and 7.2 for the height for a dwelling of this area. As I have noted above, it is not clear why there is this discrepancy in width, because Srejovi&#263; would have actually measured  both the width and the house foundation area. <br /><br />Later in the book, when talking about house No. 57 from Lepenski Vir Ie, he states that it has a frontage of 9 m and an area of 36 sq. m. As can be seen from my figures above, this is pretty much spot on (given the inevitable approximations of measurement in the field)  for the calculated values, where a house with foundations having an  area of 35 sq. m. has a width of 9 m. - Don</i><br /><br />The smallest houses (from 5.5 to 9.5 sq. m.) were for the most part on the level land near the bank or on the last, highest raised, terrace of the shelf; the largest (28 sq. m.) occupied a central position in the settlement. Since the height of a house depended on the size of its foundation, this meant that the verticals which indicated the height of the frontage grew in accordance with the height of the bank towards the central rise. There were some irregularities but only when specific features of the terrain called for them.<br /><br /><hr align="center"><br /><br /><h2><A HREF ="index.html#sites">Back to Don's Maps</A></h2><br /><br /><br /><h2><A HREF ="sharamudoi.html">Back to the Iron Gates</A></h2><br /><center><A HREF ="lepenski2.html"><IMG SRC = "images9/lepenski2rect.jpg"alt="Lepenski Vir" border = 0  align=middle width="200" height="100"></A><A HREF ="lepenski2.html">Lepenski Vir Ib-e, II, III</A> </center><br />   </div><!-- Closes the main content div that was set in the header --><div class="footer"><br /><br /><hr><br /><br /></center><small><br /><center><A HREF ="changes.html">Recent additions, changes and updates to Don's Maps</A> </center></small><br />        <center> This page last updated: Monday, 03rd Sep 2018 08:23

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 42 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/lepenski.html responseCode 3 200

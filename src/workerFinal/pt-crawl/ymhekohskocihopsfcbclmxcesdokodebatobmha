                            that Aboriginal native title was not extinguished - or 
                            wiped out - by the British invasion and that Australia 
                            was not terra nullius, Latin for "empty land". Koiki, 
                            or Eddie, Mabo, was a member of the Meriam People, the 
                            traditional owners of Murray Island and surrounding islands 
                            and reefs in the Torres Strait. In 1982, Mabo , the Mabo 
                            case changes the way we think about land law in Australia.
                            <p>While the sovereignty of the Crown continues, terra 
                              nullius is found to have never existed and instead native 
                              title has been recognised. Aboriginal customary land 
                              law - or native title - continues alongside British 
                              Common and statute law. Native Title was gradually extinguished 
                              parcel by parcel as colonial and later governments issued 
                              titles. Native Title is likely to exist over land that 
                              is categorised as unalienated Crown land, national parks 
                              declared over land that we unalienated Crown land at 
                              the time of the declaration, and over reserved lands. </p>
                            <p> There are two grounds for proving that Native Title 
                              continues to exist under the common law. The claimant 
                              group must prove that it owns the land under the relevant 
                              Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander customary land 
                              laws, and the descendants of the group who owned the 
                              land in 1788, must have had a continuous association 
                              with the land. In response to the Mabo case, the Federal 
                              Government passed the Native Title Act in December 1993 
                            and has establishing a national land fund in 1994. </p></td>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

      <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 411]]</font> Having 
        enjoyed the rare privilege of a personal acquaintance with this remarkable 
        bird in its native haunts, during my residence in the Aru Islands, I am 
        enabled to give a more complete account of its habits, its local and geographical 
        distribution, and some peculiarities of its structure and &#156;conomy, than 
        has yet been published, and to correct several errors and misstatements 
        which occur in all the accounts I have seen. I have supplied the deficiencies 
        of my own observations by carefully comparing the accounts of those natives 
        who shoot the birds and prepare the skins for sale, and with whom I have 
        resided for more than two months in the interior of the forests. My own 
        Malay hunters, who have shot most of the fine specimens which I have obtained, 
        have been another independent source of information.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person cannot be long in the interior forests 
        of Aru without hearing a loud, harsh, often-repeated cry, <em>wawk-wawk-wawk, 
        wok-wok-wok.</em> This is the <em>Paradisea</em>, and it is sure to be 
        heard morning and evening, besides occasionally throughout the day. It 
        is the most frequent and the loudest of all the cries in the forest, and 
        can be heard at the greatest distance. One soon becomes convinced that 
        the bird is most abundant; and it is, in fact, over a very large part 
        of Aru, one of the very commonest species. Much of the noise, however, 
        is made by the young birds of various ages, and who seem to be ten times 
        as numerous as the full-plumaged, adult males. We shot nearly a dozen 
        of the former before we even saw one of the latter. The adults frequent 
        the very loftiest trees, and are shy and wary, and so strong and tenacious 
        of life, that I know no bird of its size so difficult to kill. It is in 
        a state of constant activity, flying from tree to tree, scarcely resting 
        still a moment on the same branch, and, at the slightest alarm, flying 
        swiftly away among the tree-tops. It is a very early bird, commencing 
        to feed before sunrise; but it does not seem to gorge itself and then 
        rest half-torpid, like many fruit-eating birds, as it may be seen and 
        heard at all times of the day in a state of activity.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On examining a freshly killed bird, we see the 
        great muscular strength of the legs and wings, and find the skin to be 
        remarkably thick and tough, and the skull as well as all the bones very 
        hard and strong. The whole neck is lined with a thick, muscular fat, exactly 
        similar to that of the <em>Cephalopterus ornatus</em>, in the same position, 
        and probably serving in both cases to nourish the highly developed plumage 
        of the adjacent parts. This causes the throat externally to appear very 
        wide, and as if <font color="#990000">[[p. 412]]</font> swollen, which 
        displays to great advantage the dense, scaly, metallic plumage. The flesh, 
        as might be expected, is dry, tasteless, and very tough--to be eaten only 
        in necessity. By far the greater number of the birds I have opened have 
        had their stomachs full of fruit, and this seems to be their usual and 
        favourite food. At times, however, they seek after insects, principally 
        Orthoptera; and I have found one of the largest of the Phasmid&aelig; 
        almost entire in the stomach of a full-plumaged bird.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only for two or three months of the year, 
        during the height of the east monsoon, that the natives obtain them; and 
        this circumstance has no doubt led to the statement that they are migratory 
        in Aru, arriving from New Guinea at the end of the west, and returning 
        there again at the end of the east monsoon--which is quite incorrect, 
        as they are permanent residents in Aru, and the natives know nothing about 
        their being found in New Guinea. About April, when the change from the 
        west to the east monsoon occurs, the Paradiseas begin to show the ornamental 
        side feathers, and in May and June they have mostly arrived at their full 
        perfection. This is probably the season of pairing. They are in a state 
        of excitement and incessant activity, and the males assemble together 
        to exercise, dress and display their magnificent plumage. For this purpose 
        they prefer certain lofty, large-leaved forest-trees (which at this time 
        have no fruit), and on these, early in the morning, from ten to twenty 
        full-plumaged birds assemble, as the natives express it, &quot;to play and 
        dance.&quot; They open their wings, stretch out their necks, shake their bodies, 
        and keep the long golden plumes opened and vibrating--constantly changing 
        their positions, flying across and across each other from branch to branch, 
        and appearing proud of their activity and beauty. The long, downy, golden 
        feathers are, however, displayed in a manner which has, I believe, been 
        hitherto quite unknown, but in which alone the bird can be seen to full 
        advantage, and claim our admiration as the most beautiful of all the beautiful 
        winged forms which adorn the earth. Instead of hanging down on each side 
        of the bird, and being almost confounded with the tail (as I believe always 
        hitherto represented, and as they are, in fact, carried during repose 
        and flight), they are erected <em>vertically</em> over the back from under 
        and behind the wing, and there opened and spread out in a fan-like mass, 
        completely overshadowing the whole bird. The effect of this is inexpressibly 
        beautiful. The large, ungainly legs are no longer a deformity--as the 
        bird crouches upon them, the dark brown body and wings form but a central 
        support to the splendour above, from which more brilliant colours would 
        distract our attention,--while the pale yellow head, swelling throat of 
        rich metallic green, and bright golden eye, give vivacity and life to 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 413]]</font> the whole figure. Above rise the 
        intensely-shining, orange-coloured plumes, richly marked with a stripe 
        of deep red, and opening out with the most perfect regularity into broad, 
        waving feathers of airy down,--every filament which terminates them distinct, 
        yet waving and curving and closing upon each other with the vibratory 
        motion the bird gives them; while the two immensely long filaments of 
        the tail hang in graceful curves below<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the freshly killed specimens it can be easily 
        seen (even did not observation of the living bird prove it) that this 
        is the natural position of the long plumes. They all spring from an oval 
        fold of the skin, about an inch in length, situated just below the elbow 
        or first joint of the wing. On this point they turn as on a hinge, and 
        admit only of being laid down closed beneath the wing, or erected and 
        expanded in the manner described, which position they take of their own 
        accord, if the bird is held up by the legs, with the head inclining a 
        little downwards, and the whole gently shaken. In this manner, by slightly 
        altering the position of the body, all the forms which the plumage assumes 
        during life can be correctly and beautifully imitated. If I am right in 
        supposing this attitude to be now first made known in Europe, and our 
        taxidermists succeed in properly representing it, the Bird of Paradise 
        will, I am sure, excite afresh universal admiration, and be voted worthy 
        of its illustrious name.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious habit of the males assembling to 
        play and exercise their limbs and feathers, occurs in some other birds, 
        as the Turkeys and Argus Pheasants, and particularly in the <em>Rupicola 
        cayana</em>, which, though a true arboreal bird, has its ball-room on 
        the ground, generally on a flat rock, on which a space of a few feet in 
        diameter is worn clean and smooth by the feet of the dancers. On these 
        spots the natives set snares, and catch these beautiful birds alive. The 
        soaring of the Lark, and, in all song-birds, the exertion of singing, 
        probably results from the same desire for action at the time when the 
        moulting is completed, and the frame overflowing with health and vigour.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the natives wish to procure 'Burong mati,' 
        they search for one of the trees on which the birds assemble, and, choosing 
        a time when they are absent, construct among its branches a little hut 
        of boughs, so chosen as to afford them a good concealed station for shooting 
        the birds. They say the greatest care is necessary to make the covering 
        very close, and at the same time not too artificial; for if the birds 
        once see anything move within, they will quit the tree, and never return 
        to it. They ascend to this nest before daylight in the morning, with their 
        bow and a good stock of arrows; a boy accompanying them, who <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        414]]</font> remains crouched at the foot of the tree, to secure the birds 
        as they fall, and recover the arrows. They sometimes use arrows with a 
        large rounded piece of wood at the end, so as to make no wound; but they 
        say the bird is so strong, that it is very hard to kill them with this, 
        and they therefore prefer the usual long, pointed arrows, which transfix 
        the body and certainly bring down the bird. The assembly commences soon 
        after sunrise, and when a sufficient number are in full play, the archer 
        begins his sport, and if skilful, will shoot nearly the whole of them 
        in succession, as each bird seems so much intent on his own enjoyment 
        as not to miss his companions. In skinning, they take out the bones of 
        the head and legs, and apply ashes to the skin, a stick being pushed up 
        to the base of the beak, on which the skin of the head and neck shrinks 
        to about a tenth of its natural size. A little peg of wood is pushed through 
        the nostrils, by which the skin is hung up to dry, and a string tied round 
        the wings to keep them in their place. In damp weather the skin about 
        the base of the beak often breaks, and is then mended with pitch! and 
        the smoky atmosphere of the native houses, in which half-a-dozen families 
        have their cooking-fire in daily action, soils and darkens the whole plumage, 
        especially the pale yellow head and the delicate downy portion of the 
        long plumes. When dry, they are preserved wrapped in palm-leaves, which, 
        however, seldom cover the extreme ends of the feathers, which thus become 
        still more rubbed and dirtied. Some years ago, two dollars each were paid 
        for these skins, but they have gradually fallen in value, till now there 
        is scarcely any trade in them. I purchased a few in Dobbo at 6<em>d</em>. 
        each.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the geographical distribution of the Bird 
        of Paradise many erroneous statements have been published. Its supposed 
        migrations have by some been extended to Banda, by others to Ceram and 
        all the eastern islands of the Molucca group. These statements are, however, 
        totally without foundation, the species being strictly confined to New 
        Guinea and the Aru Islands, and even to a limited portion of each of those 
        countries. Aru consists of a very large central island, and some hundreds 
        of smaller ones scattered around it at various distances, many being of 
        large size and covered with dense and lofty forests; yet on not one of 
        these is the<em> Paradisea</em> ever found (although many of them are 
        much nearer New Guinea), being limited to the large island, and even to 
        the central portions of that island, never appearing on the sea-coast, 
        nor in the swampy forests which in many places reach some miles inland. 
        With regard to its distribution in New Guinea, the Macassar traders assured 
        me it was not found there at all; for, although they obtain quantities 
        of 'Burong mati' from most of the places they visit on the west coast 
        of <font color="#990000">[[p. 415]]</font> New Guinea, they are all of 
        another kind, being the <em>Paradisea papuana</em>, a smaller and more 
        delicate; but less brilliantly coloured species. On inquiry I found they 
        did not trade to the eastward of Cape Buro (135&deg; E.). Lesson<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, 
        I believe, found the larger species in the southern peninsula of New Guinea, 
        and an intelligent Ceramese trader I met at Aru assured me that, in places 
        he had visited more eastward than the range of the Macassar traders, the 
        same kind was found as at Aru. It is therefore clear that the <em>Paradisea 
        apoda</em> is confined to the southern peninsula of New Guinea and the 
        Aru Islands, while the <em>Paradisea papuana</em> inhabits only the northern 
        peninsula, with one or two of the islands (most probably) near its northern 
        extremity. It is interesting to observe, that though the K&eacute; Islands 
        and Goram approach nearer to New Guinea than Aru, no species of the Paradise 
        birds are found upon them,--pretty clearly showing that these birds have 
        not <em>migrated</em> to the islands beyond New Guinea in which they are 
        now found. I have, in fact, strong reasons for believing, from geographical, 
        geological, and zoological evidence, that Aru is but an outlying portion 
        of New Guinea, from which it has been separated at no very distant epoch.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In examining my series of specimens, I find 
        four such well-marked states of the male bird, as to lead me to suppose 
        that three moults are required before it arrives at perfection. In the 
        first condition it is of a nearly uniform coffee-brown colour, darker 
        on the head and paler on the belly, but entirely without markings or variety 
        of colour. The two middle tail-feathers are exactly equal in length to 
        the others, from which they only differ in having a narrower web. In the 
        next series of specimens, the head has acquired the pale yellow colour, 
        and the throat and <font color="#990000">[[p. 416]]</font> forehead the 
        rich metallic green of the old birds; the two middle tail-feathers, however, 
        are still webbed, but are now two or three inches longer than the rest. 
        In the next state these two feathers have been replaced by the immensely 
        long, bare rachides, quite equal to the greatest size they attain; but 
        there is yet no sign of the fine side-plumes which mark the fourth and 
        perfect state of the species. I am inclined to believe, therefore, that 
        this extraordinary mass of plumes is only obtained by the <em>Paradisea</em> 
        in its fourth year, and after three complete changes of its feathers. 
        This will account for the very large number of immature birds everywhere 
        seen, while the full-plumaged males are comparatively scarce. It is singular 
        that I have not been able to obtain a single adult female, my only specimen 
        of that sex being, I think, also a young bird. It is exactly similar to 
        the youngest males, of a coffee-brown all over; but in Bonaparte's 'Conspectus' 
        it is stated that the female is dusky yellow and brown, with the under 
        parts <em>entirely white</em>. This, I cannot help thinking, must be a 
        mistake, or altogether another bird; for neither myself nor my hunters 
        have ever seen one at all resembling it, out of many hundreds in various 
        states of plumage. The natives who shoot the birds are also quite unacquainted 
        with it, and always declared that the birds of a uniform brown colour 
        were the females. I am sorry I could not positively determine the point, 
        because I shall probably not again visit the districts in which the <em>Paradisea 
        apoda</em> is found. I hope, however, to obtain the allied<em> P. papuana</em> 
        on the north coast of New Guinea, and trust to be more successful in ascertaining 
        the female of that species. It is also worthy of notice that the long 
        cirrhi of the tail in the full-plumaged males vary very much in length, 
        and the shortest is often the most worn, showing that it has reached its 
        full development for the year. A specimen occurs occasionally with immense 
        cirrhi; one of mine has these feathers 34 inches long, while the general 
        length seems to be from 24 to 28 inches. I think it probable, therefore, 
        that these cirrhi increase in length each year, and that the very long 
        ones mark very old birds. The other dimensions of the bird, and the length 
        of the ornamental side-plumes, are in all cases almost exactly equal.</p>

        Notes Appearing in the Original Work</em></p>
      
      <p class="style16"><font size="-1"><sup><a name="1" id="1"></a>1</sup>A 
        note on the mode in which the male Bird of Paradise displays his plumes, 
        will be found in the Annals for February 1854, vol. xiii. p. 157.<br />
        <sup><a name="2" id="2"></a>2</sup>Since 
        writing this paper, I have, by the kindness of a German physician residing 
        at Macassar, Dr. Bauer, obtained a perusal of the 'Zoology' of the voyage 
        of the 'Coquille,' containing Lesson's observations on the Paradise Birds. 
        There is, however, a great want of preciseness in his account, owing to 
        his using French trivial names, and his not stating <em>where</em> and 
        <em>how</em> he obtained each species. He visited, I find, only the north 
        coast (Dorey Harbour) and the islands of Waigiou. His details of habits 
        refer to, and the specimens shot by himself or companions are spoken of 
        as, the &quot;petit Emeraude,&quot; which must be the <em>P. papuana</em>, Bechst. 
        (<em>P. minor</em>, Forst.). He states, however, that he procured from 
        the natives at Dorey <em>the two species of </em>'<em>Emeraude</em>,' 
        the other being, no doubt, the true <em>P. apoda</em>, Linn., which I 
        believe does not inhabit that district. They were probably obtained from 
        the Ceramese traders, who had brought them from the south or from Aru, 
        just as they offered me at Aru specimens of the <em>P. papuana</em> which 
        they had brought from the north peninsula of New Guinea. He mentions the 
        apparently large number of females, and concludes that the bird is polygamous! 
        but I have no doubt that what he took for females were mostly young males. 
        He says nothing about the vertical expansion of the plumes, which will 
        form, I hope, an important addition to our knowledge of these remarkable 
        birds.</font></p>

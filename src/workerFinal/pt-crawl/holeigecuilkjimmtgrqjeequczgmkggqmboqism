		<p><i>Reality is stubborn and troublesome and often un-Googleable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>
		David Samuels, Wired, May, 2008 (p. 155)</p>
		<h2>
		<font face="Verdana"><a name="creating"></a>Creating the Discography and 
		the Collection</font></h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I was transfixed by Sephardic music when I first 
		heard it thirty years ago. I gradually began to buy recordings in the 
		genre and then decided in the mid-1990s to collect every recording I 
		could that had even one Ladino song. Shortly afterward, I started work 
		on a comprehensive discography of Judeo-Spanish song on LPs, cassettes 
		and CDs. I did not intend to research the 78s, but the challenge 
		ensnared me and required an almost completely separate research effort. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">For the modern recordings, I drew on discographies 
		by Professors Judith R. Cohen and <i>Aki Yerushalayim</i>, supplemented 
		with wide-ranging online library research. I use Google extensively, 
		searching for example on Ladino song titles in order to find recordings 
		that include them. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I reviewed some prior discographic research into 
		Sephardic 78s, by Professor David Bunis in his "Sephardic Studies" 
		volume. The core of the research was scanning complete press runs of the 
		Ladino language&nbsp; newspapers <i>La Varah</i> and <i>La Amerika</i> on 
		microfilm, looking for recording advertisements. I also sourced copies of whatever catalogs I could, 
		principally Turkish but also French and elsewhere in the Sephardi world. 
		These catalogs are actually even rarer than the 78s themselves!</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Virtually all 78s have what are called "matrix 
		numbers" etched into the shellac, between the last few grooves and the 
		label. These numbers were entered into company studio logs when the 
		songs were recorded. I tapped into a worldwide network of collectors 
		and researchers 
		with expertise in different labels. These researchers are 
		often then able to explain where and when a given recording was 
		mastered. See the <a href="#ackn">Acknowledgements</a> below for 
		specifics. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I conducted primary research at the Library of 
		Congress, the British Library, the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, the 
		New York Public Library the Instituto Arias Montano in Madrid and 
		at the Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Library at Harvard. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I contacted collectors worldwide with substantial 
		Sephardic 78s collections, including in-person visits in California and 
		New Jersey. Last, because I also did a Union Catalog for the 78s and 
		know which institutions and collectors own which recordings, I am slowly assembling copies for 
		dissemination. <br>
		<br>
		My discographic work is intertwined with my 
		collecting.
		For both the old and new recordings, I have extensive standing searches 
		at eBay and am always adding to the collection (and so, the 
		discography.)</p>
		<h2><font face="Verdana">Supporting Research</font></h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal">A few years ago, I began using the digitized 
		collection to informally support researchers. For example, Professor Edwin 
		Seroussi was 
		writing a fascinating paper on the Sephardic song, <i>A la una</i>. He had 12 
		versions available to him at the 
		<a target="_self" href="http://www.jewish-music.huji.ac.il/">Jewish Music Research Centre.</a> I sent 
		him an additional 100 performances, complicating his life immensely! I 
		have also provided similar anthologies for Professor Seroussi's graduate 
		seminars at Hebrew University. </p>
		<p>The Jewish Music Research Centre and its AMTI label have released <i>An Early 20th-Century Sephardi Troubadour: The Historical 
		Recordings of Haim Effendi of Turkey.</i> This monumental 4-CD 
		re-release with 59 songs chronicles the liturgical and secular output of 
		this extremely influential Sephardic 78-rpm recording artist. I sourced 
		the recordings for this set, which was a decade in the making. See more
		<a href="artists/Haim_Effendi/Early_Twentieth-Century_Sephardi_Troubadour,An/Early_Twentieth-Century_Sephardi_Troubadour,An.htm">here.</a></p>
		<h2><font face="Verdana"><a name="future"></a>Future Plans</font></h2>
		<p><i>In the best of all possible worlds...the user of folk music 
		material would need only punch a few keys to gain information on all 
		occurrences of a given ballad...or by a given performer -- whether 
		recorded on commercial 78 or compact disc...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Norm Cohen, Preface, Traditional Anglo-American Folk Music</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">In an age that has seen the re-release of literally 
		thousands of 78s, the current crop of Sephardic 
		<a href="appendix-78labels.htm#rereleases">78s available in modern 
		formats</a> is meager, indeed. Known copies of over one-half of 
		the 78 rpm recordings discussed here survive in private or public collections. 
		We will collaborate with collectors and record companies to spur the 
		re-release of these 78 r.p.m. recordings on CD and the Web. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">To date we have processed close to 8,000 song 
		performances, along with accompanying graphics. When done, the digitized 
		collection should include well over 90% of the modern corpus, and half 
		or more of the 78s. The future sephardicmusic.org 
		site will list all known commercial recordings of Sephardic music, 
		including sound samples of over 10,000 performances and cover graphics. 
		Song titles in the broader discography will be linked as they are now 
		for the 78s, enabling users to easily locate all versions of a particular 
		song. We will include selected song texts as well. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">We would also like integrate the discographic 
		records from this site into Hebrew University's library system, for the 
		benefit of researchers and libraries worldwide. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It will take time, money and outside expertise to build 
		future versions of this site and integrate with Hebrew University. Please click <a href="donations.htm">here</a> if 
		you would like to offer your support. </p>

		<p>I was helped both tirelessly and cheerfully by Jean Williams, Steffie 
		Lowder and others on the 
		capable reference staff at the local
		<a href="http://www.carylibrary.org/">Cary Memorial 
		Library</a> (Lexington, MA). </p>
		<p>My discographic research drew directly on works 
		published by Professors Judith R. Cohen and David Bunis, and the <i>Aki 
		Yerushalayim </i>newsletter. Professor Cohen also answered dozens upon 
		dozens of questions over the years and graciously shared detailed 
		information from her discographies and personal collection of 
		recordings. </p>
		<p>For detailed unpublished information on multiple recordings, I would 
		like to thank Joe Elias, Alan Gottschalk, <a name="Gilb">Gilb</a>ert Humbert, Professor 
		Martin Schwartz, Jan Waas and Steve Shapiro. Professor Schwartz also

		<p>I am particularly grateful to Michael Aylward. He took time out from 
		his own monumental study of European Jewish 78s to provide detailed 
		information on Gramophone and other labels. In addition to countless 
		catalogs and logbook transcriptions he also provided substantial 
		translations. </p>
		<p>Heartfelt thanks also to Hugo Str<span style="layout-grid-mode: line">ö</span>tbaum, who 
		supplied helpful catalogs, copies of logbook listings, dating research 
		and trenchant analysis, all spiced with humor. </p>
		<p>This site as you see it would simply not have been possible without

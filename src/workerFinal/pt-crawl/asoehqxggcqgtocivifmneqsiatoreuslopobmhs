1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been asked by the editor of <em>Black and White</em> to write a short article on the subject of
my relations with Darwin in reference to the theory of Natural Selection, I gladly do so, because,
although the facts are well known to naturalists and to all students of Darwin's work, there yet
exists some misapprehension on the subject, and popular writers often exaggerate my share in the
discovery of the theory which has not only led to the almost universal acceptance of the great
principle of Evolution, but has had far-reaching effects in every department of human
knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting with Darwin</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After my return from the Amazon in 1852, I was, in 1854, preparing for my visit to the
Malay Archipelago by a study of the insects and birds of that region, when one day, I think very
early in the year, I was introduced to Darwin in the Insect-room of the British Museum, and had a
few minutes' conversation with him, but I cannot recollect that anything of importance passed
between us. While living in Borneo in 1854 I wrote a paper &quot;On the Law which has Regulated
the Introduction of New Species,&quot; in which I showed that all the main facts of geographical and
geological distribution indicated the existence of a simple law, which I stated in the following
terms: &quot;Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species.&quot; This paper was printed in the <em>Annals of Natural History</em>,
September, 1855.</p>

<p><strong>Letters from Darwin</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing that Mr. Darwin was interested in my travels and collections, and was himself
preparing some work on varieties and species, I wrote to him with special reference to this paper,
and received a very long letter in reply, telling me that he agreed with almost every word of my
article, and that we evidently thought very much alike on these subjects. He then added: &quot;This
summer will make the twentieth year since I opened my first note-book on the question, How and
in what way to species and varieties differ from each other?&quot; But neither in this nor in other
letters did he give any hint of his having already arrived at the theory of Natural Selection; while
in December, 1857, he wrote to me: &quot;My work will not fix or settle anything; but I hope it will
aid by giving a large collection of facts, with one definite end.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Darwin's Secret</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet he had actually written out a sketch of his theory in 1842, and in 1844 this sketch was
enlarged to 230 folio pages, giving a complete presentation of the arguments afterwards set forth
in the <em>Origin of Species</em>, and this extended account of the theory had been read by Sir Joseph
Hooker in 1844, and had also been discussed with him and Sir Charles Lyell for many years.
Moreover, Sir Charles had urged Mr. Darwin to publish his theory as soon as possible, because,
if he delayed much longer, someone would be sure to forestall him; but he constantly refused to
do so till he could publish all the vast array of evidential facts he had collected, and deal fully
with every difficulty that still remained unexplained. If he had not been so scrupulous in regard
to publication of a new idea supported only by a portion of the evidence he had collected, he
would have appeared before the world as the sole originator of the theory of Natural Selection;
while his subsequent works would have shown how vast a mass of evidence he had in reserve to
enforce his argument and remove the difficulties advanced by his opponents. A few words must
now be devoted to my own share in the first announcement of this celebrated theory.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The Long-Sought Law&quot;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since I had read the <em>Vestiges of Creation</em> before going to the Amazon, I continued at
frequent intervals to ponder on the great secret of the actual steps by which each new species had
been produced, with all its special adaptations to the conditions of its existence. My paper of
1855 had merely shown that each new species was in some way dependent on the circumstance
that there had been always, in the very same locality, a closely allied species, of which the new
species seemed to be a modification. I myself firmly believed that it was a direct modification of
the pre-existing species through the ordinary process of generation, as had been argued in the
<em>Vestiges of Creation</em>; but as I could not yet see any mode or process by which the change could
be effected, and the characters of the new species fixed and rendered permanent by natural law, I
left it to be inferred till such a law should be discovered. But less than three years later the long-sought law suddenly dawned upon me, and, strange to say, was suggested to me by the very same
work which had suggested the same law to Mr. Darwin sixteen years earlier. A short account of
how it occurred to me may therefore be of interest.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The Survival of the Fittest&quot;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February, 1858, I was living at Ternate, one of the Moluccas Islands, and was suffering
from a sharp attack of intermittent fever, which obliged me to lie down every afternoon during
the cold and subsequent hot fits which lasted together two or three hours. It was during one of
these fits, while I was thinking over the possible mode of origin of new species, that somehow
my thoughts turned to the &quot;positive checks&quot; to increase among savages and others described in
much detail in the celebrated <em>Essay on Population</em>, by Malthus, a work I had read a dozen years
before. These checks--disease, famine, accidents, war, &amp;c.--are what keep down the population,
and it suddenly occurred to me that in the case of wild animals these checks would act with much
more severity, and as the lower animals all tended to increase more rapidly than man, while their
population remained on the average constant, there suddenly flashed upon me the idea of the
survival of the fittest--that those individuals which every years were removed by these
causes--termed collectively the &quot;struggle for existence&quot;--must on the average and in the long
run be inferior in some one or more ways to those which managed to survive.</p>

<p><strong>By the Next Post to Darwin</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more I thought of this the more certain it appeared to be; while the only alternative
theory--that those who succumbed to enemies, or want of food, or to disease, drought, or cold,
were in every way and always as well constituted as those that survived--seemed to me
impossible and unthinkable. So deeply impressed was I with the importance of this theory and of
its far-reaching consequences, that the very same evening I sketched its outlines, and in the two
succeeding evenings wrote it out in full, and sent it by the next post to Mr. Darwin, in the full
expectation that it would be as new and startling a revelation to him as it had been to myself. I
also asked him, if he thought well of it, to show it to Sir Charles Lyell, but I said nothing about
its publication.</p>

<p><strong>Darwin's Amazement</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On its receipt Darwin wrote to Sir C. Lyell as follows: &quot;Your words have come true with a
vengeance--that I should be forestalled. . . . I never saw a more striking coincidence; if Wallace
had my MSS. sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his
terms now stand as heads of my chapters. . . . So all my originality, whatever it may amount to,
will be smashed, though my book, if it will ever have any value, will not be deteriorated; as all
the labour consists in the application of the theory.&quot; In his great generosity, Darwin wished to
have my paper printed at once, and thus give to me the priority of publication; but on the advice
of his closest scientific friends, Sir C. Lyell and Sir Joseph Hooker, he allowed an extract from
his abstract of 1844 to be presented jointly with my paper to the Linnean Society, where they
were read on July 1st, 1858, and published in the Society's journal in the following August.</p>

      <p><strong>The &quot;Origin of Speeches <font color="#990000"><i>[[sic!]]</i></font>&quot;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My own paper is reprinted in my <em>Essays on Natural Selection</em> (1870), in the preface to which
I wrote in reference to it as follows: &quot;I have felt all my life, and I still feel, the most sincere
satisfaction that Mr. Darwin had been at work long before me, and that it was not left for me to
attempt to write the <em>Origin of Species</em>. . . Far abler men than myself may confess that they have
not that untiring patience in accumulating and that wonderful skill in using large masses of facts
of the most varied kind, that wide and accurate physiological knowledge, that acuteness in
devising and skill in carrying out experiments, and that admirable style of composition, at once
clear, persuasive and judicial--qualities which in their harmonious combination mark out Mr.
Darwin as the man best fitted for the great work he has undertaken and accomplished.&quot; With
these feelings on both sides the friendship between Darwin and myself was sincere, and
unbroken to the time of his death; though owing to his delicate health, and my residence in a
different part of the country, we met less frequently than I could have wished, but the letters
published in his <em>Life</em> are samples of the considerable amount of correspondence between us.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The One Great Result&quot;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion I would only wish to add, that my connection with Darwin and his great work
has helped to secure for my own writings on the same questions a full recognition by the press
and the public; while my share in the origination and establishment of the theory of Natural
Selection has usually been exaggerated. The one great result which I claim for my paper of 1858
is, that it compelled Darwin to write and publish his <em>Origin of Species</em> without further delay. The
reception of that work, and its effect upon the whole scientific world, prove that it appeared at
the right moment; and it is probable that its influence would have been less widespread had it
been delayed several years, and had then appeared, as he intended, in several bulky volumes
embodying the whole mass of facts he had collected in its support. Such a work would have
appealed to the initiated few only, whereas the smaller volume actually written was read and
understood by the educated classes throughout the civilised world.</p>

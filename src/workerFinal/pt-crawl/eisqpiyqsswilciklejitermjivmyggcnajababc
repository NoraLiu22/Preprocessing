	  &quot;The project series Sealed Computers by Maurizio
Bolognini point us to what might form the most significant line of force in the
field of software-based art.<br>
For this installation, Bolognini places over a dozen computers in a gallery
space, networking them and having them jointly compute simple graphic structures
      which, however, deliberately do not get displayed: the monitor buses of all the
computers are sealed with wax, and the installation offers no indication of the
communication between the computers, or its results. What we can perceive are
the interconnected computers, humming, maybe processing software. They are
neither keeping a collective secret from us, nor are they even 'conceiving' of
the results of their computations as visual structures.<br>
The experience of the installation is uncanny, because we are unable to control,
or even fully understand what is going on. The aesthetical experience of the
sublime, as conceived by Romantic writers of the late 18th and early 19th
      centuries, is characterised by a confrontation with unbounded and overwhelming
nature, a transgressive experience which is not based on an appreciation for the
grandiose beauty of nature, but on a disturbed sense of amazement about its
limitless and uncontrollable force. Of course, the notion of the natural sublime
is historically associated both with, on the one hand, the experience of alpine
and maritime wilderness and natural catastrophies like earthquakes, and on the
other hand, with the progressive subjugation of nature under human will in the
course of industrialisation. The sublime is thus a paradoxical sign of both
      intimidation, and the frustration about the loss of 'natural nature'. It is a
sensation realised in the event of being confronted with some external force,
emerging from the imaginary drama of an unbridgable gap between our experience,
and the forces that move it. Closely connected to the Romantic unease about
nature is the modern unease about machines. While modernist humanism has done
everything to re-enstate human perception of a contained world as the core motor
of aesthetic experience, the emergence of technological art has brought the
sublime back into the experience of contemporary art.<br>
Bolognini's installation offers a confrontation with the 'machine' in the form
of an obscure, software-driven process which we are radically alienated from. It
points us to an 'aesthetics of the machinic' whose aesthetical experiences are
effected by such machinic structures in which neither artistic intention, nor
formal or controllable generative structures, but an amalgamation of material
      conditions, human interaction, processual restrictions, and technical
instabilities play the decisive role. Like any form of art, software art should
initiate such experiences that fundamentally put our expectations about
technology off-balance.&quot;<br>

	  <em>The Cyborg Subject: Reality, Consciousness, Parallax</em></a>, 
	  Palgrave Macmillan, London 2016, </font>&nbsp;pp. 87-88:<br>&quot;This limit 
	  of consciousness at the edge of the anthropic principle is demonstrated in 
	  Maurizio Bolognini’s Sealed Machines (1992). Described as a key 
	  development in software art, the work consists of a 
	  collection of computers, set to generate images according to Bolognini’s 
	  programming, with sealed monitor bus ports. The complete inaccessibility 
	  of the vast quantity of visual imagery created by the work references 
	  a technological sublimity of the void beneath the digital world. 
	  Meanwhile Bolognini’s intervention at the programming level, perhaps 
	  the only point at which the work could be said to be ‘viewed’, mirrors the 
	  role of the conscious observer in the anthropic principle, defining 
	  the fundamental laws of the universe as presupposed. In this split of 
	  control and inaccessibility, the engaged spectator can only be the 
	  artist himself, constructing the ‘universe’ of his work within a 
	  perceptual vacuum that creates a subjective void [...]. This creation 
	  of an inaccessible space between Real and Virtual displays the 
	  self-positing nature of Virtuality from the void, and a potential 
	  arena for reframing the emptiness of the subject. Bolognini’s position 
	  “at the crossroads of conceptual art and generative art” (Bolognini 
	  2012) can be associated with the post-conceptual practice Peter Osborne 
	  identifies as “the fictional ‘presentness’ of the contemporary” (2010) 
	  favouring presentation over representation in “the interpretation of 
	  what is through the construction of new wholes out of its fragments 
	  and modalities of existence”. Rancière’s notion of unrepresentability 
	  (2007) appears again in the necessary and affirmative conditions of 
	  representation, described by Galloway as “less a question of the 
	  failures of representation on its own terms and more a question of the 
	  historical shift out of one regime into a subsequent regime” (2011). This
	  shift towards presenting rather than representing the unrepresentable 
	  draws into art theory the shift that has occurred in quantum physics, 
	  the same shift that this thesis suggests in relation to consciousness: 
	  the necessity of an impenetrable void in order for the appearance of 
	  substance (as image, world, or consciousness in the formation of the 
	  subject). For Galloway and Rancière, for Bolognini, and for 
	  understanding the vacuum of quantum mechanics, the process by which we 
	  can speculatively engage with the unrepresentable and inaccessible void
	  is the creation of a limit, staging a similar conceptual space against 
	  which the antagonism of denied direct engagement forces the spectator 
	  to examine the relation of the surface of the work and of their own 
	  parallax position to what might lie beneath.&quot;

	  Bolognini’s Sealed Computers (1992) - an art installation of desktop

	  clearest example for me to explain what it is that got me interested in 
	  the topic (figure 0.1). The astonishment and irritation one feels about 
	  these machines’ autonomy; the impossibility of understanding what is going 
	  on; and this impossibility, this irritation, serving as the aesthetic 
	  hinge of our experience, forcing us to acknowledge the distance that we

	  190-191:<br></font>&quot;Maurizio Bolognini's <i>Sealed Computer 
	  Series</i> (1992-present) consists of about a dozen computers installed in 
	  a gallery. The computers are on the floor and interconnected with cables. 
	  They appear to be processing information, but what exactly is taking place 
	  is unverifiable. Bolognini claims that the computers are producing 
	  randomized images ad infinitum, which will never be accessible for 
	  viewing. At this point one may equate this installation with large rooms 
	  filled with servers maintained by Google and other major online 
	  juggernauts who are constantly processing online data. Unlike such 
	  servers, however, Bolognini's installation does not provide access to the 
	  information being produced. This, in effect, is an open statement on 
	  negation as an aesthetic experience. Indeed this work has been discussed 
	  explicitly in terms of the machinic sublime […]. Bolognini's work 
	  demonstrates how the aesthetics of negation are integral to the ongoing 
	  experience not just of art, but also all forms of communication and 
	  expression of ideas. It is the selective process that must be carefully 
	  understood in a time when media communication can overwhelm the senses.&quot;</p>

	  that demonstrate an abiding interest in the history of media forms and, 
	  more generally, the changing status of historical experience. [...] It may 
	  be helpful to sketch a continuum among long-duration works, several of 
	  which have become well-known in discussions of new media aesthetics. At 
	  one extreme of lateral time lies Italian artist Maurizio Bolognini's 
	  anti-cinematic <em>Sealed Computers</em>, <font face="tahoma, arial" size="1" class="auto-style18">
	  <font face="tahoma, arial" size="2">one piece in a series of <em>
	  Programmed Machine</em> works produced in the 1990s. In this work Bolognini networks 
	  computers in the gallery and program them to generate abstract images 
	  indefinitely. One doesn't actually get to see the images, as Bolognini has 
	  encased the computers in silicone to prevent access. Save for the whirring 
	  of fans cooling hard disks, there is little indication to the viewer that 
	  these computers are actually doing anything. Nonetheless, they run on and 
	  on, speculatively marking a kind of time through the production of images 
	  that we cannot see.&quot;<br><br>

	  APRIA #02: <i>Time Matters</i>, 2021, pp.35-50:<font face="tahoma, arial" size="1" class="auto-style18"><font face="tahoma, arial" size="2"><br>&quot;For an artist like Bolognini, the technological sublime resides predominantly in the field of info art and generative software, 
	  because these technologies produce something that is as much determined by the artist as it is under and beyond his control. 
	  In a sense, these technologies level the position of the artist and the viewer, who are both challenged by the force and scope of computation. 
	  ‘Computer-based technologies make available something which moves in the direction of transcending the artist,’ Bolognini writes, ‘creating 
	  a discrepancy and a disproportion between the artist and his/her work.’ In sum, Sealed Computers reflects on the fact that contemporary digital 
	  technology can evoke a sublime experience precisely because of its inherent lack or dispensability of visual representation. This is underlined 
	  by the observation that contemporary technologies are designed not to signify, but to disappear into functionality. That is why the technological 
	  sublime is characterized by ‘blank and static activity,’ critic Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe writes, ‘intelligence without gestural expression, encoding 
	  without inflection or irregularity, pure measurement, and pure power. It is found in machines which resist personification but nonetheless interact with the human.&quot;<br>

	  manifesta in <i>Sealed Computers</i> come il processo algoritmico di 
	  creazione sia una simulazione dell'atto umano di ideazione. I <i>Computer 
	  sigillati</i>, con la loro capacità fisiologica di generare contenuti, 
	  sono degli organi intellettivi, in grado di produrre contenuti artistici, 
	  sradicati dai limiti temporali della finitezza umana e posizionati nello 
	  spazio espositivo, per conservare il processo infinito di esecuzione. I 
	  computer diventano così una manifestazione dell'ingegno dell'artista, 
	  un'oggettivazione del suo ruolo di creatore di immagini, rendendo questo 
	  flusso creativo potenzialmente sconfinato nel tempo ed esprimendo 
	  sinteticamente il desiderio umano di restare al mondo.&quot;</p>

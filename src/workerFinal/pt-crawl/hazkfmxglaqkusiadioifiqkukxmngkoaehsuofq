 in the Middle Bronze and Early Iron Ages</h2>
</center>

<h3>3. The Armenian Highlands during the Age of the Assyrian and Urartian Wars and Conquests</h3>
The Mushki, the Apeshlaians, and the Urumeans</h3>
The fall of the Hittite Empire, the downfall of the lesser states
of Syria, and the weakening, for internal reasons, of Egypt and Babylonia which occurred at that time, left Assyria from the middle of the 12th century on, as the only great power in the Near East.
At the end of this century begin the campaigns of conquest of king
Tiglath-pileser I (<i>Tukulti-apal-Esharra</i>, 1115-1077 B.C). His annals
and inscriptions are our main source on the history of the Armenian Highlands for the period which followed the fall of the Hittite Empire.
<hr>
<h3>3.1. The Mushki, the Apeshlaians, and the Urumeans</h3>
Fifty years before Tiglath-pileser came to the throne, i.e., around
1165 B.C., the tribes of the Mushki (this was the Assyrians' name
for the Thraco-Phrygian tribes) crossed the Upper Euphrates and,
[68] having penetrated deep into the valley of the river Arsanias (Muratsu), occupied the countries of Alzi and Purulumzi.  Simultaneously the  Kaska  and the Urumeans also advanced into the valley of the Upper Euphrates. It is to be understood that the term "Kaska"
is a very general one, but some inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser I
specify the tribal name of these particular "Kaska"--they were
Apeshlaians, a tribe which apparently was not known to the Hittite
sources (116).  It is therefore probable that this is not simply a case
of the same  Kaska  tribes who long had troubled the Hittite Empire
resuming their raids to the south and using the empire's fall to
enlarge the field of their military activities. It is more likely that
here we witness a new ethnical movement in which new tribes
were involved. As far as the Urumeans are concerned, we have no
information about this tribe at all; we shall dwell on some hypotheses about it below. By 1115 B.C. the Mushki resumed their advance and, numbering twenty thousand men under five chieftains, they descended into the valley of the Upper Tigris (Kadmuhi), creating a serious threat to the Assyrian possessions. One may infer from the text of the annals that the Mushki must have
been in alliance with the local inhabitants. This is understandable:
in the first half of the 12th century the Assyrians had more than
once forced the Kadmuhians, Alzians, and Purulumzians to pay heavy
tribute, and the Mushki could get more booty plundering the Assyrian villages than the more humble habitations of the Hurrian mountaineers.
<p>
Having come to the throne, Tiglath-pileser I moved into Kadmuhi, inflicted a defeat on the Mushki, and, accorthng to his own assertion, took 6,000 captives. However this thd not finish the matter, since the Kadmuhians refused to pay tribute to the Assyrians and received support from the <i>pabhi</i> (the mountaineer Hurrians). Tiglath-pileser defeated the Kadmuhians and their allies in the battIe of Name (one of the lesser tributaries of the Tigris), and a "king"
of the mountaineers, one Kili-Tessub (117),  was captured along with
his family, his household gods, and the gold, silver, and bronze
utensils from his treasury. Later Tiglath-pileser laid siege to the
Hurrian mountain fortress of Urrahinash on the upper reaches of
the Tigris; its king, Shadi-Tessub, son of Hattuhe (118), surrendered to
him and was taken captive.
<p>
In the next year (1114 B.C.) Tiglath-pileser advanced to the even
more remote "country of the Subareans" (i.e., of the Hurrians),
namely, to Alzi and Purulumzi, which had also refused to pay tribute to Assyria. As the reader may recall, these regions had already been occupied by the Mushki for two generations. During this campaign a detachment of four thousand  Kaska (Apeshlaians) and [69] Urumeans, "recalcitrant warriors of the country of the Hittites, who had captured the towns of Subartu by their own strength," entered Assyrian service (119).  On his way back, the king again ravaged the
country of Kadmuhi.
<hr>
<h3>3.2. The Assyrian Offensive into the Heart of the Armenian
Highlands at the End of the 12th Century B.C. (*15)</h3> 

Information about two different campaigns is apparently combined under the third year in the annals (1113 B. C.). One of the campaigns was probably not commanded by the king in person,
but by one of his generals. Some of the countries mentioned, judging by the type of their names (120), were  probably located in the area of the Quti, to the east or northeast of Assyria. Separately
named are some of the countries of the Upper Euphrates valley--Isua (Isuwa) and Daria (121), then again certain eastern areas somewhere beyond the Lower Zab (122),  and finally the tribal league (?) of
the Sugi in the land of the Haphi.123 The names of the countries included in this league partly coincide with those which had been included in the alliance of the Uruatri. One of them, the country
of Alamun, can be identified with the valley of the Upper Zab.
<p>
The most important campaign into the Armenian Highlands took
place in 1112 B.C. Its goal was the "countries of the far away kings,
on the shore of the Upper Sea," i.e., the Black Sea (124).  According
to the information of Tiglath-pileser's annals, the Assyrians crossed
sixteen mountain ridges with clearly Hurro-Urartian names and finally passed over the Euphrates by a bridge which they laid (125)--obviously in its upper reaches, otherwise it would be difficult to
imagine sixteen ridges on the way there (126).  A tribal coalition consisting of 22,000 warriors (as the annals assure us), headed by the "kings" of twenty-three "countries" which are listed by name (127),
came to battle against the Assyrians. The names of many of these
countries in all probability are Hurro-Urartian, but none of them
belong to the well-known countries of the Upper Euphrates valley.
Probably the route lay to the east of that valley, over the central
passes of the Highlands. When Tiglath-pileser defeated this coalition, he was met by another, headed this time by "sixty kings of Nairi," not counting those "who had come to their aid." However
this greater coalition also retreated before the Assyrians, and Tiglath-pileser states that "I drove them as far as the Upper Sea at arrowpoint." Apparently the retreat of the "kings of Nairi" took
place down the valley of the river Coroh in the direction of present-day Batumi (128).  It is clear from this general picture that Haiasa no longer existed at this time (*6).
<p>

[70] Tiglath-pileser's annals characterize the result of the campaign
in the following manner:
<blockquote>
I conquered their large temple (or trading) towns, I seized their captives, I carried away their property, their wealth; their villages I burned in flames, I destroyed them, demolished them, turned them to ruins. I drove their extensive herds of horses, countless mules and hinnies, the
livestock of their meadows, without number. My hand captured alive all
the kings of Nairi; I had mercy on them, spared their lives, freed them
from their fetters and bonds before (the god) Shamash, my lord, and made
them swear allegiance in (their) slavery by my great gods for the future,
forever. I took their sons, the scions of their royalty, as hostages, I im-
posed upon them a tribute of 1,200 horses and 2,000 cattle. I allowed
them to return to their lands. I brought Seni, king of Daiene, who had not
been submissive to (the god) Assur my lord, in bonds and fetters to my
city Assur. I had mercy on him and let him leave my city Assur alive.
(Thus) I became lord of the complete extensive lands of Nairi. ...
</blockquote>
On his way back into Assyria along the valley of the Upper Euphrates, Tiglath-pileser I besieged "Milidia of Hatti," i.e., probably Hittite <i>Maldia</i>, Luwian  *<i>Malzi</i>, Aramaic MIz; present-day Eski Malatya. (One of the variants has Milidia of "Hanigalbat," i.e., Mitanni,
but this is now regarded as a scribal mistake.) The city surrendered and was not destroyed; the Assyrian king limited himself to a tribute of about one ton of lead ore annually.
<p>
It goes without saying that the intention of this campaign was
not the subjugation of the Armenian Highlands; its real goal was
only to terrorize the mountain dwellers and to plunder.
<p>
In 1110 B.C. Tiglath-pileser conducted a campaign in the valley
of the Upper Zab. Assyria's enemies here were the same ones as
during the time of Tukulti-Ninurta I--Musru, the Qumanians, Arinna, and others. Tiglath-pileser's opponents were of considerable strength: the Assyrian annals assert that the Qumanians presented
a force of 20,000, and their fortress Hunusa had a triple wall of
baked brick; there  were also towers made of baked brick in the
neighboring fortress of Kipshuna, "their royal town" (129).  As Melikisvili has shown, it was precisely here in the valley of the Upper Zab that one of the main centers of the future Urartian civilization
was in the making. It is not impossible that the society of the Qumanians had reached the state level as early as the end of the 12th century B.C. or even before that.
<p>
Summing up the results of the campaigns of the first five and
one-half years of his rule (1115-1110 B.C.), Tiglath-pileser I says
in his annals: "From the beginning of my reign to the fifth year my
hand subjected a total of forty-two countries and their rulers from
[71] the far side of the Lower (Lesser) Zab, to the far side of the Euphrates and (to) the Upper Sea of the sunset" (130). 
<p>
The series of campaigns into the Highlands ended with this, and
the Assyrian king declares: "I cut off the path of my enemies into
my land," from which it is evident that the Assyrians not only made
attacks on the mountain dwellers, but that the mountain dwellers
also made attacks on Assyria.
<p>
In the future Tiglath-pileser's campaigns were directed mostly 
against Syria. During one of them the Assyrian king, according to
his inscription, reached the Phoenician coast, and on his way back
he "took possession of the entire country of the Hittites," imposed
a tribute of cedar beams on Ini-Tessub, the "king of the great Country
of the Hittites," and occupied his city of Milidia (Milide). Apparently the Assyrians also imported "Kanes oak" from here (131).  At this time Milidia must have been the center of a state continuing the
traditions of the Hittite Empire. This must have been a kingdom
with a considerable territory, since it extended to the cedar mountains of Syria and the oak forests north of the Cilician Taurus, or had close trathng ties with them.
<p>
Continuing his march upwards along the valley of the Euphrates,
Tiglath-pileser conquered the countries Isua and Suhmu (Isuwa
and Zuhma of the Hittites).
<p>
With the beginning of the 11th century B.C. a massive penetration of the new Western Semitic tribes--the Aramaeans--into Syria and Mesopotamia started. This led to a significant weakening
of Assyria. Tiglath-pileser I and his successors were now occupied
with a continual struggle against the Aramaeans. However Tiglath-pileser's son Assurbelkala (1074-1057 B.C.) again waged war in the country of the Mushki (Alzi?), and, during another campaign, in
Musru, as well as in Hanigalbat, from which places he deported a
number of inhabitants. The mountains of Kashiari (modern Tur-'Abdin) and the country of the Haphi are mentioned; later in the same year there was one more warlike expedition, in which this king
"during the campaign against the country of <i>Areme</i> fought in the
town Murar [...] of the country of Shubre." <i>Areme</i> is here the
oblique case of <i>Aramu</i>, i.e., the country of the Aramaeans (132).  But
the "country of Areme" might also be the country Arme, later
mentioned in the Urartian inscriptions and apparently lying between Shubria, Amed, and the sources of the Tigris. From the time of Assurbelkala until the end of the 10th century plundering raids
into the Armenian Highlands occurred very seldom. This situation,
which was a happy one for the mountain dwellers, is an unlucky
one for the scholars, since the sources of information about the
Armenian Highlands run dry.

<h3>3.3. States and Tribes of Asia Minor and the Armenian Highlands by the 9th and 8th centuries B.C.*7</h3>

The political situation with which the great Assyrian and Urartian conquerors of the following centuries had to deal was gradually formed during the 11th-9th centuries B.C. During this time
Asia Minor was apparently slowly recovering after the shock of the
fall of the Hittite Empire, and in the Armenian Highlands two centuries of development almost without invasions allowed for the crystallization of a class and state civilization.
<p>
In Asia Minor the 11th-10th centuries were a time of decline,
from which society began to right itself only toward the 9th century B.C. During this time towns existed on the old sites, but their areas had markedly diminished; the emerging kingdoms were apparently unstable and small. Except for some seals with Luwian
hieroglyphic inscriptions, few texts from this period have come
down to us. The so-called "Old Phrygian" culture took form to the
southwest of the Halys, in the region of modern Konya and Nigde,
and east of the bend of the Halys, from Bogazkoy to Malatya. The
ethnic affiliation of the creators of this culture has not, however,
been established. Its typical pottery is ornamented by concentric
circles, rays, and stylized silhouettes of trees and deer. To the
northwest of the area of the "Old Phrygian" culture, in the center
of future Phrygia proper, another, monochrome pottery was in use.
<p>
More than three centuries passed after the fall of the Hittite Empire before the Phrygian Empire was created. There is no ground to suppose that the Phrygians who founded this empire were the
people who destroyed the Hittite Empire; it was ruined by the
onslaught of many different tribal groups, among which the Phrygians proper, if they were actually already on the spot, were probably neither the leading, nor the main military force. A. Goetze has
suggested that the creation of the Phrygian Empire should be dated
in the 8th century B.C; however it is likely that its nucleus was
formed earlier (133).  The Assyrians and Urartians called this empire
Mushku or Mushki.  Its capital was the city Gordion on the river
Sangarius. According to tradition, it was named for its founder, the
first great king of Phrygia, Gordias I. Actually an inscription of one
Gordias (Luw. <i>Kurtis</i>) has been found at the southernmost point
of the bend of the Halys, i.e., far outside the original territory of
Phrygia, which lay further to the northeast. The inscription is in
Luwian hieroglyphic (a special script for the Phrygian language
probably was not introduced until the reign of Midas I). Gordias
calls himself "King of the West and East" (the Luwian princes, unless they claimed the Hittite imperial inheritance, mostly styled themselves as kings of the local valleys). The legends and the [73]
 historical  sources preserve for us only two names of the kings of Phrygia
--Gordias and Midas--(134) (Assyr. Mita); presumably there were several other Phrygian kings, successively bearing these names (135) The
wealth of Midas has become proverbial. An earlier king was Ascanius, a predecessor of Gordias, but he ruled Phrygia Minor near the Sea of Marmara.
<p>
In the second half of the 8th century B.C. Phrygia achieved its
greatest might; its domain extended in the southeast to the ridges 
of the Cilician Taurus, and Midas even made attempts to penetrate
into Cilicia (136)
<p>
Phrygian inscriptions of the 8th-6th centuries are found not only
in the valley of the Sangarius, but also in the bend of the Halys
and to the east of it. In the west, Phrygia apparently controlled
Lydia and had contacts with the city-states of mainland Greece;
the inlluence of post-Achaean Greek culture on Phrygia begins to
be strongly felt especially after the fall of its empire. The "Neo-
Phrygian" ceramics are characteristic of the period of Phrygia's acme,
This appears to be a development of the Old Phrygian ceramics,
painted with geometric design. This type of pottery was popular
throughout the entire territory of Phrygia and even abroad, right
up to Pontus and Malatya. Burial mounds were characteristic for
the Phrygians  (*8).
<p>
The excavations of Gordion have shown many ties between
Phrygia and Urartu. Common to both kingdoms is the custom of
hewing niches in the rock--so-called "doors of the god"--in
front of which the deity was worshipped. The most important cult
in Phrygia was that of the Mother of the gods, Cybele (<i>Kubele,
Kubebe</i>), who was known by the name of <i>Kubaba</i> as far back as
before the Hurrians and the Hittites. Connected with her cult was
that of Attis, who castrated himself in order to escape from the
love of the goddess, thus, as it were, dying and being reborn to a
new and purer, blissful life. The self-mutilation of the priests of
Cybele and Attis was, as far as we know, a new custom in Asia
Minor, although orgiastic feasts connected with their cult had their
prototype in the earlier periods of ancient Oriental history (137). A
god of the moon, Man or Men, was also worshipped. His cult was
perhaps a continuation of the old Asianic cult of the god of the
moon, Armas. Another important goddess was Angdistis. The god
Sabazius, often mentioned as Phrygian, was actually a Thracian deity. The early Phrygians thd not have particularly close ties with the Greek West (138),  but during the 8th century B.C. an alphabet of
Phoenician derivation very similar to the Greek was introduced in
Phrygia. lt has few affinities with other alphabets of ancient Asia
Minor--those of Lydia, Caria, and Lycia. Only the Greek and [74] Phrygian alphabets are quite clearly Phoenician; the Phrygian seems to be an adaptation of the western variant of the Greek alphabet, which reached Aeolis by the middle of the 8th century B.C.
<p>
To the southeast of Phrygia several small kingdoms with Luwian
dynasties existed. An important confederation was Tabal, in the
upper part of the valley of the Seyhun and Yenice-Irmak rivers,
where in the 8th century the dynasty of Parwatas ruled (Assyr.
<i>Purutash</i>), to which several smaller "kingdoms" were subjected.
Between Phrygia and Tabal was situated the kingdom of Tyana.
<p>
The kingdom of Kammanu (Comana) can be located to the
northeast of Tabal: its capital was Melitia, or Melid (Milidia, Hitt.
Maldia, modern Arslantas--Eski Malatya). The domain of this
kingdom extended to the Euphrates, possibly even to the sources
of the Tigris. There was a period when the kingdom of Melid had
a king in common with Carchemish on the Euphrates (139); at other
periods the power of the kings of Melid stretched far to the east,
and officially the kingdom was evidently called "Hatti," thus claiming to continue the trathtions of the Hittite Empire.
<p>
The kingdom of Qummuh (Commagene) was situated south of
Malatya, while the small kingdom of Gurgum, with its capital of
Markasu (modern Marash), was wedged in between Tabal and Melid-
Kammanu, in the valley of the river Ceyhan.
<p>
The fertile lowlands on the lower reaches of the rivers Seyhun
and Ceyhan and near the gulf of Iskenderun (Alexandretta) were
occupied by the kingdoms of the Danunians and Que, or Qawe (it
is possible, however, that both are two names of one and the same
kingdom).  In the 8th century B.C. the kingdom of Cilicia (Hilakku)
is mentioned to the west of them (it is the "Cilicia" of classical
antiquity).
<p>
All these kingdoms had Luwian dynasties (140),  as was also the case
in several of the states of Northern Syria (Carchemish, which was
another claimant to the official name "Kingdom of Hatti"; the kingdom of Unqu, or Pattina on the lower Orontes); the other dynasties were Western Semitic (Samaal, or Yaudi; the kingdom of Arpad
--now Tell Erfad--with the dynasty of Agusu; the kingdom of
Hatarikka) (141).  Luwian ("Hittite") hieroglyphics and the Luwian language were used for official inscriptions in all of the enumerated states, right up to Hamath on the upper Orontes, but Phoenician
or the Aramaic dialects, and the Semitic alphabetic writing were
also used in some of them (the land of the Danunians, Samaal,
Arpad, and others). Almost all these minor kingdoms considered
themselves to be descendents of the Hittite Empire (142).  For the Assyrians and Urartians of the 9th through the 7th centuries B.C. the term <i>Hatti</i> (in Assyrian) or <i>Hate</i> (in Urartian) was either the [75] designation of all the lands to the west of the Euphrates and their
population as a whole regardless of their ethnic affiliation, or the
designation specifically of Melid (in Urartian) or of Carchemish (in
Assyrian) (143).
<p>
A "North Syrian alliance" was constituted toward the 9th century B.C. It included the kingdoms of Kammanu-Melid, Qummuh, Gurgum, Carchemish, Arpad, and Pattina; at various times the hegemony in this union belonged to Melid, to Carchemish, or to Arpad. Its rival was the "Southern Syrian alliance" headed by Damascus or Hamath (144).
<p>
To the north of the Luwian states, somewhere on the upper
reaches of the Halys or in the valley of the river Kelkit (Lycus),
there existed the important state of Kasku (Aramaic <i>Ktk</i>), named
for the  Kaska  tribe which settled there.
<p>
The country of Daiene (Urart. <i>Diauhe</i>) is mentioned to the east
of Kasku and to the north of the upper reaches of the Euphrates
(in the valley of the Choroh) from the 12th to the 8th century B.C.
In all probability it was already a state, although it included the
territories of a number of separate tribes. The union of Haiasa-Azzi,
which had existed here earlier, had by this time disappeared without a trace; the population here seems to have been Hurrian. According to the annals of Tiglath-pileser I, Seni, the king of Daiene,
occupied a leading position among the rulers of the "Nairi" as early
as the 12th century B.C. By the 8th century B.C. Daiene was one
of the richest kingdoms of the Highlands. The main trade route
from Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean Sea to the coast of the
Black Sea (145) passed along the Upper Euphrates valley and across
the pass leading into the valley of the Choroh toward present-day
Barburt (Baberd) and into the valley of the Lycus. The route acquired particular significance by the 8th-7th centuries, especially after the emergence on the Black Sea coast of the Greek colonies
of Sinope, Trapezus, and others, which constituted the federation
of the Pontus (the biblical Phut). The Greek cities exported iron
and silver ore (146).
<p>
To the northeast of Daiene (where Tiglath-pileser I had met the
coalition of the "sixty kings of Nairi"), the country of Qulha (more
accurately /Qolxa/ (147),  Greek Colchis) certainly existed in the 8th
century B.C., but possibly even earlier. When the kingdom of Diauhe
was destroyed by the Urartians, the valley of the Choroh was probably acquired by Colchis. It is significant that the Urartian sources note gold as part of the received tribute only in the countries situated along this route (Qummuh, Melid, Diauhe) (148).  It apparently
came from Colchis.
<p>
In the valley of the Upper Euphrates the earlier "countries" were [76] 
partially preserved, and some new ones formed. In the north is
mentioned the country of Suhmu (Hitt. Zuhma), lying from the
valley of Erzincan to the valley of the Arsanias (Muratsu), and Alzi
is recorded in the lower valley of the Arsanias. As we have seen,
the kingdom of Alzi was occupied by the Mushki (<i>Muska-</i> in Luwian). Alzi is thus apparently identical with the "Country of the Mushki" of the early Neo-Assyrian texts. Later the term went out of
use since Alzi in the 8th century had been conquered by Urartu.
The term "Mushki" was transferred to Phrygia (<i>Musa-</i> in Luwian).
Alzi under the Eastern Mushki was a rather important country, which
included not only the former territory of Alzi proper, but also the
former territory of Isuwa (the Assyrian sources seem to use the
term "Isua" as a synonym of Alzi) (149).  It also possibly sometimes
embraced the regions directly contiguous to the south: viz., Enzite
(Anzitene; Andzit of the Middle Ages) and the sources of the Tigris
(Angegh-tun of the Middle Ages). The Urartian sources mention the
country of Supa (Sophene, Cop'k') to the north (?) of Alzi; it is
not quite clear whether this was an independent kingdom or part
of Suhmu (150).  The texts also mention several smaller "countries"
south of the Upper Euphrates valley (Daria, or Dirria, Urart. Dirgu;
Nirbu, Urart. Niriba, or Niribai-hube; Mallanu, Nirdun, etc.).
<p>
The Aramaic kingdom of Amed (Amida, modern Diyarbakir), with
its dynasty ("house") of Zamanu, was located in the upper reaches
of the Tigris. The kingdom of Shubria, with its Hurrian dynasty, was
situated farther to the northeast in the Sasun mountains. Separate
from it (apparently on the northern slopes of the Sasun mountains
in the direction of modern Mush) the Assyrian and Urartian sources
mention the country of Urumu (in Assyrian) or Urmie (in Urartian), which was probably a settlement of the Urumeans; this country is not to be identified with Arme, mentioned by the Urartian
inscriptions (cf. n. 151).
<p>
Further to the east the centers and tribal groups known to us
as far back as the 13th century B.C. are still mentioned up to the
end of the 10th century B.C.: the Uruatri, the Haphi, the Qumanians with their city of Qumme, etc. But in the course of the 9th and 8th centuries B.C. a new formation takes shape here: the kingdom of Hubushkia, or, as it was officially called, "the kingdom of
the Nairi," in the valley of the river Kentrites-Bohtan and spreathng
at times further to the east, towards the watershed of Lake Urmia.
By the 8th century in the valley of the Upper Zab there existed
the kingdom of Musasir (Urart. <i>Ardine</i>; possibly the same as the
 earlier Musru). In this valley there were rich temples: in Qumenu
(Qumme) (152)--the temple of the god Teisheba, and in Ardine--the
temple of Haldi (Khaldi), where the Urartian treasury was kept,
[77] although Musasir was not technically part of Urartu (153). The Hurro-
Urartian robber tribes of the Ukkians and others lived in the mountains surrounding Hubushkia and Musasir (154).
<p>
In the fertile valley near the eastern coast of Lake Van was founded
the kingdom or Urartu (Akkadian, Assyrian dialect, <i>Ur'artu</i>; Babylonian dialect, <i>Urashtu</i>, pronounced <i>Oralt</i>; biblical Ararat, the Urartian <i>Biainele</i>, probably pronounced <i>Vanele</i>, which, strictly speaking, means the "Biaian countries," whence the modern city 
name <i>Van</i>). The date of its foundation is not clear. In 859 B.C. the
Assyrian king Shalmaneser III was already fighting with its king
Aramu, but it is likely that Urartu as a state was formed earlier. It
is apparently mentioned as a kingdom in the later inscriptions of
Assurnasirapal II (884-859 B.C.); there is no way to decide whether
the "Uratru" of the inscription of the Assyrian king Adadnerari II
(911-890 B.C.) is the tribal federation of Uruatru or the kingdom
of Urartu (155).
<p><a name="3."></a>
It is difficult to say whether Gilzan, which may have been situated near the western bank of the Lake Urmia, was actually a kingdom, although Assyrian inscriptions of the 9th century B.C.
refer to its "kings" (156).  Later it seems to have become part of Urartu.
Mana (the Assyrians called it "The Land of the Manneans"), in the
hilly plain to the south of this lake, was undoubtedly a kingdom.
It was formed at the end of the 9th century on the Lullubian territory of the country of "Inner Zamua" as a result of the merger of many thriving city-states, which probably had existed there as
early as the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. (157) Possessing an archaic socio-political structure (autonomy of its individual districts, participation of a council of elders in the government) (158) Mana
nevertheless grew into a major force, which successively rivaled Urartu and Assyria, and was conquered only by Media at the end of the 7th-beginning of the 6th centuries B.C., almost simultaneously with these two empires (159). 
<p>
North of the center of the Urartian kingdom, including central
Transcaucasia, there do not seem to have existed states in the proper
sense of the word. The Urartian inscriptions refer to a great number of "countries" and tribes here, including the Etio (160), which apparently formed an extensive but loose tribal confederacy. All
of them dwelt mainly in the territory of the modern Armenian
Republic and the adjacent regions to the south of the Araxes. To
the west of them lived the tribes of Witeru, Lusha, Katarza,  Iya (Igane),
Zabahae, etc.(161) (on the upper reaches of the Araxes and Kur, and
around Lake Caldir). They may have been Georgian-speaking, just
as their neighbor Qulha (162). 
<p>
With respect to the ethnic affiliation of the other "countries"
[78] listed, we can say that part of them were Hurrian (Daiene, Shubria,
perhaps Gilzan and Mana), and part were Urartian (Urartu, Musasir).
In the valley of the Upper Euphrates and Lower Arsanias the population must have consisted of those Hurrian tribes which were linguistically closest to the Urartians; the population there was also
mixed with the Luwians and the new arrivals--the Mushki and the
Urumeans.

In my book, <i>In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith</i>, 
 I look at the 33 women who married the first Mormon prophet, taking them from birth to death. I started writing the book because I was fascinated by the puzzle of trying to work out their complex marriage histories (many married four or five times, sometimes with overlapping, polyandrous marriages), but I gradually became very caught up in the drama of their lives, and became deeply attached to them as real, living people.<p>

<b>ONLINE PUBLICATION:</b><br>
The FARMS Review of Books published two long reviews of my book, by Richard Lloyd Anderson, Scott Faulring and Danel Bachman, in which I was characterized as an atheist, a Fawn Brodie disciple , and a John C. Bennett figure. I wrote a long response to the reviews, and offered it to the editor of FARMS Review of Books if he wanted to publish it. He showed a marked lack of enthusiasm for doing this, so I decided to publish it in pamphlet form and online. Here it is:

<b>DESERT ISLAND BOOKS: MORMON HISTORY</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Brooks, Juanita: <i>The Mountain Meadows Massacre / John D. Lee: Zealot, Pioneer Builder, Scapegoat / On the Mormon Frontier: The Diary of Hosea Stout, 1844-1861 </i><br>
Brilliant revisionist history, and aesthetically a gripping tragedy. See Levi Peterson's biography of Brooks.<br>
<li>Leonard Arrington: <i>Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of Latter-Day Saints 1830-1900 / Brigham Young : American Moses / The Mormon Experience : A History of the Latter-Day Saints </i><br>
<i>Great Basin Kingdom</i> is another brilliant revisionist book, an economic retelling of LDS history. <i>Brigham Young</i> is a landmark of scholary biography, even if it underplays Brigham's limitations just a bit.

<li>Linda King Newell and Valeen Tippetts Avery: <i>Mormon Enigma: Emma Hales Smith </i><br>
<li>Roger Launius: <i>Joseph Smith III: Pragmatic Prophet </i><br>
It is a mistake to see LDS and RLDS history as distinct categories. 

<li>Samuel Taylor: <i>Family Kingdom </i> (1951, 2nd edition, revised, 1974 ) / <i>Taylor- Made Tales </i> / <i>Heaven Knows Why </i> <br>
	<i>Family Kingdom</i> is a fascinating, moving memoir of Samuel Taylor's father, John W. Taylor, the apostle who was excommunicated for post-Manifesto polygamy. Though Sam views him with enormous affection, and though he does not attack polygamy per se, problems in polygamy are implicitly reflected in this book. <i>Taylor-Made Tales</i> is a hilarious autobiography that ends with the writing of <i>Family Kingdom</i>.

<li>D. Michael Quinn: <i>The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power / The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power / J. Reuben Clark: The Church Years / The New Mormon History </i> (ed.)<br>
	There are many specific points in Quinn's books that can and should be debated, but his books nevertheless are groundbreaking in their willingness to look frankly at many specific "problems" in Mormon history. They raise the question: is "faith-promoting" history a kind of history that portrays church leaders as never making mistakes or going in wrong directions, or is "faith-promoting" history a kind of history that sees God working in subtle, sometimes indirect ways through church leaders who are real human beings, i.e., constantly making mistakes? <i>J. Reuben Clark</i> is in some ways Quinn's finest book, but the Hierarchy books are his magnum opus.

<li>Carmon Hardy: <i>Solemn Covenant: The Mormon Polygamous Passage </i><br>
	The tragic ordeal of post-Manifesto polygamy.  A fascinating, haunting narrative, and a thoughtful examination of the ethics and consequences of deciding to prevaricate for a perceived justified cause. See also Quinn's long article, "LDS Church Authority and New Plural Marriages, 1890-1904," <i>Dialogue</i> 18.1 (Spring 1985): 9-105.<br>

<li><i>The Best of Lowell L. Bennion: Selected Writings 1928-1988</i> (ed. Eugene England) / Mary Lythgoe Bradford, <i>Lowell L. Bennion: Teacher, Counselor, Humanitarian </i>. SLC: Dialogue Foundation, 1995.

<li>Patty Sessions, Diaries, as found in: Donna Smart, ed., <i>Mormon Midwife: The 1846-1888 Diaries of Patty Bartlett Sessions </i> 

<li>Wilford Woodruff Journal (ed. Scott Kenney)

<li>Annie Clark Tanner: <i>A Mormon Mother </i>

<li>Wallace Stegner: <i>The Gathering of Zion / Mormon Country </i>

<li>Snow, Eliza R.: Diaries and Memoir, see Maureen Ursenbach Beecher, ed., <i>The Personal Writings of Eliza Roxcy Snow</i>. SLC: University of Utah Press, 1995.

<li>Dean Jessee, ed. <i>The Papers of Joseph Smith </i>, 2 vols.

<li>Richard Bushman: <i>Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism </i><br>
	This scholarly, conservative biography dealt frankly with problem issues such as Joseph Smith and magic and date of Melchizedek Priesthood restoration. 

<li>Maureen Ursenbach Beecher and Lavina Fielding Anderson, eds., <i>Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective </i>
<li>Jill Mulvay Derr, Janath Russell Cannon and Maureen Ursenbach Beecher: <i>Women of Covenant: The Story of the Relief Society </i>
<li>Kenneth Godfrey, Audrey M. Godfrey and Jill Mulvay Derr: <i>Women's Voices: An Untold History of the Latter-day Saints 1830-1900 </i>. SLC: Deseret Book, 1982.
<li>Maxine Hanks, ed.: <i>Women and Authority </i>

<li>Stanley Kimball: <i>Heber C. Kimball: Mormon Patriarch and Pioneer </i>

<li>Gene Sessions: <i>Mormon Thunder: A Documentary History of Jedediah Morgan Grant </i><br>
Jedediah was my great great grandfather, believe it or not. I often wonder how our meeting on the other side of the veil will play out.

<li>Newell Bringhurst: <i>Brigham Young and the Expanding American Frontier </i>Very short, but very worthwhile. Particularly illuminating on Young's polygamy.

<li>Thomas Alexander: <i>Things In Heaven and In Earth: The Life and Times of Wilford Woodruff / Mormonism in Transition: A History of the Latter-day Saints, 1890-1930 </i>

<li>Edward Leo Lyman: <i>Political Deliverance: The Mormon Quest for Utah Statehood / San Bernardino: The Rise and Fall of a California Community </i>. SLC: Signature Books, 1996.

<li>Irene Bates and Gary Smith: <i>Lost Legacy: The Mormon Office of Presiding Patriarch </i><br>
	What you thought would be merely fascinating turns out to be very moving, as the last general patriarch ends his career. There is an intriguing Weberian analysis, too. As has been said elsewhere about another book, this is "a truly scholarly work that reaches the heart."

<li>Greg Prince: <i>Power From On High: The Development of Mormon Priesthood </i>

<li>Gary Bergera and Ron Priddis: <i>BYU: House of Faith </i><br>
An important analysis of the conflict of absolutism and liberalism in modern Mormonism.

<li>Richard Van Wagoner: <i>Mormon Polygamy / Sidney Rigdon: A Portrait of Religious Excess </i><br>

<li>Lawrence Foster: <i>Religion and Sexuality: Three American Communal Experiments of the Nineteenth Century </i><br>
Superb scholarly look at Mormon polygamy, viewing it in the context of the Shakers and the Oneida Community.

<li>Klaus Hansen: <i>Quest for Empire </i>

<li>Marvin Hill: <i>Quest for Refuge: The Mormon Flight from American Pluralism </i>

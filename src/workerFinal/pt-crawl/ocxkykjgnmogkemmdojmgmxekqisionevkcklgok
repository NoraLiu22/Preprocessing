The publication
primarily reports on papers from the <i><a href="https://journals.aps.org/">Physical Review</a></i>
journals, focusing on results that
will change the course of research, inspire a new way of thinking, or spark curiosity. The
stories behind these findings are written by experts, journalists, and our staff writers for
the benefit of the physics community and beyond.</p><p>The <i>Physical Review</i> provide no end of great stories.
But physics is more than papers, and we want the magazine to reflect the people, debates, and events
behind the reported research. <i>Physics Magazine</i> regularly includes interviews with physicists and news
stories on a variety of topics, as well as articles about the influence of physics on the
arts.</p><p>Here is an overview of what you'll find in <i>Physics Magazine</i>.</p></div><h4>Highlights of papers from the <i>Physical Review</i> journals</h4><ul class="no-bullet" style="margin-left: 2rem;"><li><b>Viewpoints</b> — Commentaries by experts that explain why a paper is important to the field</li><li><b>Focus stories</b> — Journalist-written news stories aimed at the broadest possible audience</li><li><b>Synopses</b> — Short summaries of newsworthy results written by journalists and <i>Physics Magazine</i> staff</li></ul><h4>Other articles</h4><ul class="no-bullet" style="margin-left: 2rem;"><li><b>Q&amp;As</b> — Interviews that delve into the questions that inspire physicists</li><li><b>Arts &amp; Culture</b> — Articles that explore the influence of physics on the arts</li><li><b>Trends</b> — Expert overviews of an emerging field and where it’s headed</li><li><b>News stories</b> about events, developments, and debates in the physics community</li></ul><hr class="wave" /><section><h2 id="editorialstaff">Editorial Team</h2><section><h3>Matteo Rini, Editor</h3><img alt="Photo of Matteo Rini." class="about-photo" src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/development/physics/images/MatteoFace2.jpg" /><p>Matteo Rini holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Pavia and a Ph.D. in physics from the Humboldt University of Berlin.

Papers must also be technically sound and have a clear element of novelty. Examples of suitable papers include experimental breakthroughs, theories that inspire a new perspective, applications-oriented research and physics of the everyday. The selection of papers is made in consultation with journal editors and outside experts.</p><p>Many excellent papers don't get covered in <i>Physics Magazine</i> because they would likely only be of interest to a narrow slice of the physics community.</p></section><section><h3>Can I submit an article to <i>Physics Magazine</i>?</h3><p>All of the articles in <i>Physics Magazine</i> are commissioned by the <i>Physics Magazine</i> editors; direct submissions are not accepted. However, suggestions for topics or events to cover can be submitted to <a href="mailto:physics@aps.org">physics@aps.org</a>.</p></section><section><h3>How do I comment on an article?</h3><p>Please send any comments to <a href="mailto:physics@aps.org">physics@aps.org</a>.</p></section><section><h3><i>Physics Magazine</i> is free, but what about the papers it covers?</h3><p>No journal subscription is needed to read <i>Physics Magazine</i>, but some of the papers covered by <i>Physics Magazine</i> articles can only be viewed with a journal subscription. All papers covered by a Viewpoint are made freely available from the "PDF (free)" link in the grey box at the top of the article. Papers covered in Focus stories and Synopses in general require a subscription, unless the papers are explicitly open-access.</p></section><section><h3>Can I reuse an image from <i>Physics Magazine</i>?</h3><p>Requests for permission to reuse an image from a <i>Physics Magazine</i> article should be directed to<a href="mailto:physics@aps.org"> physics@aps.org</a>.</p></section></section></article><div class="email-callout"><section class="column-row"><p>Sign up to receive weekly email alerts from <i>Physics Magazine</i>.</p><a class="small button" href="https://info.aps.org/physics-magazine"> Sign Up</a></section></div><script>window.apsMathJaxConfig = "https:";</script><footer><div class="upper-footer"><div class="column-row"><ul class="inline-list"><li><a href="http://www.aps.org"> APS</a></li><li><a href="/announcements" target="_self"> News and Announcements</a></li><li><a href="http://www.aps.org/membership/join.cfm"> Join APS</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact Us</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="lower-footer"><div class="column-row"><ul class="link-columns"><li><ul class="link-column"><li class="title">APS Journals</li><li><a href="https://journals.aps.org/about">About</a></li><li><a href="https://journals.aps.org/authors">Authors</a></li><li><a href="https://journals.aps.org/referees">Referees</a></li><li><a href="https://librarians.aps.org/institutional.html"> Subscriptions</a></li></ul></li><li><ul class="link-column"><li class="title">Students</li><li><a href="https://physics.aps.org/"> Physics</a></li><li><a href="http://www.physicscentral.com/"> PhysicsCentral</a></li><li><a href="http://www.aps.org/membership/student.cfm"> Student Membership</a></li></ul></li><li><ul class="link-column"><li class="title">APS Members</li><li><a href="http://www.aps.org/membership/aps-publications.cfm"> Subscriptions</a></li><li><a href="https://journals.aps.org/article-packs"> Article Packs</a></li><li><a href="http://www.aps.org/memb/"> Membership</a></li><li><a href="http://www.aps.org/membership/faq.cfm"> FAQ</a></li><li><a href="http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/index.cfm"> APS News</a></li><li><a href="http://www.aps.org/meetings/index.cfm"> Meetings &amp; Events</a></li></ul></li></ul><hr /><ul class="inline-list"><li><a href="http://www.aps.org/about/privacy.cfm"> Privacy</a></li><li><a href="https://journals.aps.org/policies"> Policies</a></li><li><a href="https://journals.aps.org/contact.html"> Contact Information</a></li><li><a href="mailto:feedback@aps.org"> Feedback</a></li></ul><p>Use of the American Physical Society websites and journals implies that the user has read and agrees to our <a href="https://journals.aps.org/info/terms.html"> Terms and Conditions</a> and any applicable Subscription Agreement.</p></div></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.aps.org/cookie-widget/latest/cookiewidget.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/libs/mathjax/2.7.2/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML,https:"></script><script src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/development/physics/javascripts/app-2a772ad2.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/development/physics/javascripts/citing_articles-e1848dc6.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/development/physics/javascripts/sharing-ac57fdad.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html> contentType 9 text/html url 33 https://physics.aps.org:443/about responseCode 3 200

One of the most important popularizes of rock and roll during the '50s, Alan Freed was the
first disc jockey and concert producer of rock and roll. Often credited with coining the
term rock and roll in 1951, ostensibly to avoid the stigma attached to R&amp;B and so
called race music, Freed opened the door to white acceptance of black music, eschewing
white cover versions in favor of the R&amp;B originals.<br>

<p>Albert James Freed was born December 15, 1922 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania of a Welsh
mother and Lithuanian born father. He was&nbsp;one of three sons of Maude and Charles
Freed, a clothing store salesman. In 1933 when Freed was twelve his family moved to Salem,
Ohio. He attended Salem High School during which time he formed a band known as the
Sultans of Swing, in which he played trombone. His ambition was to on day to become a
bandleader, but an ear infection ended that possibility. After he graduated from high
school in 1940, he enrolled at Ohio State University where he studied engineering for a
year.&nbsp; It was during this time that he&nbsp; developed an interest in radio </p>

<p>After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, Freed joined the US Army where he was assigned
to the Ski Patrol. It was at this time he developed a serious ear infection causing him to
receive his discharge.He then enrolled at Ohio State University where he earned a master's
degree. Returning to Salem he went work&nbsp;as a government inspector in military plants.
It was here he met his first wife Betty Lou Bean. They were married in 1942.</p>

<p>While at his government job, Freed enrolled in a night broadcasting class in
Youngstown, Ohio. After finishing he landed a jobs at&nbsp; number of small stations. His
first at&nbsp; WKST (1942) in New Castle, Pennsylvania where he played classical music for
$45 a week. Next was sportscasting at WKBN (1942) and WAKR (1945) where he became a local
favorite, playing hot jazz and pop recordings.&nbsp; Both of these stations were in Akron,
Ohio. In 1949 Freed&nbsp; landed a job and moved to WXEL-TV in Cleveland.</p>

<p>In 1950, Freed went to the management of WAKR requesting more money. When he didn't get
it he quit went to another Akron station WADC. Except Freed still was under contract to
WAKR. A law&nbsp; resulted that banned him from broadcasting within 75 miles of Akron for
one year suit. He then left Akron for Cleveland.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Freed took his Request Review to WXEL-TV where the show
bombed. However he stayed hosting a midday movie before he went to WJW where he did a
classical radio show and late night movie on their television station.</p>

<p>One night he was asked to fill in for a sick colleague and instead of but didn't stick
to the station's playlist the selection of records was suppose to play. Instead he played
the rhythm and blues records of Chess, Modern, King and Atlantic Records. The next day he
was fired. however, the station was bombarded with mail from listeners and Freed was
rehired.</p>

<p align="left">Leo Mintz who owned the Record Rendezvous a local record store saw an
increasing number of white teenagers buying rhythm and blues records at his store. Based
on these observations Mintz suggested to Freed he would sponsor his show if he would begin
playing these records. On July 11, 1951, at 11 PM signed off on his classical program.
Putting the needle down on Todd Rhodes's <em>Blues For A Moondog</em> calling himself
&quot;Moondog,&quot; Freed went on the air with his Moondog Rock and roll Party and became
among the first to program rhythm and blues for a white teenage audience. Within eighteen
months it was the number one radio show in Cleveland. Other small stations followed
eventually forcing the larger stations to join in.</p>

<p>Due to the prejudices of the times Freed began calling the rhythm and blues records he
played Rock &quot;n&quot; Roll. What is ironic that term Freed was using&nbsp; to make
rhythm and blues more acceptable to a white audience, was slang for sex in the black
community. </p>

<p>In 1951 a black vocal group The Dominoes recorded &quot;Sixty Minute Man&quot; which
was a (#1 R&amp;B and #17 pop) hit. The lyrics were highly suggestive and used rock and
roll in the lyrics. Freed began using the term a month later and most likely was inspired
by this song.</p>

<p>Freed would name his show <em>Moondog's Rock 'n' Roll Party</em>.&nbsp; The shows
success led&nbsp; to Freed's March 1952 Moondog Coronation Ball in Cleveland. Top black
acts were booked for the show. Six thousand fans crashed gates in addition to the
thousands already in 10,000 seat hall. Two thirds of the audience was white</p>

<p>Freed started his own record label Champagne Records and the first act signed were the
Crazy Sounds.&nbsp; Later he would changed their name to the Moonglows.&nbsp; Freed's
brother David had a small company called Lance Distribution, which specialized mostly
R&amp;B, handled the distribution end for Champagne.</p>

<p>In the early hours of a night in April 1953,&nbsp; while driving home from work, Freed
fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into a tree. The crash was heard at a near by police
statuin and when the police went to investigate they found Freed unconscious in the
wreckage. when his heart stopped beating and injection of adrenaline was injected. Freed
was seriously injured, with a punctured lung and damage to his spleen and liver. Skin on
his face was peeled away to which doctors had to replace it and sew it back across his
forehead. It took 260 stitches and extensive plastic surgery to get Freed's face somewhat
back to normal. the doctors would later tell him he was lucky to have survived.</p>

<p>Freed laid&nbsp; for weeks critically ill fighting for his life in the hospital. Once
off the critical list doctors to Freed that considering the extent and severity of his
injuries, not to expect to live more than another ten years and he could never have
another drink. Freed would outlive the ten year prediction but not by much. Freed would
not give up drinking.</p>

<p>In 1954 with Morris Levy as his manager, Freed moved his show to WINS radio in NY.
Within months the show was #1. Freed began staging revues at Brooklyn Paramount where he
often could be found on stage gyrating.&nbsp; Freed appeared in a number of rock and roll
movies such as&nbsp; <em>Don't Knock The Rock,&nbsp; Rock Around The Clock,</em> and&nbsp;
<em>Rock, Rock, Rock</em>. It was no surprise that these movies broadened the acceptance
of rock and roll. The real surprise was Alan Freed in the flesh. In his mid-thirties Freed
looked at least ten years older. Klutzy with little stage presence Freed&nbsp; looked
completely out of place. To many teens Freed looked like the ultimate adult.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Thomas Louis Hardin</strong><br>

&quot;He looked like Christ in Christ-like clothes&quot;<br>
Morris Levy</p>

<p>Upon Freed's move to New York, there was a controversy over his famous trademark,
Moondog. It concerned a street musician by the name of Thomas Louis&nbsp; Hardin who had
adopted the name Moondog. Hardin, a blind eccentric street musician, who dressed as a
Viking, sold umbrellas from a stand at the corner of 54th Street and Sixth Avenue.<em> </em>Hardin
didn't take kindly to Freed's using his &quot;monicker&quot; and filed a law suit for
$100,000 and asking the New York Supreme Court to issue a cease and desist order. The
facts he presented were he had been&nbsp; using the name Moondog since 1947, whereas Freed
didn't take it until 1951 with the clincher that Freed did not begin calling himself
&quot;Moondog&quot; had begun playing &quot;Moondog Symphony&quot; on his Cleveland radio
show. The composer of that song was none other than Thomas Louis &quot;Moondog&quot;
Hardin. Case closed.The judge ruled in favor of Hardin, ordered Freed to pay him
$5,700&nbsp; in damages, and stop using the name. Thereafter he called his show <em>Alan
Freed's Rock 'n' Roll Party.</em></p>

<p>The show was so popular that&nbsp; in two years Freed's salary went from from a base of
$15,000 plus twenty-five percent from his&nbsp;show's advertising monies to a yearly
income in excess of $750,000. By 1955, Freed was appearing in a number of rock and roll
films that cost a couple hundred dollars to make and grossed millions.</p>

<p>In 1957 ABC-TV gave Freed his own nationally-televised rock &amp; roll show, but an
episode on which Frankie Lymon danced with a white girl enraged thirteen ABC's Southern
affiliates and the show was cancelled. </p>

<p align="left">Freed's beginning of the end began when he put on a show at the Boston
Arena (1958).</p>

<font FACE="Calibri" SIZE="3"><span LANG>

<p>In Boston that Saturday night in May, 20 police were on hand for the 5,000 rock &#145;n
roll fans who jammed into the Arena.</p>

<p>The first half of the show went smoothly. But during the second half, police
interrupted the show several times, forcing Freed to quiet the audience. Jerry Lee Lewis
and his bands had the kids dancing in the aisles, but the police again forced Freed to
stop the show and make the audience sit down.</p>

<p>Then Chuck Berry came on stage to close the show. Again, the kids danced in the aisles.
Again, the police forced Freed to make them sit down. One of the police officers refused
to dim the houselights. Freed, frustrated, told the audience, &quot;It looks like the
police in Boston don&#146;t want you kids to have any fun.&quot;</p>

<p>At that point, fighting broke out and kids started throwing chairs at each other. Freed
got blamed for inciting the melee with his remarks, but the fight may have been a result
of gang rivalry. Berry hid behind the drummer to get as far away from the scuffle as
possible. The crowd then poured out into the streets.</p>

<p>What happened next is unclear. The newspapers reported stabbings, sluggings, robberies
and rapes. Jack Hooke, Berry&#146;s manager, remembers walking out of the Arena a half
hour after the show ended and seeing nobody.</p>

<p>The neighborhood surrounding the Arena was then a rough part of town with frequent
muggings. A lawyer for Alan Freed said the police simply took everything from the police
blotter in the precinct that night and blamed it on his client.</p>

<p>Only two people were arrested, and a news item about the riot described incidents far
from the Arena &#150; rock throwing at the Boston Garden and muggings in Roxbury and Back
Bay.</p>

<p>A few days after the concert, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted Alan Freed for
inciting a riot. Suffolk County District Attorney Gabriel Byrne justified the indictments.
He said the &#145;attitudes of the adults sponsoring the shows&#146; inspired the
&#145;juvenile outbreaks.&#146;</p>

<p></span></font>Though the charges were later dismissed for lack of evidence, but WINS
failed to renew Freed's contract. This incident forced him into into bankruptcy and would
just be the beginning of Freed's legal<font FACE="Calibri" SIZE="3"><span LANG></p>

<p>On Thursday, Alan Freed announced he was quitting WINS because the station didn&#146;t
stand behind him. </p>
</span></font>

<p><font FACE="Calibri" SIZE="3"><span LANG>This action took&nbsp; Freed&nbsp; by surprise
since his contract with the station gave it 25% of whatever his stage shows earned.
In&nbsp; fact Freed who&nbsp;considerd himself a &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot; for the
station was counting on the station paying for his defense.</span></font></p>

<p>Freed moved to WABC radio, and also hosted a locally televised dance show. ABC asked
Freed to sign an affadavit&nbsp; that he never received and money or gifts to promote
records. Freed refused and was fired.<br>
<br>
In 1959 the U.S. House Oversight Committee, at the urging of ASCAP, began to look into
deejays who took gifts from record companies in return for playing their records on their
shows. Though a number of deejays and program directors were caught in the scandal, the
committee decide to focus on Freed.&nbsp; Freed's broadcasts alliances quickly deserted
him. In 1959, WABC in New York asked him to sign a statement confirming that he had never
accepted payola. Freed refused &quot;on principle&quot; to sign and was fired.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="freed_fired.jpg" alt="alanfreedpayola.jpg (24768 bytes)" WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="247"></p>

<p align="left">Within the industry there was widespread belief that Fred was set up- that
the hearings were prompted by ASCAP, who represented the songwriters and publishers of pop
music, much which Freed refused to play.</p>

<p align="center">.<em> &quot;I never take a dime to plug a record. I'd be a fool to do
so; I'd be giving up control of my program.&quot;</em><br>
Alan Freed</p>

<p align="left">Unable to impose any formal punishment on Freed it wrote a bill that made
giving or receiving of payola a federal crime, punishable by up to two years in jail.</p>

<p>On Feb 8, 1960 a New York Grand Jury began looking into commercial bribery information
in the recording industry and on May 19, 1960 eight men&nbsp; were charged with receiving
$116,580 in illegal gratuities. This probe would lead to Freed being charged with income
tax evasion by the IRS.</p>

Michael Canning.</p>

<p>Freed wasn't the only deejay subpoenaed by the Oversight Committee and refused to
testify despite being given immunity.&nbsp; The trial began December, 1962 and ended with
Freed pleading&nbsp; guilty to two of the seven counts of commercial bribery receiving a
$300 fine and a six month suspended sentence. He was also accused of accepting more than
$30,000 in bribes from seven record companies and pleaded guilty to only accepting $2,000
from one and $700 from another.</p>

<p>Ironically, what ultimately sealed his fate were Freed&#146;s forthright itemized
admissions to the committee concerning payments he had accepted from distributors and
recording companies as a musical advisor. The fact that ABC had fired him for declining to
sign a humiliating all-encompassing oath denying participation in corrupt practices, while
not asking the same of the company&#146;s other contract employee, Dick Clark, only
deepened committee members&#146; and the press&#146; perception of Freed&#146;s
corruption. Less than a month after his testimony, the New York City police arrested the
disgraced DJ on charges of having pocketed payola amounting to $116,850.</p>

<p>In January 1963, he was arrested on a warrant charged that he hadn't paid the fine
imposed six months earlier. Though he only received a $300 fine and 6 months suspended
sentence his career would be over.</p>

<p>Bankrupt, despondent, and frequently drunk, Freed relocated to Palm Springs.</p>

<p>Forced to leave New York Freed work briefly at KDAY (owned by the same company that
owned WINS) in 1960, in Los Angeles, but when management refused to let him promote live
rock &amp; roll shows Freed left the station and returned to Manhattan to emcee a live
Twist revue. When the twist&nbsp; craze cooled he hooked on as a disc jockey at WQAM
(Miami, FL). Realizing that his dream of returning to New York radio was just that,
Freed's drinking increased. The Miami job lasted only two months. </p>

<p>Freed spent his last days alone, calling friends in the music business asking money for
rent and grocery bills.</p>

<p>March 15, 1964 Freed was indicted by a federal grand jury for tax evasion. The IRS
claimed that Freed owed $37,920 tax on unreported of $56,652 for the years 1957-59. Living
in Palm Springs, California at the time, Freed was poor, unemployed and unemployable.
Before he could answer the charges he entered a hospital suffering from uremia a condition
caused by the retention in the of body poisons normally expelled in urine. Alan Freed died
Jan 20, 1965 of cirrhosis, a penniless, broken man. He was 43.</p>

<p align="left">Freed truly loved rock and roll, claimed to have never have played a
record he didn't like and never forgot where the music came from. However, he was a flawed
man who claimed songwriting credits that weren't his, paid performers on his tours very
little and associated with questionable individuals.<br>

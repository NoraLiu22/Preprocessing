Kingdom</h2><blockquote>After the First Intermediate Period (2&nbsp;181&nbsp;BC to 2&nbsp;061&nbsp;BC, including the rules of the early members of the 11th Dynasty before Mentuhotep II) during which Egypt was governed by independent local rulers, the Middle Kingdom brought with it not only another period of central government but also a heyday of literature and an outstanding development of the individual. The most important wisdom and socio-critical texts date back to that period and show this newly discovered understanding which is also represented in statuary. <br /><br />Based on the portrayal of the respective ruler, people not only represent themselves with noticeably large ears, but also an almost pessimistic expression. The long coat, veiling the entire body, intensifies this effect. The repertoire of private statues has been expanded by the block statue, depicting a person sitting on the ground with his knees drawn to his body. Private statuary is not limited to the funerary context any longer but can now be found in the temples as well. Votive temple statues were supposed to make sure that the donor could take part in the temple rituals. </blockquote>Text above: &copy; Poster at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Eleventh Dynasty: 2&nbsp;134&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC<br /><br /></b>The Eleventh Dynasty of ancient Egypt (notated Dynasty XI) is a well attested group of rulers, whose earlier members before Mentuhotep II are grouped with the four preceding dynasties to form the First Intermediate Period, while the later members are considered part of the Middle Kingdom.

wig, and the   arms that cross over the chest, strictly limit the structure of the body to the essentials. The hands clenched in fists once held objects. The column-like subdivided legs show Antef slightly stepping forward, the oversized feet and the bulky base are only simply shown. <br /><br />The well-preserved painting shows black hair and red skin. The clothing  now shows only  bare limestone, but was originally painted white. The base and backposts are red with black   dots as an imitation of granite. The blue-painted hieroglyphs identify his brother Inherhotep and his sister Nachti, as well as denoting him as 'the honored one at Ptah-Sokaris-Intef, born of Sat-Mechit'.  <br /><br />Catalog: Painted limestone, Thebes,  ÄM 12485 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images36/img_2581stelaipepi.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/img_2581stelaipepism.jpg" alt = "img_2581stelaipepism" width="309" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Eleventh Dynasty: 2&nbsp;134&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Stela of Ipepi</b><br /><br />Ipepi is shown worshipping  Osiris.

The wesekh, or 'broad' collar conferred protection on the deceased, the terminals are often in the form of falcon heads. This was found in the tomb of  a female member of the court of King Mentuhotep II. <br /><br />This 'wesekh'  consists  of five rows of beads, two semicircular terminals and seven mummiform pendants, all of glazed composition. Four of the rows are of vertically strung cylindrical beads connected only at the ends. The longer beads are in the centre of the collar, the shorter ones at the sides. The top row is of white glazed composition, the second of bright-blue, the third of white and the outermost row of purplish glazed composition. The last colour, not common until the Eighteenth Dynasty is produced from manganese oxide. <br /><br />The fifth, topmost, row is composed of a single string of bright-blue and white cylinder beads strung lengthwise.

The seven bright-blue glazed composition mummiform pendants are attached to the bottom row of beads. The two bright-blue semicircular terminals are undecorated.

Artistic production had already begun to rediscover its fundamental rules under his predecessors, if at first mostly in the field of two-dimensional wall carvings. The newly regulated political and social structures are reflected in the definite structure and confident draughtsmanship of the reliefs on royal and private stelae. The dynamism inherent in this new beginning is apparent in the energetically powerful style of the reliefs from the funerary temple of Mentuhotep II, which also documents the sculptors reacquired technical perfection. The Munich fragments came from the chapel of Kemsit, one of six wives of Mentuhotep, who, in view of her facial features and curly hairstyle, probably came from Nubia in the south.    <br /><br /></blockquote>Text above: © Ägyptischen Museum München<br /><br /><p><a href="images42/mentuhotepandhathorrelief.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/mentuhotepandhathorreliefsm.jpg" alt = "mentuhotepandhathorreliefsm" width="900" height="356" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>	<b>Eleventh Dynasty: 2&nbsp;134&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Mentuhotep II<br /><br /></b>Relief of Mentuhotep II and the Goddess Hathor, circa 2&nbsp;010&nbsp;-&nbsp;2&nbsp;000&nbsp;BC.<br /><br />King Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II was revered by the Egyptians as the ruler who reunited Egypt after the era of disunity (the First Intermediate Period) that followed the end of the Old Kingdom.<br /><br />Descended from a family of Theban rulers, the king built his tomb and mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri in western Thebes. This relief was originally part of the decoration of the temple's main sanctuary that was added to the building at the end of the king's reign. The fine balance between figures and inscriptions on this block, as well as the clear outline and regular proportions of the king's image with its individualized facial features, exemplify the peak of a relief art that had developed over the decades while the vast temple complex was built and decorated.<br /><br />The figure of the goddess Hathor on the right of the block was chiselled away during the Amarna period, when King Akhenaten propagated the sole worship of the god Aten. Hathor was repaired in plaster in early Dynasty 19 and some of the paint on the whole block may also have been renewed at the time.<br /><br />Height 36 cm, width 98 cm. <br /><br />Catalog:  Limestone, paint,  Accession Number  07.230.2 <br />Photo:  Met Museum<br />Permission: <a href="images41/oa_openaccess.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/oa_openaccess.jpg" alt = "oa_openaccess" width="15" height="15"></a>&nbsp;Public Domain, Open Access<br />Source and text: Original, Met Museum</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images42/mentuhotepiitempledrawing.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/mentuhotepiitempledrawingsm.jpg" alt = "mentuhotepiitempledrawingsm" width="900" height="707" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>Reconstruction of Mentuhotep II's mortuary temple by Édouard Naville. The presence of a pyramid is debated.<br /><br />Mentuhotep II's most ambitious and innovative building project remains his large mortuary temple. The many architectural innovations of the temple mark a break with the Old Kingdom tradition of pyramid complexes and foreshadow the Temples of Millions of Years of the New Kingdom. As such, Mentuhotep II's temple was certainly a major source of inspiration for the nearby, but 550 year later temples of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III.<br /><br />However, the most profound innovations of Mentuhotep II's temple are not architectural but religious. First, it is the earliest mortuary temple where the king is not just the recipient of offerings but rather enacts ceremonies for the deities (in this case Amun-Ra).  Second, the temple identifies the king with Osiris. Indeed, the decoration and royal statuary of the temple emphasises the Osirian aspects of the dead ruler, an ideology apparent in the funerary statuary of many later pharaohs. <br /><br />Finally, most of the temple decoration is the work of local Theban artists. This is evidenced by the dominant artistic style of the temple which represents people with large lips and eyes and thin bodies. However  the refined chapels of Mentuhotep II's wives are certainly due to Memphite craftsmen who were heavily influenced by the standards and conventions of the Old Kingdom. This phenomenon of fragmentation of the artistic styles is observed throughout the First Intermediate Period and is a direct consequence of the political fragmentation of the country.<br /><br /> Photo: Édouard Naville<br /> Source: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Naville (1910)</span></a><br /> Permission: Public Domain <img src="images39/publicdomaintext.gif" alt = "publicdomaintext.gif" width="88" height="31"><br /> Proximate source and text: Wikipedia </p><br clear ="all"> <p><a href="images37/dsc09574relieffragment.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/dsc09574relieffragmentsm.jpg" alt = "Relief fragment" width="621" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Eleventh Dynasty: 2&nbsp;134&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Relief fragment from the mortuary temple of Pharaoh Mentuhotep II<br /><br /></b>In particular, it came from the Chapel of Kemsit, one of six wives of Mentuhotep, who, in view of her facial features and curly hairstyle shown here, probably came from Nubia in the south.<br /><br />Height: 370 mm,  Width: 335 mm<br /><br /> Middle Kingdom, 11th dynasty, around 2030 BC<br /><br /> Catalog: Limestone, Deir el-Bahari (Thebes West), ÄS 1621 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Ägyptischen Museum München<br />Text: © Ägyptischen Museum München<br />Additional text: http://www.leben-in-luxor.de/luxor_lexikon_museen_smaek2.html, http://www.mentuhotep.de/museen/muenchen/muenchen.htm</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images37/dsc09572fragment.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/dsc09572fragmentsm.jpg" alt = "Relief fragment " width="412" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<br /><b>Eleventh Dynasty: 2&nbsp;134&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Relief fragment from the mortuary temple of Pharaoh Mentuhotep II<br /><br /></b>In particular, it came from the Chapel of Kemsit, one of six wives of Mentuhotep, shown in the fragment further up this page.  <br /><br />	Middle Kingdom, 11th dynasty, around 2030 BC.<br /><br />Catalog: <br />Deir el-Bahari (Thebes West), Limestone,   ÄS 3390, Fragment with remnants of the title Mentuhotep Nebhepetres. <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Ägyptischen Museum München<br />Text: © Ägyptischen Museum München<br />Additional text: http://www.leben-in-luxor.de/luxor_lexikon_museen_smaek2.html, http://www.mentuhotep.de/museen/muenchen/muenchen.htm</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images37/dsc09573fragment.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/dsc09573fragmentsm.jpg" alt = "Relief fragment " width="412" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images37/img_6190relief2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/img_6190relief2sm.jpg" alt = "Relief fragment " width="328" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p>	<br /><b>Eleventh Dynasty: 2&nbsp;134&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Relief fragment from the mortuary temple of Pharaoh Mentuhotep II<br /><br /></b>In particular, it came from the Chapel of Kemsit, one of six wives of Mentuhotep, shown in the fragment further up this page.  <br /><br />	Middle Kingdom, 11th dynasty, around 2030 BC.<br /><br />Catalog: <br />Deir el-Bahari (Thebes West),  Sandstone, ÄS 1617<br />Height: 11.5 cm.

For blue and yellow, it used the proper names of the minerals of the same colour, lapis lazuli and orpiment. (Orpiment is a lemon-yellow to golden or brownish yellow orange-yellow arsenic sulphide mineral). <br /><br />They did not have any words for brown, pink, grey and orange. This does not mean, however, that the Egyptians had a more primitive perception or conception of colours than we have today. It merely proves that what anthropological studies have recently been able to show also applies to Ancient Egypt: early cultures first and accordingly primarily had designations such as light and dark, dry and wet, fresh and old or even smooth and rough as quality characteristics of objects. Only later did they develop their own words for their colourfulness.<br /><br /> Against this background, it is not at all surprising that the Egyptian words for the colours black, white, red and green are also synonyms for dark, light, fiery and fresh. Black was the most important colour in Egypt. The country on the Nile was named after it: Kemet, "The Black". The name was derived from the fertile Nile mud, which for thousands of years was deposited in metre-thick layers in the plain between the desert elevations on both sides of the Nile every year after the summer flooding of the entire river bed. <br /><br />  Thus, black in Egypt was occupied with the most pleasant associations that the country could possibly muster. The Egyptians proudly called themselves "The People of the Black (Land)". In Coptic, the most recent stage of the ancient Egyptian language, the country's name was pronounced Keeme or Cheemi, which has even found its way into our language because of a book of wisdom called 'The Egyptian', which is pronounced similarly: The German word  'Chemie' or chemistry,  originally meant nothing more than 'The (ancient) Egyptian wisdom / science'. <br /><br /> If in Ancient Egypt black was endowed with a decidedly positive symbolism, what then took the position of our 'black' with its negative associations? It was the colour red. It was used to designate the desert areas bordered by the fertile, black fields of the Nile plain. The latter was the habitable Egypt, while the desert was the inhospitable, barren expanse where no Egyptian wanted to live. It was the countryside inhabited by predatory Bedouins, i.e. the direct contrast to the native Kemet/Egypt. <br /><br />Anyone who has ever seen the deserts of Egypt, either the flat Libyan Desert to the west of the Nile or the Arabian Desert to the east of it, will certainly be able to relate to the designation 'red' for the desert as being particularly characteristic. Incidentally, it is the latter, the Eastern Desert of Egypt, which dominates the entire region with mountains up to 2000 m high, that has also given its name to the sea bordering it: 'Red Sea' is short for 'The Sea of the Red (Land)'. <br /><br />Recently, it has even been suggested that the Indo-European word red (red, rouge) was derived directly from the ancient Egyptian root Rudsch (to be firm/strong) as it occurs in the term "firm/red ore" (Coptic: Ba-Rot). According to this, not only the ancient Egyptian word for 'black' - via a certain diversion  into 'chemistry' - but  also an ancient Egyptian designation for 'red' - even quite directly and without detours - would have found its way into the modern European languages! <br /><br />The negative colour red was also associated with the evil god Seth, Lord of the Deserts. He was the brother and murderer of the  good god Osiris, the ruler of Egypt and the realm of the dead, whose characteristic colour was black for these two reasons. <br /><br /></blockquote>Text above:   Museum August Kestner, Hannover<br /><br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br /><b>The Twelfth Dynasty <br /><br /></b>  The time of this  dynasty's rule   has been characterised as 'the happiest age of Egyptian history'  The second phase of Egyptian civilisation now set in,  a phase which is regarded by many as outshining the glories of the first.  The first civilisation had subordinated the people to the monarch, and had aimed especially at preserving the memory and setting forth the power and greatness of king after king.<br /><br />  The second had the benefit and advantage of the people for its primary object.  It was utilitarian, beneficent, appealing less to the eye than to the mind, farsighted in its aims, and most successful in the results which it effected. The wise rulers of the time devoted their energies and their resources, not, as the earlier kings, to piling up undying memorials of themselves in the shape of monuments that 'reached to heaven',  but to useful works, to the excavation of wells and reservoirs, the making of roads, the encouragement of commerce, and the development of the vast agricultural wealth of the country. They also diligently guarded the frontiers, chastised aggressive tribes, and checked invasion by the establishment of strong fortresses in positions of importance.<br /><br />They patronised art, employing themselves in building temples rather than tombs, and adorned their temples not only with reliefs and statues, but also with the novel architectural embellishment of the obelisk, a delicate form, and one especially suited to the country.<br /><br />The founder of the Twelfth dynasty,  Amenemhat I, deserves a few words of description. He found Thebes in a state of anarchy.  Civil war raged on every side, and  all the traditions of the past were forgotten.  Noble fought against noble,  the poor were oppressed,  life and property were alike insecure. There was stability of fortune neither for the ignorant nor for the learned man.  One night, after Amenemhat I had lain down to sleep, he found himself attacked in his bedchamber.  The clang of arms sounded near at hand. Starting from his couch, he seized his own weapons and struck out,  when lo! his assailants fled.  Detected in their attempt to assassinate him, they dared not offer any resistance, thus showing themselves alike treacherous and cowardly. <br /><br /><br /><br />Amenemhat, having once taken arms, did not lay them down till he had defeated every rival, and so fought his way to the crown. Once acknowledged as king, he ruled with moderation and equity; he  'gave to the humble, and made the weak to live',  he 'caused the afflicted to cease from their afflictions, and their cries to be heard no more',  he brought it to pass that none hungered or thirsted in the land,  he gave such orders to his servants as continually increased the love of his people towards him.<br /><br />At the same time, he was an energetic warrior. He 'stood on the boundaries of the land, to keep watch on its borders', personally leading his soldiers to battle, armed with the khopesh (an Egyptian sickle-shaped sword). He carried on wars with the Petti, or bowmen of the Libyan interior, with the Sakti or Asiatics, with the Maxyes or Mazyes of the north-west, and with the Ua-uat and other dark skinned tribes of the south; not, however, as it would seem, with any desire of making conquests, but simply for the protection of his own frontier. With the same object he constructed on his north-eastern frontier a wall or fortress 'to keep out the Sakti',  who continually harassed the people of the Eastern Delta by their incursions. <br /><br />The wars of Amenemhat I. make it evident that by his time Thebes had advanced from the position of a petty kingdom situated in a remote part of Egypt, and held in check by two or more rival kingdoms in the lower Nile valley and the Delta, to that of a power which bore sway over the whole land from Elephantine to the Mediterranean. 'I sent my messengers up to Abu (Elephantine) and my couriers down to Athu' (the coastal lakes), says the monarch in his 'Instructions' to his son — the earliest literary production from a royal pen that has come down to our days; and there is no reason to doubt the truth of his statement. In the Delta alone could he come into contact with either the Mazyes or the Sakti, and a king of Thebes could not hold the Delta without being master also of the lower Nile valley from Coptos to Memphis. We must regard Egypt, then, under the 'twelfth dynasty' as once more consolidated into a single state — a state ruled, however, not from Memphis, but from Thebes, a decidedly inferior position.<br

Tanis.<br /><br />This is one of the largest sphinxes outside of Egypt. It was found in 1825 among the ruins of the Temple of Amun at Tanis (the capital of Egypt during the 21st and 22nd dynasties). This impressive stone sculpture with its precise details and polished surfaces is a work of admirable craftsmanship. The recumbent lion, with tense body and outstretched claws, gives the impression of being ready to leap. <br /><br />The shen hieroglyph sculpted on the plinth under each paw evokes a cartouche, confirming the royal nature of the monument. Modifications The legible inscriptions are all 'usurpations', i.e. traces of subsequent modifications to the monument. The names of Merneptah (19th Dynasty) and Sheshonq (22nd Dynasty) are legible. The original texts (traces of which are still visible in places) were deliberately erased and replaced. It is therefore impossible to date this statue with certainty, especially as the face does not resemble any known, well-documented royal portrait. In view of this uncertainty, Egyptologists are divided: some date the sphinx to the 12th Dynasty, others to the 6th or even the 4th.	<br /><br />	Catalog:  Granite,  A 23, Sully, Entresol, Crypte du sphinx, Salle 338 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source and text: Original, Musée du Louvre<br />Additional text: http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <p><a href="images41/DSC01589poster.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/DSC01589postersm.jpg" alt = "DSC01589postersm" width="505" height="1000" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Abydos</b><br /><br />Abydos was the main cult centre of the god Osiris. As a result, many officials of the Middle Kingdom erected mud-brick chapels there, in an area known as the Terrace of the Great God. This was close to the route of the procession at the annual festival of Osiris, when episodes from the story of the god's murder and resurrection were re-enacted.<br /><br />The chapels at Abydos contained stone stelae and statues set in niches. These commemorated the dedicator and his relatives or associates, allowing their spirits to receive nourishment from the offerings made at the festival.<br /><br />In this way chapels, stelae, statues and dummy tombs fulfilled the same life-renewing role for the spirits of the deceased as the tomb. <br /><br />Source: Poster, British Museum<br />Text:  Poster at the British Museum, <!-- https://www.britishmuseum.org/,-->  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images44/DSC02512gold_amulet.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images44/DSC02512gold_amuletsm.jpg" alt = "DSC02512gold_amuletsm" width="400" height="941" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /> <b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Gold Amulet <br /><br /></b>Gold amulet, very fine.

Some 230 of these curved objects, usually made of highly polished hippopotamus ivory and resembling the shape of tusks, are known. Though many are worn from use, it is clear that most were incised with depictions of demons wielding knives. Some Egyptologists believe the ancient Egyptians imagined the wands themselves as magic knives. High-status Egyptians who could afford them wielded these powerful instruments against supernatural forces by calling upon the power of the demons to ward off evil. It is possible the Egyptians of the Middle Kingdom developed these wands as a response to the period of religious and ideological uncertainty that followed the collapse of the Old Kingdom  (circa 2&nbsp;649&nbsp;BC&nbsp;–&nbsp;2&nbsp;150&nbsp;BC). With the memory that traditional centres of power and religion had been in disarray, perhaps these wands gave some high-ranking Egyptians the confidence to tap into the power of demons and keep the forces of chaos at bay.<br /><br />Egyptologist Frank Vink notes that some Middle Kingdom spells intended to be recited during pregnancy and throughout early childhood include a word that scholars interpret as 'amulet.' Perhaps, Vink suggests, magic wands were the amulets being cited in these spells. Tauret, the powerful hippopotamus goddess, was associated with childbirth, and the fact that most of the wands were made from hippopotamus tusks might link them to her special role as the protector of mothers and young children. One example of a Middle Kingdom magic wand has a cord still attached to it that could be worn around the neck. It’s possible that mothers and children alike wore these objects as amulets to call upon knife-wielding demons to protect them during the most vulnerable periods of their lives, and these magic wands are also called amuletic wands. <br /><br />Catalog: Thebes,  EA18175<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  www.britishmuseum.org/research/ and card at the Museum, &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 <br /> Additional text:  www.archaeology.org  </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <p><a href="images44/DSC02133magicwandbroken.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images44/DSC02133magicwandbrokensm.jpg" alt = "DSC02133magicwandbrokensm" width="950" height="422" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>  </p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p><b>Date uncertain: 2&nbsp;033&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;710&nbsp;BC  (Middle Kingdom)<br /><br />    Magic Wand <br /><br /></b> Length  370 mm.<br /><br /> Amuletic wand in  hippopotamus ivory with  incised detail.

It is used extensively throughout this funerary equipment. Unlike other outer coffins, where the decoration is usually juxtaposed with the plain wood, the exterior of the Sebekhetepi's coffin is painted yellow. In ancient Egypt yellow was associated with the sun, and a substitute for gold. </p><br clear ="all"><p>The main features of the external decoration are the border in red, blue-green and white, and the wedjat eyes. These eyes were placed on one of the long sides of the coffin, which would have faced east. This was so that the deceased, placed on his side within the coffin, could watch the sun rise. The inscriptions are in pale blue, a colour often chosen for hieroglyphs, against a white background. They consist of the request for offerings from the funerary gods Osiris and Anubis, typical of the coffins of the Middle Kingdom (about 2040 BC - 1750 BC). <br /><br />Catalog: 41571<br />Photo: &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: &copy; https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/outer-coffin-of-sebekhetepi/cAF-9XfxmLucxg?hl=en</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images34/endcoffinsebek.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images34/endcoffinsebeksm.jpg" alt = "sebekhetepi outer coffin" width="300" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images40/dsc00407coffin.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/dsc00407coffinsm.jpg" alt = "dsc00407coffinsm" width="299" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p><a href="images40/dsc00408coffintop.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/dsc00408coffintopsm.jpg" alt = "dsc00408coffintopsm" width="366" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> </p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p> <b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Outer coffin of Sebekhetepi<br /><br /></b>The decoration of the interior is also austere.

The inscriptions running down the centre of the lid and around the top of the case are written in blue on a white band. The edges of the lid and corners of the case are decorated with long striped bands separated by perpendicular short bands in the same colours. The large wedjat eyes on one side are similarly in blue against a white background, surrounded by a multicoloured border. These enabled the mummy, placed on its side so it faces the wedjat eyes, to see out of the coffin. The inside of the coffin is decorated with representations of offerings.<br /><br />Catalog: EA41572<br /><!-- Photo: &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /> -->Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: &copy;  https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/outer-coffin-of-sebekhetepi/cAF-9XfxmLucxg?hl=en</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p>	<a href="images40/dsc00428sandals.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/dsc00428sandalssm.jpg" alt = "sebekhetepi sandals" width="394" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "25"></a><!-- <a href="images34/img_0240sandals.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images34/img_0240sandalssm.jpg" alt = "sebekhetepi sandals" width="282" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "25"></a><a href="images34/sandalssebekhetepiggle.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images34/sandalssebekhetepigglesm.jpg" alt = "sebekhetepi sandals" width="425" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "25"></a> --><br /> <b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Sandals of Sebekhetepi<br /><br /></b>These sandals,  253 mm long,  were found lying on the lid of the inner coffin, above the feet of the corpse.

In many tombs, two boats were provided, equipped in the manner of Nile river craft when travelling north or south. Hence one is represented propelled by oars alone, for journeys downstream, the other with the sail set, to catch the northerly winds when travelling upstream. </p><br clear ="all"><p>When found, the mast, sail and rigging were folded down. Under a canopy, on the roof of which are painted depictions of shields, sits the owner with two boxes or storage chests. At the stern sits the helmsman who originally operated the tiller (lost), attached to the steering oar. In the bows stands the pilot. Three of the crew are hauling on the rigging, while two others are depicted using poles (lost), as if levering the boat off a sandbank - a regular obstacle to navigation on the Nile. <br /><br />Wooden model of sailing-boat: the hull is rather narrow, with moderate sheer; bow lower and more narrow than stern, which has notch for steering-oar; exterior devoid of paint. Deck flush and not cambered, so that raised gunwales are absent; painted white with deck-plan and outer edges in red. The painted centre-strip runs the full length of the vessel; the fore-deck is marked only by a normal painted thwart, but the after-deck is marked by an exceptionally broad painted band. There are seven white rectangles on each side; the midships pair are separated by the usual mast-space. The point of the fore-deck is painted black.<br /><br /> In the after part of the vessel is an open-sided cabin, consisting of a rounded top supported on either side by four posts, the latter strengthened each side with a single cross-piece tied to them about half-way up. The rounded roof is yellow edged with black to represent leather strips which have white markings edged with black to indicate the lashings which hold them in place; the roof of the cabin is also decorated on each side with two paintings of round-topped shields, alternately white with black markings and black with white markings. The cabin is open to the stern. Immediately abaft the cabin stands a steering-post which has been trimmed roughly to an octagonal section but has no groove on top. To it was lashed the butt of the steering-oar, which was also lashed to the notch on the stern; the present lashings are modern. <br /><br />  The tiller was broken off, only the stump remaining. In the bows stands the pilot with right arm extended and left hanging down. Between mast and cabin stand three sailors hauling on the rigging, while forward of the mast are two other members of the crew facing aft and heaving on quant-poles as if to push the boat off a sandbank; they are leaning forward with almost straight bodies, one arm and shoulder pressing on the quants while their disengaged arms are supposed to be pressing on the deck to obtain greater leverage; actually the hands do not quite touch the deck. <br /><br />  The human figures on board have red bodies, white skirts, and short black wigs; it is noticeable that both the men working the rigging and those pushing on the quants have their legs well separated so as to get a good purchase on the deck. The helmsman sits in the stern, left arm at 45 degree with the body, right arm straight in front to grasp the tiller, which is missing; the stump is sticking out of the hole in the shaft of the steering-oar.<br /><br />   In the cabin squats the figure of the owner of the boat; he has his right arm forward at an angle of about 45 degrees and his left arm slightly forward. Behind him are two round-topped travelling trunks placed one on top of the other and painted red and yellow. All the standing sailors except the pilot, as well as the owner, still have the remains of the original fabric skirts. No facial features carved except noses; eyes are painted on. Arms are pegged to shoulders and cut off straight at ends; hands are not shaped.<br /><br />  Height  530 mm, length 698 mm, length  870 mm, depth 310 mm (the BM gives two lengths for the boat) <br /><br />As received by the Museum the mast and rigging were in disorder, but photographs taken by the excavator on the site show that the mast, yards and rigging, and the rolled-up sail originally rested in part on the cabin top and in part on the figures of the crew. The spars are slight twigs with much of the original bark and the minimum of trimming, and the same comment applies to two quant-poles on which men are shown as pushing; these were 'in situ' when the boat was found.<br /><br />The boat comes from the tomb of Sobkhetepi (no. 723), and was found lying on top of the outer wooden coffin, together with a second boat, a model granary, a model of brewing, baking and butchering, and a wooden figure of a serving-girl with a basket on her head (not in the collection).<br /><br />Catalog: EA41574<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card  at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images40/dsc00412rowboat.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/dsc00412rowboatsm.jpg" alt = "Hetepnebi" width="478" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /> <b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Row boat of Sebekhetepi</b><br /><br />Painted wooden model of a boat propelled by oars.

When found, this boat, like its companion, was provided with a mast, sail and rigging, which have not survived. </p><br clear ="all"><p>Wooden model boat under oars.  The solid hull has a slight sheer sloping sharply up to the stern, which has a small block notched for a steering-oar.  Gunwales, thwarts, and the central deck-strip are painted in red on a white deck, with seven white rectangles on each side and a small mast-space. <br /><br />The point of the  fore-deck is painted black, the exterior of the hull in white. A steering-oar with tiller and steering-post were present originally. The oar was secured to the notch in the stern but not to the steering-post. <br /><br />Four oars belonging to this boat were found in the tomb; only one was found actually in place, in the hands of the third rower from forward on the starboard side, but the excavator replaced the three loose oars in the hands of the other starboard rowers. <br /><br />The pilot is seated in the bows facing forward with right arm extended at an angle of about 40 degrees, as if using a sounding-pole (<i>&#8239;or a quant for poling&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>), and the left arm is hanging down.<br /><br />There are four pairs of rowers amidships. The helmsman is aft in the same attitude as the pilot. Owing to the fact that the steering-oar was not secured to the steering-post as it should have been, the helmsman did not in fact hold the tiller as his attitude suggests.<br /><br />The bodies of the crew are red, their features are roughly indicated and the eyes are painted on in white and black, the wigs are black, and the skirts white. All the crew except the helmsman when found still had fabric skirts as well. The arms and hands of crew are represented by straight bars of wood pierced with holes to take the butts of oars, and are pegged and glued (?) to the shoulders. Skirts and legs are represented by solid blocks carved in one piece as trunks and are painted white.<br /><br />This boat had suffered losses before reaching the Museum. Photographs taken 'in situ' show that originally the mast, yards, rigging, and furled sail were laid horizontally on the shoulders of the rowers and the spars are thin twigs with much of their original bark.<br /><br />Catalog: EA41575 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card  at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images40/dsc00415granary.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/dsc00415granarysm.jpg" alt = "Hetepnebi" width="383" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /> <b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Granary of Sebekhetepi</b><br /><br />Wooden funerary model of a granary, made of painted wood and grain, comprising a granary and five figures, from the tomb of the official Sebekhotep.

His head is shaven and he is dressed in a long wraparound garment. He stands in a pose of prayer with his arms hanging down, the hands resting flat on the front of his robe. Inscriptions on the robe and on three sides of the back pillar contain offering prayers and autobiographical information.<br /><br />Height: 195 mm.<br /><br /></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>Curator's comments:<br /><br />The inscriptions on the figure are unusually extensive. There are three columns of hieroglyphs on the man’s garment, and four more columns on three sides of the back pillar. Their content accounts for the statue’s exceptional importance, as they reveal the owner’s extraordinary career.<br /><br />On the cloak he is identified as ‘the senior lector in the King’s House, master of secrets in the August Chamber, pure of hands in performing rituals, the lector Nebhepetra, born of Sitamun.’ The man’s name is unusual and recalls the throne name of Nebhepetra Montuhotep II, a pharaoh who had lived some 250 years earlier and founded the Middle Kingdom. His magnificent mortuary temple left an enduring stamp on the cityscape of ancient Thebes, and later generations of locals invoked the king in prayers as though he were a god. People named after the king often belonged to families of priests who served in Montuhotep’s temple, and the owner of this statue was probably no exception. Indeed he is almost certainly identical with a ‘senior lector’ Nebhepetra who left graffiti in the cliffs rising up around the temple.<br /><br />The statue’s significance stems in large part from what the texts communicate about the social roles of its subject and his connections to the king. Lectors were leading intellectuals with knowledge of rituals and sacred texts. These religious scholars were well versed in the rules that governed formal art, iconography and hieroglyphic writing – the script employed on official monuments and objects. Apart from their priestly duties, they directed the content and design of wall images in temples and tombs, and many lectors even doubled as draughtsmen. Nebhepetra states explicitly that he was a senior lector ‘in the King’s House’. His easy access to the currently ruling pharaoh leaves no doubt that he fulfilled an advisory role in the execution of decoration programmes commissioned by the king for sacred buildings. The palace (‘King’s House’) our priest frequented for conversations with the king was probably one that stood in Thebes.<br /><br />The back pillar of the statue contains an autobiographical statement of particular significance, revealing that Nebhepetra was also a ‘Medjau’ in the temple of Amun-Ra in Karnak. The Medjau were desert police, whose duties encompassed the security of desert roads and wealthy institutions such as temples and cemeteries, which in Egypt were often located on the desert edge. References to the Medjau are extremely rare in sources as ancient as this statue, and it provides new evidence for the shifting meaning of ethnic and professional designations. Originally the Medjau were a Nubian nomadic people, often recruited by the Egyptians to patrol the deserts. The statue shows that already in the 19th century BC, much earlier than previously thought, the term Medjau had become a general term for desert police, including Egyptians. Nebhepetra was clearly an Egyptian, not a Medjau who assumed an Egyptian name: no Nubian nomads would have had access to his high status and literacy, nor would they have taken an interest in the local cult of a long-dead Egyptian king.<br /><br />Against tradition, the sides of the back pillar are also inscribed, bearing invocations of Osiris and the war god ‘Montu, lord of Medamud’. The town of Medamud lies just north of Karnak, at the northern limits of ancient Thebes. The mention of Montu on the statue of a Theban priest suggests that Nebhepetra’s duties stretched beyond the centre of Thebes – and probably well beyond. Nebhepetra therefore provides us with the expansive story of a priest and policeman whose radius of action comprised the royal palace in Thebes, the local temple of a deified king, the temple of Amun-Ra in Karnak, and the neighbouring provincial town of Medamud.<br /><br />Catalog: Serpentine, Western Thebes,     EA83921<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum,   https://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images42/DSC01625amenhotep.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/DSC01625amenhotepsm.jpg" alt = "DSC01625amenhotepsm" width="249" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />The Priest Amenhotep</b><br /><br /> Limestone statuette of the priest Amenhotep,  circa 1&nbsp;985&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;773&nbsp;BC<br /><br />The inscription on the plinth is, unusually, written in hieratic script in ink.

Four oarsmen drive the ship forward; in the stern stands the helmsman (missing the now lost rudder); in the bow the pilot who has to watch out for sandbanks, dangerous water animals and oncoming traffic. <br /><br />In terms of form history, the model represents an interesting type. Just as  railway carriages were initially designed like horse carriages and the first steamboats still had many elements of sailboats, the hull and stem of these ships - naturally made of wood - are stylised after the model of early historical papyrus barges, i.e. old forms are converted into a different material. This is the only way to explain the mast - it would not have had any support in a boat of this format that was actually tied together from papyrus stalks. <br /><br /> So, as vividly as an aspect of daily life in Egypt becomes to us here, the function of the model is exclusively otherworldly. The 'lord' wanted to have the many goods and comforts of his earthly existence also  at his disposal in the afterlife. In 'reality', the journey to Buto (where the deified lower Egyptian kings of prehistoric times rested) or to Abydos, the tomb and main cult site of Osiris, has become a journey for both pleasure and work. <br /><br />The custom of giving the dead (rarely stone, mostly wooden) models developed in the late Old Kingdom and lasted until the 12th Dynasty. Often these are not only single figures,  but groups of figures, which were arranged into regular scenes (workshops, farming, even herds of cattle and military units) which can then replace the pictures on the tomb walls. <br /><br />The importance of these compositions in art history lies in their breaking with the classical canon and its strict rules, which sought to avoid the impression of spatial depth, laterality and dynamism and largely prevented the emergence of genuine group statues.  <br /><br />  Length  580 mm<br /><br /><!-- Bootsmodellwohl aus Mittelagypten12. Dynastie, etwa 2000 bis 900 v. Chr. Holz mit BemalungL. 580 mmInv. Nr. 1960.28Das Modell stammt zwar aus dem Grabbereich (s.u.) spiegelt aber aber ein Bild, wie es sich dem Agypter taglich in zahlreichen Beispielen und Varianten auf dem Deck kauernd, läßt sich zu einem Besuch, zur Inspektion seiner Güter oder zu einem Amtsgeschäft fahren. die Reise mag mehrere Tage dauern, denn er führt eine Truhe, wahrscheinlich für Kleidung und Toilettenartikel, mit sich. Vier Ruderer treiben das Schiff voran; im Heck steht der Steuermann (mit dem heute verlorenen Steurruder), im Bug der Pilot der auf Sandbänke, gefährliche Wassertiere und den Gegenverkehr zu achten hat. Formengeschichtlich vertritt das Modell einen interessant Typ. So wie die Eisenbahnwagen anfänglich noch als Kutschen gestaltet und die ersten Dampfboote noch viele Elemente von Seglern aufwiesen, sind bei diesen - naturlich aus Holz gezimmerten - Schiffen Rumpf und Steven nach dem Vorbild frühgeschichtlicher Papyrus - Nachen stilisiert, alte Formen also in ein anderes Material umgesetzt. Nur so erklärt sich auch der Mast - in einem wirklich aus Papyrusstengeln zusammengebundenen Boot dieses Formats hätte er keinen Halt gehabt. So lebendig uns also hier ein Aspekt des täglichen Lebens in Ägypten wird - die Funktion des Modells ist ausschließlich jenseits-bezogen. Der 'Herr' wollte auch im nachtodlichen dasein über möglichst viele Güter und Fähigkeiten seiner irdischen Existenz verfügen. Aus der diesseitigen Vergnügungs- oder Arbeitsreise ist in 'Wirklichkeit' die Fahrt nach Buto (wo die vergöttlichten  unterägyptischen Könige der Vorzeit ruhten) oder nach Abydos zur Grab- und Hauptkultstätte des Osiris geworden. Der brauch, dem Toten (seltener steinerne, meistens hölzerne) Modelle mitzugeben, entwickelte sich im ausgehenden Alten Reich und hat sich bis in die 12. Dynastie gehalten. Häufig handelt es sich nicht nur um einzelne Figuren (wie Nr. 7) sondern um Figuren-gruppen, die zu regelrechten Szenen (Werkstätten, Ackerbebauung, sogar Viehherden und militärisch Einheiten) zusammengestellt sind und dann die Bilder an den Grabwänden ersetzen können. Die kunstgeschichtliche Bedeutung dieser Kompositionen liegt in der Durch brechung des klassischen Kanons und seiner strengen  Regeln, die den Eindruck von Raumtiefe, Seitlichkeit und Dynamik zu vermeiden trachten und die Entstehung echter Gruppenstatuen weitgehend verhindert haben. -->Catalog: Painted wood,  probably from Middle Egypt,  Inv. nr. 1960.28 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source and text: Original,  Museum August Kestner, Hannover<br />Additional text: Paper Catalogue, Museum August Kestner, Hannover, Wikipedia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images44/DSC06431giftbringergirl.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images44/DSC06431giftbringergirlsm.jpg" alt = "DSC06431giftbringergirlsm" width="406" height="1200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<br /> <b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Gift Bringer</b><br /><br /> Gift bringer from Assiut, Middle Egypt 12th Dynasty, around 1950 BC. Painted wood, height 528 mm.<br /><br />The figure of this girl, who has barely outgrown childhood,  belongs to the same monument category as the boat model (No. 6)  above, and has many counterparts on grave walls as part of   sacrificial scenes.<br /><br />The  primary task of this gift bringer was to provide the grave owner with ointment cones (in a basket on her head) and food - here a duck - and thus to ensure his physical well-being. But the image is more complex.<br /><br />The offering of ointments and myrrh was also a New Year's ceremony that accompanied and symbolised the annual rebirth of creation. If it was recreated in the afterlife, it meant the resurrection to new life, and the nameless servant became a partner gifted with magical power.<br /><br />The delicate, slender figure with the delicate face framed by heavy braids of hair represents the classic Egyptian ideal of beauty. The robe made of white linen covers the entire body, but is also cut so skin-tight that the charm of the youthful female body is clearly noticeable.<br /><br />Catalog:  Painted wood, Inv.

All soft tissues have vanished and the disorganisation of the skeleton is due to the disappearance of the ligaments, capsules, etc. <br /><br />Skull, Thorax, Spinal Column, and Abdomen - These are completely disorganised. The lower jaw has been dislocated and is almost edentulous. One of the bones of the skull is in the region of the left iliac fossa. All the ribs are dislocated but not fractured. Many of the vertebrae appear to be missing but two lumbar vertebrae are still articulated. These show evidence of osteo-arthritis with gross lipping. Many loose teeth with worn caps lie amongst the bones. No evidence of viscera, packing material, or amulets. Complete dislocation of the sacrum and pubic symphysis. Well-marked osteo-arthritic changes involve the left hip. No fractures seen.</p><br clear ="all"><p>Arms - Extended, dislocated at the shoulder and elbow joints. Hands, with extended fingers, in pubic region. No fractures seen.Legs - The bones appear healthy and are free from fractures and lines of arrested growth. Both ankles are dislocated and the right os calcis is lying free at the foot end of the coffin.The mummy, lying in a deep, rectangular wooden coffin with painted gesso including hieroglyphic text, is wrapped in fine cloth, and the head and thorax are covered by a painted cartonnage mask and breast plate. A wooden headrest is placed by the side of the head.<br /><br />Catalog: EA46631<br />Photo:  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 <br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images35/img_9766ankh.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9766ankhsm.jpg" alt = "Ankhef" width="697" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Bow and arrows, and a walking stick. <br /><br /></b>These were found on the lid of the coffin.

Hogarth in 1907, in a small rock-cut tomb (no. 9) in the necropolis of the city of Asyut. The tomb was discovered undisturbed, and contained four burials. Two of these, in plain uninscribed coffins were place end to end behind a screen of plaster, brick and stone. A third undecorated coffin lay in the area immediately behind the door of the tomb. The coffin of Ankhef was positioned at the south-east corner of the tomb, concealed by a partition made from parts of old coffins. A stick and bow and arrows lay on the lid of the coffin. Pottery vessels had been laid on the floor in front of the partition, perhaps representing Ankhef's funerary offerings. </p><br clear ="all"><p>  The bodies had been searched for valuables at the time of burial, as indicated by disturbed wrappings and in the case of Ankhef the displacement of the headrest in the coffin. Evidence of theft was found in many of the undisturbed tombs in this cemetery, and was probably carried out by those responsible for the burial. <br /><br /> Original artwork: Claire Thorne<br />Rephotography: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Poster, British Museum &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>	<a href="images39/dsc07613duckreceptacle.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images39/dsc07613duckreceptaclesm.jpg" alt = "dsc07613duckreceptaclesm" width="877" height="300"  hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a><br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Vessel in the form of a duck<br /><br /></b>Middle kingdom, 12th Dynasty<br /><br />Catalog:  Wood,   ÄM 6774<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin<!-- ,  http://www.smb-digital.de/ --> (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images40/img_9956jarconvexlid.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/img_9956jarconvexlidsm.jpg" alt = "img_9956jarconvexlidsm" width="353" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Calcite Canopic Jar</b><br /><br />Jars with shallow convex lids such as this were characteristic of the Old Kingdom (late 4th to 6th Dynasties), but were still occasionally used in the Middle Kingdom.  <br /><br />Diameter 170 mm, height 260 mm, circa  1&nbsp;985&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;795&nbsp;BC.  <br /><br />Catalog: Calcite, Deir el-Bersha, EA35083<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum, https://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images40/img_9955headliddedjar.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/img_9955headliddedjarsm.jpg" alt = "img_9955headliddedjarsm" width="290" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Calcite Canopic Jar</b><br /><br />Calcite Canopic Jar with painted wooden lid. <br /><br />  Diameter 178 mm, height 295 mm,  circa   1&nbsp;985&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;795&nbsp;BC <br /><br />Catalog: Calcite body,  wooden human-headed lid coated in plaster (?),  Deir el-Bersha, EA35084<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum, https://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <p><a href="images39/dsc07672granary.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images39/dsc07672granarysm.jpg" alt = "dsc07672granarysm" width="460" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images39/dsc07673granaryrear.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images39/dsc07673granaryrearsm.jpg" alt = "dsc07673granaryrearsm" width="384" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Model of a granary</b><br /><br />Catalog:  Siut, Wood,     ÄM  12548 <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin<!-- ,  http://www.smb-digital.de/ --> (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p>	<a href="images37/img_6204stridingfigure.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/img_6204stridingfiguresm.jpg" alt = "munich egyptian exhibits " width="236" height="500"  hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a>			<a href="images37/dsc09580figureofaman.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/dsc09580figureofamansm.jpg" alt = "munich egyptian exhibits " width="247" height="500"  hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a>	<b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Figure of a man. <br /><br /></b>Standing-striding figure of a man.

This desire is documented both in royal and private sculptures. Although most of the private statues were still created for the grave, royal permission allowed private individuals to erect statues in temples so as to be represented before the gods, but also to publicly emphasise the social position of the owner . This possibility, as well as the exact study of   physiognomy and anatomy, allowed  works  of exceptional quality to emerge, and the perfection of the art of the Middle Kingdom was still regarded as 'Classical Art' in later times, and provided stimulating examples to follow.  <br /><br />In the late Twelfth  Dynasty, the 'rediscovery' of the strongly personal image of the old age took place, following examples from the Old Kingdom. From now on, the human face drawn from life was central to the representations. Portraits of full individual traits emerge, although filtered through the mask of royal portraits. Thus the figure of Chertihotep, the master of the estate, also shows the  characteristic features which are to be found in the royal images of this period. <br /><br />Eyes, ears, the mouth with slightly bent corners, and cheek surfaces, however, are more formalistic than those of the royal models. A correct official mien, but also a healthy self-confidence characterise the facial expression. Chertihotep sits on a stool with low backrest. His body is enveloped by a close-fitting mantle, which uniquely emphasises the strictly self-contained, tension-loaded body structure of the figure and directs the main attention entirely to the fine, sensitively modeled facial features. You see a face full of plastic vitality. The waves of the wig are only slightly indicated,  and lead to an almost block-like body, the contours of which are distinctly under the mantle. <br /><br />The hands, too, which are held flat, are also arranged to keep the mantle closed.    On the other hand, the feet, which are designed with soft, anatomically accurate and detailed lines, are quite different. <br /><br />Catalog: Quartzite, el Burg el Hamam (east bank of Siut / Assiut), ÄM 15700<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin,   http://www.smb-digital.de/  (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images36/img_2292sesostris.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/img_2292sesostrissm.jpg" alt = "sesostris" width="700" height="312" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "15"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p><a href="images36/img_2293sesostris.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/img_2293sesostrissm.jpg" alt = "sesostris" width="700" height="323" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "15"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p><br /><b>Twelfth  Dynasty:  1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC - 1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Overseer Sesostris</b> <br /><br />Stela of the chamberlain Sesostris, circa 1&nbsp;976&nbsp;BC - 1&nbsp;794&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Rectangular stela, four lines of offering text and appeal to the living, with Senusert, Overseer of the antechamber, seated at table.

Sesostris I ( Hellenization of the original Senuosret I, or Sunusret I )     was an Egyptian ruler of the 12th dynasty .<br /><br />Chancellor Nakhti's    largest statue is on the first floor, in room 23.<br /><br />His tomb in Assiut, in Middle Egypt, is a good example of a notable provincial burial in the Middle Kingdom, with its rectangular sarcophagus, its model tools and models of farm activities.<br /><br />When French archeologists explored the necropolis of Assiut in Middle Egypt in 1903, they unearthed twenty-six tombs, twenty-one of which had escaped pillagers for nearly four millennia. The tomb they named no.  7 is Chancellor Nakhti's tomb, whose offering chapel and four burial chambers provided the largest cache of funerary furniture and equipment on the site, both in terms of quantity and quality. The finds were divided between the Cairo Museum and the Louvre Museum.<br /><br />Two alcoves were dug in the stone of the chapel's north and west walls. They held two wooden statues designed for Nakhti's funerary cult. Alongside them were accessories and models designed to perpetuate the offerings that had to be provided for eternity.<br /><br />The hull of this wooden model has a traditional crescent profile. Its ends end in a vertical structure. Eight rowers are led by a sounder standing at the bow whose duty it was to test the depth of water with his pole, given the many shifting sandbanks under the Nile River. The rear pivot rudders at the rear consist of two oars controlled by the helmsman. The sail  and the yards were dismantled and stored on a rack above to free up room for the rowers.<br /><br />Catalog: Nakhti's tomb at Assiut, Sully, Rez-de-chaussée, Le Nil, Salle 336, Vitrine 2, le Nil, E 12027<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source and text:  Louvre Museum, Paris, France<br />Additional text: http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/, https://www.louvre.fr/, http://www.marine-antique.net/Modele-reduit-de-Nakhti?lang=es, Wikipedia <!-- https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/large-statue-chancellor-nakhti --> </p><br clear ="all"><br /><p><!-- <a href="images37/img_2687bakeryb.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/img_2687bakerybsm.jpg" alt = "bakery model" width="465" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> --><a href="images39/dsc07288bakery.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images39/dsc07288bakerysm.jpg" alt = "bakery model" width="448" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images37/img_2688bakeryb.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/img_2688bakerybsm.jpg" alt = "bakery model" width="442" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Model of a bakery.  </b><br /><br />  Workers grinding and baking.   <br /><br /> Catalog: Achmim,  wood,  ÄM 10828<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><!-- <a href="images37/img_2612hedgehog.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/img_2612hedgehogsm.jpg" alt = "img_2612hedgehogsm" width="444" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>--><a href="images40/dsc07246hedgehog.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/dsc07246hedgehogsm.jpg" alt = "dsc07246hedgehogsm" width="410" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images40/img_2612hedgehoga.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/img_2612hedgehogasm.jpg" alt = "img_2612hedgehogasm" width="449" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Hedgehog.  </b><br /><br /> Faience, blue, dark blue; painted, circa 1 800 BC<br /><br />Dimensions: 50 x 55 x 93 mm</p><br clear = "all"><p>The hedgehog has been very popular since prehistoric times because it symbolises a peaceful nature.

This imported timber was of superior quality to the native Egyptian woods, and its use for the main components of the coffin was a sign of the high status of the owner. <br /><br />The coffins are similarly decorated. A pair of eyes on the east side enabled the dead man to look towards the rising sun. The horizontal and vertical inscriptions on the exterior request offerings and invoke the protection of various gods. The omission of a plastered or painted background allowed the distinctive grain of the costly cedarwood to be displayed. <br /><br />The inner sides of the coffins symbolically represent the walls of the tomb, and are densely covered with religious inscriptions and images. Below an offering formula in coloured hieroglyphs comes a frieze of objects to equip the deceased for the afterlife. A large painted false door on the east side acted as a magical portal to enable Gua's spirit to pass in and out. The remaining areas contain extracts from the <i>Coffin Texts</i>.<br /><br />These assisted Gua in his passage to the afterlife, and included a self-contained composition known as the <i>Book of Two Ways</i>. The texts of the outer coffin include one of the earliest known examples of the spell to activate shabtis, the funerary figurines.  </blockquote>  Text above from a poster at the British Museum,    &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /><br /><p><a href="images35/img_9779guaservant.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9779guaservantsm.jpg" alt = "Coffin of Gua models" width="243" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Servant of Gua</b><br /><br />Painted and gessoed wooden female figure with basket of loaves and meat on head.<br /><br />This statuette is made from a native timber, probably tamarisk, and represents a servant carrying food offerings for the owner of the tomb.

The arms, fronts of the feet, and base were made separately. Both of the fists were drilled to hold implements now lost, probably a 'sekhem' sceptre in the right hand, possibly another baton or a rolled cloth in the left. Though the statue may have been entirely painted, all that survives is black on the hair, black and white on the eyes, and white on the finger- and toenails. The nipples were indicated by the inlaying of tiny bits of darker wood. His short curly hairdo was particularly popular during the Eleventh and early Twelfth Dynasties, for both men and women. His long kilt   may be meant to indicate maturity here, despite the youthful hairstyle and body.<br /><br />Circa 1 985 BC - 1 878 BC, height 340 mm, length of plinth 136 mm, width 105 mm.  <br /><br />Catalog: Believed to be from the tomb of Gua, EA30715<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images35/img_9781neckrest.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9781neckrestsm.jpg" alt = "Coffin of Gua headrest" width="383" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Ivory headrest</b><br /><br />The majority of headrests which have been found in tombs were made of wood or stone.

Shields and staves are also stored amidships. The post in the centre of the hull may have been substituted for an original mast. The paddles and steering oar have also been lost. The construction of the model illustrates the selection of different woods by the carpenter according to the task in hand. <br /><br />The cloaked statuette of the owner, the most prestigious in the group, is carefully carved from cedar wood, as are the two posts and one of the staves - small components for which a wood with fine grain was required. All other figures, and the hull of the craft, are made from the less expensive and more coarsely grained indigenous sycomore. <br /><br />This is a wooden model boat with paddlers and soldiers.  The hull is narrow and shallow with a sheer-line curving sharply upwards at the stern, where there is a raised block notched for the steering-oar. The hull is painted red and the deck white with the usual deck-plan in red, though owing to the fading of the paint it is not possible to record the details with certainty. There may have been six pairs of spaces, but whether there was a mast-space remains doubtful. The deck has been hollowed from the original block of wood to leave gunwales on each side, but is so steeply cambered that amidships the longitudinal centre-line of the deck is above the level of the gunwales, which merge into the fore- and after-decks. <br /><br />These decks are slightly raised and not cambered. In the case of the after-deck the line of the gunwales is continued by shallow grooves cut in the deck. The fore-deck may once have been painted red all over, and had a centre strip of which there remain only the mark where it once lay and a single peg-hole. About 13 mm to   25 mm has been lost from the bows. The after-deck also was once painted red all over. There is no mast or rigging; whether it was lost or originally non-existent is not clear. The place where a mast would normally stand is taken by a stout wooden post. There is a steering-post aft. The post is painted red and is circular in section on a square base and grooved at the top. <br /><br />Amidships, where normally a mast would stand, is a second steering-post which certainly is misplaced; it is possible that the maker of the model substituted this post for the mast, perhaps because he was out of stock of masts. This second post is octagonal on a square base.  The two side faces of the octagon are rounded off at the top of the post, which is deeply grooved. It is painted white on the shaft, red at the top, and white in the groove. At the foot the white paint has been partly overlaid with red. On either side of the steering-block the stern is pierced by two holes of uncertain purpose which may possibly have held lashings to hold the steering-oar in the notch. <br /><br />There is another small hole on the starboard side of the after-deck which may once have held a peg for the helmsman, and there are others on the main deck with the stumps of pegs in them, though it is not clear what purpose they served. Amidships is a curious erection made of two long shields which are painted to represent oxhide with the stitching on the edges marked by black spots. The straight edges at the bottom rest against the gunwales and the rounded tops lean inwards on a thick post of circular section which rises a little above them. Each shield has two holes in it, perhaps for holding a thong for carrying. The post is painted to represent a covering of oxhide with two rows of stitching on the after side, with red on the top. It rises from a wooden object shaped like a small boat with a raised central portion. Around the flat surface of this object are nine holes with short wooden sticks in them, and there is one more in the raised portion. It shows traces of red paint on a white base and the posts were red with black tips, though but little paint now survives.<br /><br />In the stern is a hole for the peg which once secured the figure of the missing helmsman. Forward of the steering-post is a group of five soldiers, of whom the aftermost is facing to larboard (left) while the other four look in the general direction of the stern. They carry a small shield  on the left arm, which is sharply bent at the elbow with the fist close to the shoulder; the right arm of the aftermost soldier is missing. The middle figure on the larboard side holds his left arm straight down with the hand a little in front of the leg; it holds a thin straight object which may be intended either for a staff or a javelin. His opposite number on the starboard side has a short straight piece of wood in his right hand. <br /><br />These men wear black wigs and white skirts extending just below the knee and white tunics  covering their sides and meeting on the chest and back, though only on the aftermost figure is this garment indicated clearly; on the others the white paint partly has fallen away, leaving the red skin-colour beneath. <br /><br />Between the curious erection amidships and the 'mast' is a seated figure of some dignity and most careful workmanship. It represents a squatting man covered completely except for his head in a long white cloak concealing his arms and wearing a short black wig. Despite the fact that this figure is on a smaller scale than the soldiers and crew, its fine execution and the all-enveloping cloak, as well as the squatting attitude, indicate that this is the owner of the vessel. His unwarlike garb and attitude, as well as the smallness of the squad of soldiers, suggest that the latter are merely an escort of armed retainers accompanying a magnate on his travels, and that this is not a war-boat. The relatively small size and the fine work of the figure of the owner show that it was carved independently by a skilled and sensitive craftsman, whereas the personnel of the boat give the impression of being just good-quality stock figures.<br /><br />Forward of the 'mast' sit three pairs of paddlers with their handless arms sloping out and down at an angle of 45&deg;-50&deg;. The attitude is rather that of rowers, but the fact that the figures face forward indicates that they are paddlers - unless the maker of the model has blundered. The figures are red with black wigs and white skirts, but the legs are cut off below the knee, as if to suggest that the lower parts of the legs are hidden within the hull. In the bows stands the pilot with his arms stretched down and slightly forward and his legs slightly apart, facing to starboard (right). The features of the crew are only roughly indicated, but all of them, escort as well as paddlers, have their eyes painted on.  <br /><br />Length 1392 mm, depth 76 mm, width 222 mm.  <br /><br />Circa 1 985 BC - 1 878 BC.  <br /><br />Catalog: Believed to be from the tomb of Gua, EA35293<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/,  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images35/img_9791coffinend.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9791coffinendsm.jpg" alt = "Coffin of Gua" width="305" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><!-- <a href="images35/img_9791coffinend.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9791coffinendsm.jpg" alt = "Coffin of Gua" width="183" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> --><!-- <a href="images35/img_9792canopicchest.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9792canopicchestsm.jpg" alt = "Coffin of Gua" width="534" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> --><br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Coffin of Gua</b><br /><br />On the left, the the south facing foot of  the rectangular wooden outer coffin of Gua. <br /><br />On the right, Gua's canopic chest. <br /><br />Wooden canopic chest of Gua of cubical shape with lid.

There are few records of how mummification was done. What is known is based mainly on accounts by Classical authors, and studies of the mummies themselves. The panels above explain the procedure as it was carried out in about 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;BC, the high point of Egyptian embalming.  <br /><br />After death, the body was taken to the <i>ibu</i>, or Tent of Purification, to be washed in a solution of natron in water (1). The antiseptic natron helped delay decomposition. Embalming took place at or near the tomb in the <i>wabet</i> (Place of Purification) or <i>Per-nefer</i> (House of Rejuvenation). <br /><br /> First, the internal organs were removed (2), the parts of the body which decayed most rapidly. The brain was usually extracted via the nose, and discarded. The other organs were removed through an incision in the left flank, and were set aside. Often these were interred separately in special Canopic containers.  The heart remained, as it would be important in the judgement of the dead person before the gods.   <br /><br />    The body was then dried out, to eliminate the possibility of bacterial activity and decay (3). The torso was filled with bags of natron and loose natron powder was packed around the corpse. It was left for about  40 days. This is the minimum time required for dessication of a body using this method.      <br /><br />      After drying, the skull and chest cavities were filled (4). During the Twenty First Dynasty, and at other times, the liver, lungs, stomach and intestines were replaced inside the body, wrapped in separate linen packages. The body would have lost virtually all its fat, leaving the skin loose and wrinkled. Sometimes sand, linen or mud was inserted under the skin of the face and limbs to restore the shrunken features.     <br /><br /> Resin was applied to the surface of the body (5), to exclude moisture and perhaps to confer divine status on the dead person. Before wrapping, artificial eyes were placed in the sockets, and finger and toe covers of gold or silver were put on. During wrapping (6) amulets, jewellery and sometimes a rolled funerary papyrus were placed on the body. As the mummy was wrapped in linen cloth, prayers and magical spells were recited. Steps four, five and six as in the diagrams above took another thirty days, making a total of seventy days for the whole process. </blockquote>Text above:  Poster, British Museum, &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- <p><a href="images35/img_9718senbi.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9718senbism.jpg" alt = "Shabti of Senbi" width="208" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Shabti of Senbi</b><br /><br />Painted wooden shabti of Senbi. <br /><br />From Meir. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: &copy;

Dimensions of the middle coffin: 2200 x 630 x  760 mm.<br /><br />Also typical for its time of origin is the decoration scheme, which corresponds to the view of the coffin as a dwelling-house of the deceased for eternity. The vertical and horizontal inscription ribbons divide the outer sides into several image fields in which the motif of Egyptian palace facades is depicted. In the right field of the left longitudinal side, a pair of so-called Udjat eyes are also visible. They were based on the time-typical lateral position of the mummy in the coffin. Thus, the pair of eyes not only represents the connection of the deceased with the outside world, but it also serves for the magical protection of the dead.<br /><br />The insides of the coffin are also decorated. Beneath the hieroglyphic sacrificial formula you can see the depictions of different furniture, clothes, food, drinks, etc. placed on the tables. With the help of these representations, everything that could be enjoyed in earthly life should be made available to the dead in the hereafter. The underlying sayings belong to the so-called coffin texts. These are proverbs referring to the transformation of the deceased into a new and eternal existence in the hereafter. <br /><br />Catalog: Thebes West, Tomb of Mentuhotep,  Painted Wood,   ÄM 10, ÄM 11<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, http://www.smb-digital.de/,  (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br />Additional text: I.

Mentuhotep is one of the best attested officials of the Middle Kingdom period. There is a series of statues found at Karnak, showing him as a scribe. On these he has been given the title of overseer of all royal works, which would suggest that he was involved in overseeing the construction of the temple at Karnak. </p><br clear = "all"><p>    At el-Lisht he had a large tomb next to the pyramid of Senusret I. When it was found it was badly damaged, but there are remains of high quality reliefs and fragments of statues. The burial chamber still contained two sarcophagi, one smashed and the other one well preserved, made of granite and with brightly painted interiors.<br /><br />Dimensions, including rudder: 1410 x 360 x 600 mm. <br /><br />This ship from the tomb of Treasurer Mentuhotep   is a travel boat, which - as the stowed mast shows - is on the ride downstream. The hull is painted green, the deck white with red stripes, which would probably reflect the beam construction. The mast and the two yards  normally would rest amidships on the white support post made for them. Mentuhotep sits in the cabin behind it, (&#8239;<i>not readily visible in this image&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>) almost mummified in a white coat, on which his title and name are written. A stone anchor is stored in the prow. <br /><br />On the outside of the yellow-painted cabin, black lines seem to indicate lacing. The  shield of the Mentuhotep is painted on one side. The crew consists of 16 oarsmen, a pilot  at the bow and a steersman at the helm. One servant grinds grain, another kneads dough.<br /><br />(&#8239;<i>note that in the closeup we can see that the models in the boat have both arms capable of movement. Obviously the models were made in bulk, though for a specific role such as a rower or a grinder of grain or helmsman on board the vessel, but the final adjustment of the arms was able to be accomplished with ease. The ingenious design and construction of the rudder is also interesting, providing the ability to  ride up out of the way without damage if an obstruction was encountered, such as a sand bank or a snag, but being also capable of fine adjustment with the long lever provided for the steersman. Note also that the actual boat itself must have had more robust connections for that of the rudder pole to the support pole in the back of the boat, as well as that of the rudder pole to the stern of the boat, than are shown in this model. These connections may have been in the form of  thick,  robust 'dowels', with a large amount of 'play' or 'slop', but with  strong cordage to keep everything together&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />Catalog: Thebes West, Tomb of Mentuhotep, Stuccoed, Painted Wood,   ÄM 12<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, http://www.smb-digital.de/,  (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><!-- <a href="images37/img_2780servant.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images37/img_2780servantsm.jpg" alt = "img_2780servantsm" width="296" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>--><a href="images39/dsc06865servant.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images39/dsc06865servantsm.jpg" alt = "dsc06865servantsm model" width="228" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twelfth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Treasurer Mentuhotep     </b><br /><br />  An offering bearer from the tomb of Mentuhotep, holding a Hes-vase.  <br /><br />Catalog: Thebes West, Tomb of Mentuhotep,  Painted Wood,   ÄM 22<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, http://www.smb-digital.de/,  (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> <p><!-- <a href="images36/img_2388sesostris.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/img_2388sesostrissm.jpg" alt = "img_2388sesostrissm" width="309" height="450" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>--><a href="images39/dsc07574sesostrisiii.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images39/dsc07574sesostrisiiism.jpg" alt = "dsc07574sesostrisiiism" width="439" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images39/dsc07573sesostrisiii.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images39/dsc07573sesostrisiiism.jpg" alt = "dsc07573sesostrisiiism" width="415" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Twelfth  Dynasty:  1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC - 1&nbsp;802&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Senusret III / Sesostris III</b><br /><br />Head of a statue of the Pharoah Senusret III / Sesostris III<br /><br />1&nbsp;875&nbsp;BC - 1&nbsp;840&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Senusret III is well known for his distinctive statues which are almost immediately recognisable as his.

As early as the end of the New Kingdom, coffins and papyri started to replace tomb walls as bearers fo depictions. <br /><br />Yet the images no longer illustrated the daily life of the artisans and farmers, or the feasts of affluent Egyptians, but instead showed events in the Afterlife.

His upper arms are close to the body, while his forearms and outstretched hands rest on his thighs. The upper ends of his calf-length apron are knotted underneath his chest. The striking head is dominated by a hairless, angular skull with very large, protruding ears. The face shows a serious, albeit confident expression, which is mainly determined by the mouth area.<br /><br />To the right of him is a standing female figure in a simple ankle-length strap dress with long hair, of which two strands lie on the chest, up to knee height. With her left hand she embraces the man's calf - even if this gesture is only hinted at.</p><br clear = "all"><p>Without the inscription, which is located on both sides of the seat, a clear identification of the people would be almost impossible. This inscription shows that the seat figure is the brewer Renef-seneb-dag together with his daughter Daget. The man is called  'loved by his master, who is justified in his heart, a man of feast, loved by the myrrh, united with the 'beautiful day' [the feast]. In a sacrificial formula, he asks the cataract gods Chnum, Satis and Anukis for cool water that comes from one of the Nile springs on Elephantine. This mention in particular makes it very likely that the statuette on the island was placed in the first cataract in one of the sanctuaries there.<br />(Jana Helmbold-Doyé)<br /><br />Catalog: ÄM 10115<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin,  http://www.smb-digital.de/,  (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> <p><a href="images41/DSC01605ea553offeringtable.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images41/DSC01605ea553offeringtablesm.jpg" alt = "DSC01605ea553offeringtablesm" width="450" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<br /><b>Twelfth - Thirteenth  Dynasty:  1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;639&nbsp;BC <br /><br />Black granite offering-table with representations of vases and cakes, and  hieroglyphic text</b> <br /><br />The surface is carved in relief with images of food and drink offerings. <br /><br /> Length 360 mm, width 290 mm. <br /><br /> Catalog: Granite, provenance unknown, EA553<br />Photo:  Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  Card with the display at the British Museum, <!-- https://www.britishmuseum.org/,-->  &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images42/DSC01637EA56842.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images42/DSC01637EA56842sm.jpg" alt = "DSC01637EA56842sm" width="340" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<br /><b>Twelfth - Thirteenth  Dynasty:  1&nbsp;991&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;639&nbsp;BC <br /><br />Gilded Statue</b><br /><br />Gilded wooden statuette of an unidentified man. <br /><br />Although the man is not a king, he wears the royal shendyt kilt, an example of the use of kingly attributes in artistic representation.

During a Sothic cycle, the 365-day year loses enough time that the start of its year once again coincides with the heliacal rising of the star Sirius   on 19 July in the Julian calendar. It is an important aspect of Egyptology, particularly with regard to reconstructions of the Egyptian calendar and its history. Astronomical records of this displacement may have been responsible for the later establishment of the more accurate Julian and Alexandrian calendars.<br /><br />Above text from Wikipedia<br /><br /><p><a href="images35/buhenfortress.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/buhenfortresssm.jpg" alt = "Fortress in Nubia" width="405" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Thirteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;803&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;639&nbsp;BC<br /><br />The Buhen Fortress<br /><br /></b>Buhen was an ancient Egyptian settlement situated on the West bank of the Nile below (to the North of) the Second Cataract.

They include some of the most sophisticated examples of military architecture known from the ancient world. The mud brick fortresses were situated on the banks and islands of the Nile. No two were identical but standard features included defensive ditches, ramparts, bastions and massive gates with wooden drawbridges. Within the walls stood barracks, work- shops, administrative quarters and temples. <br /><br />   Egyptian troops were stationed in the fortresses as garrisons. Their role was to control the movements of the local population and to protect the annexed territory against possible attack. The fortresses also functioned as bases for gold mining and copper smelting operations and were collection points for trade goods and raw materials. When Egypt lost control over Lower Nubia during the 13th Dynasty, most of the forts were abandoned. A few were captured by Kushites, Nubians from Kerma, when they advanced from Upper Nubia to take over the lands vacated by the Egyptians.<br /><br /></blockquote>  Text above: Poster at the British Museum, &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<br clear ="all"/><br /><br /><p><a href="images35/img_9038report.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images35/img_9038reportsm.jpg" alt = "Report from Nubia" width="449" height="350" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>Thirteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;803&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;639&nbsp;BC<br /><br />The Semna Despatches<br /><br /></b> Circa 1 780 BC. <br /><br />The Semna Despatches are part of a hieratic papyrus containing copies of reports by the commanders of Egyptian forts in Lower Nubia, sent to an official at Thebes.

His villa is depicted in his tomb on the Theban west bank. The residence itself has a central reception hall with a raised roof, surrounded by private quarters. Surrounding the house are gardens, stables, workshops and grain silos. The whole is surrounded by a high outer wall. <br /><br />Neferhotep is the author of the  Papyrus Boulaq 18, which  is an ancient Egyptian administrative document. It contains an account of the Theban palace dating to the 13th Dynasty (around 1&nbsp;750&nbsp;BC). The papyrus lists the palace officials and the rations they received day by day. Important officials mentioned are, for example, the vizier Ankhu, but also the queen Aya. Therefore, the document is of great historical importance. It also reports the journey of the king to the temple at Medamud and reports the arrival of a delegation of Nubians.<br /><br />Reconstruction:  G.J.M.

The Hyksos preferred to stay in northern Egypt since they infiltrated from the north-east. The names and order of kings is uncertain. The Turin King list indicates that there were six Hyksos kings, with an obscure Khamudi listed as the final king of the Fifteenth Dynasty. Only five are listed here.  <br /><br />Hyksos,  Hekau Khasut,  'ruler(s) of foreign lands' is a term which, in modern Egyptology, designates the kings of the Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt.  The seat of power of these kings was the city of Avaris in the Nile delta, from where they ruled over Lower and Middle Egypt up to Cusae. In the Aegyptiaca, a history of Egypt written by the Graeco-Egyptian priest and historian Manetho in the 3rd century BC, the term Hyksos is used ethnically to designate people of probable West Semitic, Levantine origin.  While Manetho portrayed the Hyksos as invaders and oppressors, this interpretation is questioned in modern Egyptology.  Instead, Hyksos rule might have been preceded by groups of Canaanite peoples who gradually settled in the Nile delta from the end of the Twelfth Dynasty onwards and who may have seceded from the crumbling and unstable Egyptian control at some point during the Thirteenth Dynasty.  <br /><br />The Hyksos period marks the first in which Egypt was ruled by foreign rulers.  Many details of their rule, such as the true extent of their kingdom and even the names and order of their kings, remain uncertain. The Hyksos practiced many Levantine or Canaanite customs, but also many Egyptian customs. They have been credited with introducing several technological innovations to Egypt, such as the horse and chariot, as well as the sickle sword and the composite bow, but this theory is disputed.  <br /><br />The Hyksos did not control all of Egypt. Instead, they coexisted with the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Dynasties, which were based in Thebes. Warfare between the Hyksos and the pharaohs of the late Seventeenth Dynasty eventually culminated in the defeat of the Hyksos by Ahmose I, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.   In the following centuries, the Egyptians would portray the Hyksos as bloodthirsty and oppressive foreign rulers. <br /><br />Text above adapted from Wikipedia.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" class="style3">	<thead>        <tr>            <th class="headline" colspan="3" align="center" >Fifteenth Dynasty</th>         </tr>	</thead>	    <tbody>      	<tr>            <th class="headlinelower" align="center" >Name</th>              	<th class="headlinelower" align="center">Dates</th>	<th class="headlinelower" align="center">Comments</th>        </tr>    </thead>        <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Salitis</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;650&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>        </tr>       <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Sakir-Har</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Named as an early Hyksos king on a doorjamb found at Avaris.

Part of the base plate and three toes of the left foot of the statuette have been repaired in modern times. The man's right arm is no longer preserved above the elbow up to the palm. The face of the subject is dominated by large, almond-shaped eyes that stand out due to their black design and are delimited above by brow arches, which are also black. </p><br clear = "all"><p>The nose flares out in broad wings, whereas the mouth is rather narrow and not  emphasised. The face is framed by a shoulder-length, smooth hairstyle, which is painted  blue. We can note also the oversized ears that are so characteristic of the Middle Kingdom.<br /><br />On the right side of the stool is a four-column hieroglyphic inscription that was filled with blue paint and contains a formula for sacrifice. In it, the sitter asks the 'great god' to make a sacrifice of bread, beer, beef and poultry for his continued existence in the hereafter. The text also mentions the man's name 'Sobeknihotep'. <br /><br />The statuette was donated to the museum. The exact place of origin and the context of the find are unknown. However, based on the inscription and other comparative examples, it can be assumed that the statuette was placed in a private grave. The eyes, which  appear very large, are typical for the beginning of the 12th dynasty and thus to the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, since these are  a characteristic of the First Intermediate Period. In terms of craftsmanship, due to the coarser surface treatment and simpler design, this object was produced in a provincial workshop.<br /><br />(Jessica Jancziak)<br /><br />Height x width x depth 270 x 95 x 160 mm, weight 2.86 kg.<br /><br />Catalog: Painted limestone,   ÄM 12546   <br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neues Museum, Germany <br />Text: &copy; Card at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin,  https://smb.museum-digital.de, (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE)<br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p>	<a href="images40/IMG_6137senetiatju.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/IMG_6137senetiatjusm.jpg" alt = "IMG_6137senetiatjusm" width="249" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><b>The Fifteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;650&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;550&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Senet-iatju</b><br /><br />Seated figure of Senet-iatju. <br /><br />Circa&nbsp;1&nbsp;600&nbsp;BC.<br /><br />Catalog:  Limestone,  ÄS 7122<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, Ägyptischen Museum München<br />Text: &copy; Ägyptischen Museum München<br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p>	<a href="images40/DSC06176daggers.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC06176daggerssm.jpg" alt = "DSC06176daggerssm" width="469" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>	<a href="images40/DSC06177dagger.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC06177daggersm.jpg" alt = "DSC06177daggersm" width="128" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p><b>The Fifteenth Dynasty: 1&nbsp;650&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;550&nbsp;BC<br /><br />Daggers</b><br /><br />Bronze daggers with gilding, and using ebony and ivory.  <br /><br />Catalog:  Bronze, ebony, ivory, gilding,  Inv.

The armies of the 15th dynasty, winning town after town from their southern enemies, continually encroached on the 16th dynasty territory, eventually threatening and then conquering Thebes itself. In his study of the second intermediate period, the egyptologist Kim Ryholt has suggested that Dedumose I sued for a truce in the latter years of the dynasty, but one of his predecessors, Nebiryraw I, may have been more successful and seems to have enjoyed a period of peace in his reign. <br /><br />Famine, which had plagued Upper Egypt during late 13th Dynasty and the 14th Dynasty, also blighted the 16th Dynasty, most evidently during and after the reign of Neferhotep III. <br /><br /> <br /><br />   <br /><table align="center" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" class="style3">	<thead>        <tr>            <th class="headline" colspan="4" align="center" >Sixteenth Dynasty</th>         </tr>	</thead>	    <tbody>	        <tr>            <th class="headlinelower" align="center" >Name</th>			<th class="headlinelower" align="center">Years</th>			<th class="headlinelower" align="center">Dates</th>			<th class="headlinelower" align="center">Comments</th>        </tr>    <tbody>        <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Unknown</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >1</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;649&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;648&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Name lost in a lacuna of the Turin canon</td>        </tr>       <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Sekhemre-sementawi&nbsp;Djehuti</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >3</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;648&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;645&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp; </td>        </tr>                <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Sekhemre-seusertawi&nbsp;Sobekhotep&nbsp;VIII</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >16</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;645&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;629&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>        </tr>                <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Sekhemre-seankhtawi&nbsp;Neferhotep III</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >1</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;629&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;628&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>        </tr>                  <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Seankhenre&nbsp;Mentuhotepi</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >1</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;628&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;627&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>        </tr>                  <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Sewadjenre&nbsp;Nebiryraw I</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >26</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;627&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;601&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>        </tr>              <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Nebiriau&nbsp;II</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >1</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;601&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>        </tr>                   <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Semenre</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >1</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;601&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;600&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>        </tr>                     <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Seuserenre&nbsp;Bebiankh</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >2</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;600&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;588&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>        </tr>                     <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Sekhemre&nbsp;Shedwaset</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >1</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;588&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</td>        </tr>                       <tr>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Unknown</td>            <td class="style1" align="right" >6</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >1&nbsp;588&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;582&nbsp;BC</td>            <td class="style1" align="left" >Five kings lost in a lacuna of the Turin Canon.</td>        </tr>                   	    </tbody></table><br /><br />Additional kings are classified as belonging to this dynasty per Kim Ryholt but their chronological position is uncertain.

This diadem  displays two cobras rather than one, which suggests that it belonged to a queen. It is most probably from the burial of Queen Montuhotep, the wife of King Djehuty, in Thebes. <br /><br />The burial was found intact by locals between 1822 and 1825. The queen's body and coffin are now lost, but copies of the coffin's decoration were made in 1832 and are now in the British Museum and the Bodleian Library, Oxford. <br /> Silver was so rare that it was deemed more valuable than gold. The cobras are made of silver with a higher gold and copper content than the rest of the diadem. The basketwork design on the headband was worked by displacing the metal (chasing). The details on the cobras and streamers are early examples of metal engraving.<br /><br />Catalog: Circa the start of the 16th Dynasty, probably from Western Thebes, cemetery of Dra Abu el-Naga. al-Sabah Collection, 2017, AESLoan.1<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: Card at the Museum, &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  <br /><br /><p><a href="images44/DSC02510uc28410.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images44/DSC02510uc28410sm.jpg" alt = "DSC02510uc28410sm" width="950" height="417" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p> <b>Second Intermediate Period: 1&nbsp;700&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;550&nbsp;BC<br /><br /> Beads</b><br /><br />Sixteenth Dynasty?<br /><br />String of blue glazed (bl.gl.) beads: cylinders between amulets with a pair of string holes - alternative Tauret/Taweret and crocodile, (exactly like 28408),  from a large basket.<br /><br />Taweret was portrayed as a bipedal hippopotamus with limbs like those of a feline.<br /><br />From  Sedment, Mayana, Cemetery K, Tomb 1288, of an old woman, Accession Number LDUCE-UC28410<br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, Petrie Museum, London, England<br />Text: Card / online catalogue,  the Petrie Museum, &copy; 2015 UCL.

the Sixteenth Dynasty, also based in Thebes.In March 2012, French archeologists examining a limestone door in the Amun-Ra temple in Luxor discovered hieroglyphs with the name Senakhtenre, the first evidence of this king dating to his lifetime.   <br /><br />King Nebmaatre may have been a ruler of the early 17th dynasty.<br /><br />The last two kings of the dynasty opposed the Hyksos rule over Egypt and initiated a war that would rid Egypt of the Hyksos kings and began a period of unified rule, the New Kingdom.  <br /><br />Kamose, the second son of Seqenenre Tao and last king of the Seventeenth Dynasty, was the brother of Ahmose I – the first king of the Eighteenth Dynasty, also identified as Ahmose II.   <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0"

Rishi coffins are funerary coffins adorned with a feather design. The lid of the coffin is covered with gold leaf on a base of gesso. The king is represented wearing a royal headcloth (nemes) of unusually large proportions. A uraeus serpent was originally attached to the brow, but it is now missing and only the socket is visible. A false beard, originally fitted to the chin, is also lost, although the painted beard-straps survive on each side of the face. <br /><br />	The king's mummified body is covered with a feather design (rishi in Arabic) symbolising the protective wings of the funerary goddesses Isis and Nephthys.<br /><br />	The face itself was originally gilded, and the eyes are made from black and white stone. On the upper body is a collar with falcon-head terminals, and a winged figure (now mostly destroyed) occupied the middle of the breast. The sides of the headdress and most of the body of the coffin-lid are covered with a design of stylised feathers, although the areas at the sides of the feet have a different motif, consisting of spherical and barrel shaped beads arranged in a net-pattern.<br /><br />Catalog: EA6652<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text: http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/, &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<!-- http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=117248&partId=1 --><br /> Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images34/img_0187intef.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images34/img_0187intefsm.jpg" alt = "nubkheperra intef" width="250" height="800" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images34/img_0188intef.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images34/img_0188intefsm.jpg" alt = "nubkheperra intef" width="256" height="800" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images40/DSC00602antef.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/DSC00602antefsm.jpg" alt = "nubkheperra intef" width="285" height="800" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p>In the centre of the lid, from the collar to the level of the ankles is a single line of hieroglyphic text.

On the base of the foot are figures of the goddesses Isis and Nephthys raising their hands in a gesture of lamentation.<br /><br />A column of inscription between them contains their speech. The interior surfaces of both lid and case are thickly coated with a dark, shiny resinous substance. The mummy was apparently placed inside the coffin before this substance was dry, as substantial portions of the outer linen wrappings adhere to the inner surface of the case.Some of these fragments of the linen shroud bear funerary texts on behalf of King Intef, written in black ink (other sections, removed from the coffin in the 19th century, are EA10706). Several insects, identified as <i>Dermestes</i> beetles, are also visible, having become trapped in the sticky coating of the interior. <br /><br />Among the inscriptions on the coffin is the hieroglyphic sign for an owl ('m'), which has been intentionally drawn without legs - such a symbolic 'disabling' of a potentially harmful creature was a common feature of Egyptian script in the Second Intermediate Period.<br /><br />Length: 1932 mm.<br /><br /> Catalog: EA6652<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015, 2018<br />Source: Original, British Museum<br />Text:  http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/, &copy; Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0<!-- http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=117248&partId=1 --><br /> Additional text: Wikipedia</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images34/img_2636nubkheperra_intefnecklace.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images34/img_2636nubkheperra_intefnecklacesm.jpg" alt = "nubkheperra intef" width="443" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images34/img_2637crown_necklace_nubkheperra_intef.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images34/img_2637crown_necklace_nubkheperra_intefsm.jpg" alt = "nubkheperra intef" width="231" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p>Necklace and crown from the burial of King Intef Nubkheperre , 1635 BC. <br /><br />	This Ancient Egyptian 17th dynasty inlaid diadem or crown, composed of silver with gold uraeus (serpent) (&#8239;<i>out of focus at the back of this photo&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don</i>&nbsp;), and glass or faience inlays, is traditionally associated with the burial of the 17th dynasty Theban king Nubkheperre Intef.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 41 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/egypt2b.html responseCode 3 200

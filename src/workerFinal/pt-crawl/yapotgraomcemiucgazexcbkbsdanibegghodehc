<p>
<P>The IJCAI-97 Workshop on AI and Digital Libraries was held in Nagoya, Japan, on Sunday, August 24 1997, as part of the Workshop Program of the <A HREF="http://www.ijcai.org/ijcai-97/">Fifteenth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence</A> (IJCAI). The purpose of the workshop, as outlined in the original <A HREF="http://www.dlib.com/people/innes/aiindl/cfp.html">Call for Papers</A>, was to identify and highlight ways in which AI techniques could contribute to solving some of the challenges of building real world digital libraries, and was intended to build upon the successes of earlier IJCAI and AAAI (American Association for Artificial Intelligence) workshops on information access and navigation. Following on from the many useful AI techniques and approaches presented at these venues, the main aim of the workshop was to focus on how such techniques might be applied in the context of <EM>digital libraries</EM>.</P> 
<P>For the purposes of the workshop, and borrowing from the <A HREF="http://www.cni.org/projects/nidr/">CNI White Paper on Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval</A>, a digital library was defined to be an electronic information access system offering users a coherent view of a selected, organized, and managed body of information. As interest increases in heterogeneous, information-rich repositories - arguably, proto-digital libraries - such as the Internet and intranets, a number of technical challenges will need to be met to satisfy individual users' demands. Key among these are information discovery and retrieval, user interface design, classification and indexing, content delivery and presentation, storage management and administration, scalability, and interoperability. Faced with such challenges, a number of international agencies (most noticeably 
<A HREF="http://www.cise.nsf.gov/iris/DLHome.html">NSF, NASA, and DARPA</A> in the United States, and <A HREF="http://www.gip.jipdec.or.jp/english/project-e/project27-e.html">JIPDEC</A> [Japanese Information Processing Development Center] in Japan) have recently made available substantial funding for digital library research. AI researchers are among those participating in such large-scale digital library initiatives.</P>

<P>Particular questions that the workshop participants were asked to address included: How easily do AI techniques for general information repositories, such as the WWW, migrate to the more structured domains of digital libraries? What other AI techniques (eg. knowledge representation, machine learning) can assist in improving access to and management of digital information? and What new challenges and opportunities do real world digital libraries bring to bear on AI research? Specific topics of interest that were listed in the Call for Papers included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Information discovery and retrieval:
<UL>
<LI>information filtering;
user modelling and adaptive profiling;
use of user feedback; 
software agents for resource discovery;
knowledge-based models of information retrieval.
</UL>
<LI>User interface design:
<UL>
<LI>information access, browsing and navigation;
visualization of large repositories;

<LI>Architectural designs and issues:
<UL>
<LI>interoperability;
scaling and extensibility;
cooperative information systems;
information economies.
</UL></UL>

<P>Nine reviewed papers plus one invited talk were accepted for presentation at the workshop. The invited talk was titled <EM>Next Generation Digital Library Program in Japan</EM> and was presented by Hiroshi Mukaiyama, a senior researcher at JIPDEC, the Japanese Information Processing Development Center. In his talk, Hiroshi described the organization and scope of the 5-year national digital library initiative in Japan. Details on this project can be found <A HREF="http://www.gip.jipdec.or.jp/english/project-e/project27-e.html">here</A>.

<P>All in all, the workshop was very productive and informative. There was a lot of interesting discussion
concerning the various pieces of presented work, as well as a reasonable level of information and knowledge sharing
among the people present. At this time, there are no concrete plans to follow up with a second workshop on AI
in Digital Libraries (participants will be polled to establish the level of interest in this idea); however,
arrangements have commenced to publish expanded versions of a selection of the workshop papers in
Springer Verlag's <A HREF="http://cimic.rutgers.edu/jodl/">International Journal on Digital Libraries</A> (JODL).
This special issue on AI in Digital Libraries will be guest edited by Innes Ferguson and Ed Durfee and will likely
appear in early 1998. A Call for Papers for this issue will be published in the near future.</P>

<p>
Rob Kling and Howard Rosenbaum of Indiana University are organizing a  Workshop on "Advances in Organizational and Social Informatics" with National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsorship. The workshop, with 25 invited active researchers, will be held in Bloomington, Indiana (at Indiana University) on November 9-11, 1997. The main purposes of this workshop are to (1) identify the state of knowledge about Organizational and Social Informatics; (2) identify productive directions for new studies; and (3) help forge a research community.
<p>
Social Informatics is a relatively new term to refer to the bodies of knowledge about information technologies and social change that are variously found under labels such as "social impacts of computing," "social design," and "implementation studies" (see 
<A HREF = "http://www.slis.indiana.edu/SI">http://www.slis.indiana.edu/SI</a>). The movement has emerged from a series of lively conversations that began in early 1996among scholars with an interest in advancing research about the social aspects of computerization. They were concerned that the diversity of labels for social studies of information technologies impeded disciplinary and cross-disciplinary communication about important research results and theories. Like the name "Human Computer Interaction", the name "Social Informatics" serves as a banner to organize people who conduct research in the field and as a pointer to a body of research that could help information professionals, such as those who are interested in having digital libraries (DLs) effectively support particular communities.
<p>
Organizational Informatics is a sub-area of Social Informatics. Findings and theories belong to Organizational Informatics when they can be characterized primarily in terms of the participants of specific organizations. Using this criterion, our understandings of the adoption, use, and impacts  of groupware fall well within Organizational Informatics. In contrast, the Internet is used by millions of people outside of their work lives, and the character and consequences of the public's use of the Internet is a topic outside of Organizational Informatics, but within Social Informatics. Studies of the social scale use and social roles of digital libraries also fit within, or can be informed by, Social Informatics.
<p>
Some of the key Organizational and Social Informatics research areas include: 
<ul>
<li>impacts of information technologies on the structure and communication patterns of groups and organizations;
<li>social life with computer-mediated communication (CMC, CSCW, DLs, Electronic publishing); 
<li>the social shaping of information systems; 
<li>the production, distribution and consumption of
electronic texts; 
<li>the roles of information technologies in changing or reinforcing patterns of work life, community life, and the character of institutions. 
</ul>
<p> 
There is a notable body of systematic research about each of these topics.  But it is scattered across the journals and conferences of several disciplines including computer science, information science, information systems, and various social sciences.

<h3></a>The Art Museum Image Consortium:  Licensing
Museum Digital Documentation for Educational Use
</h3>
<P>
<font size = -1><I>J. Trant and D. Bearman, Archives &amp; Museum Informatics[<A HREF="#note1">1</A>]</I>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>On September 22, more than twenty of the largest
art museums in the USA and Canada, including the two national
galleries, will form the Art Museum Image Consortium (AMICO).
An initiative of the Association of Art Museum Directors, AMICO
will enable educational access to cultural heritage information
by creating and licensing a collective digital library of images
and documentation of works in museum collections. Its foundation
reflects the commitment of museums to an emerging new educational
opportunity.[<A HREF="#note2">2</A>] 
<P>
The founding of AMICO follows discussions earlier
this year, that defined mechanisms for the creation of a multimedia
digital library documenting and interpreting museum collections.
The agreements that frame the operation of AMICO (see 
<A HREF = "http://www.amn.org/AMICO">http://www.amn.org/AMICO</a>)
are articulated at the level of values and objectives and define
the operation of the Consortium and the licenses it will offer.
<P>
Access to the documentation held in museum collections
has long been a problem, but what was an irritation in traditional
scholarship has become a bottleneck in the networked educational
environment.[<A HREF="#note3">3</A>] The digitized text, images,
audio tours and multimedia being created in museums provide a
rich source of content for on-line curriculum. Interest in the
use of non-traditional sources is growing as technologies finally
enable their reproduction and integration.[<A HREF="#note4">4</A>]
But the cultural heritage community has lacked the economic and
distribution systems to support this use. Intellectual property
frameworks have been in flux,[<A HREF="#note5">5</A>] and Fair
Use does not enable many desired educational applications. Museums
have been without precedent or policy regarding new digital educational
uses, and some have been reluctant to grant rights at all.[<A HREF="#note6">6</A>]

<P>
A not-for profit Consortium that licenses the content
of museums collectively is the most effective means of distributing
digital information to the educational community. Membership enables
museums to do a number of things they cannot do on their own,
including:
<UL>
<LI>Creating a collective library of art for educational
uses
<LI>Reaching the educational community in a coordinated
and cost effective way
<LI>Leveraging influence with vendors to reduce costs
of capturing data
<LI>Enabling access to collective funding to pursue
educational goals
<LI>Assisting members to improve their information
infrastructures and documentation practices
<LI>Negotiating digital rights with artists, artists
estates and museums in other countries
<LI>Providing members access to each others holdings
for educational use 
</UL>

<P>
Collaborating in AMICO reduces risks for individual
museums through collective decision-making, common standards and
guidelines and shared expertise. Income supports services which
enable members to contribute to the shared Library. These may
include:
<P>
<B>1) Technology Information: </B>&quot;best
practice&quot; guidelines, &quot;frequently asked questions&quot;,
standards for data capture, advice on hardware and software, application
guidelines, training, research and liaison with standards developers.

<P>
<B>2) Data Enhancement</B>: data
value standardization, unique identifiers, watermarking of images,
subject indexing, metadata augmentation, thesaural explosion of
terms in controlled vocabularies, markup of text to SGML, and
mapping institutional data to export standards.
<P>
<B>3) Catalog Management</B>:
creating an integrated, publicly accessible directory with many
access points, so educators can identify works they have licensed
and may use through AMICO, and the public can seek further rights
(including commercial use) from individual museum members.
<P>
<B>4) Rights Management</B>:
defining rights management data requirements, creating searchable
rights systems, negotiating with individual rights holders and
their collectives, writing model licensing agreements, developing
terms of licenses for schools, school districts and public libraries,
and drafting and disseminating user training materials. 
<P>
<B>5) Customer Services</B>:
monitoring and analyzing uses and users, identifying users needs,
and promoting innovative educational uses of museum digital content.

<P>
<B>6) Collaborative Partnering</B>:
developing liaisons with technology firms, funding sources, standards
organizations, telecommunication providers, and others.
<P>
As a museum-owned collective, AMICO will be well
positioned to collaborate with government sponsored agencies in
Europe and elsewhere, following the example of sectors such as
music. 
<P>
Rather than fearing the simulacra of digital reproduction,
museums are exploring the potential of digital technologies for
developing increased familiarity with, and knowledge of the world's
material culture.[<A HREF="#note7">7</A>] In an era of shrinking
budgets and challenges to the very existence of some national
arts institutions, museums can make cultural resources relevant
and accessible to educators and students. AMICO is the first step
towards the creative use of these resources to illustrate and
explore the Humanities. Its members are banking on the development
of a visually and culturally literate public that feels an ownership
of museum collections, as a consequence of having access to digital
documentation in the course of their education.<P>

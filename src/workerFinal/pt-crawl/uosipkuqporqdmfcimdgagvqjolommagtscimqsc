don't fully appreciate the scale of the industry that we're in today. And so I think, you know, the recognition back to your question a about how long will it take? You gotta come back to the size of the existing energy system today. It is big. It will take time to replace. But my point is we got to get started on it. But I would say, you know, I can't believe you, you voluntarily went back to Allen's question, your job. I'm a glutton for what can I say? Welcome to leadership next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray and I'm Mia Darren Woods. Thanks so much for joining us. Sorry, you couldn't be here in person. Uh We were hoping to do this in person but the snow got in the way. It's good to be with you all. I appreciate you accommodating the, the weather. Yeah, the, the, the snow was here, by the way, not there in Texas. That's right. Look, I, I want to start by asking you the big question, the kind of meta question there are a lot of people out there who believe that that an oil company like Exxonmobil making hundreds of billions of dollars off of selling oil and gas. And a CEO like yourself who's making tens of millions off of that business can't possibly be serious about addressing climate change. Tell me why they're wrong. Sure. I would start with the premise that we're an oil company. I think, you know, as I've taken this job and focused on what's made us successful over the 140 years that we've been in business, it's come down to our ability uh to take technology and develop products that meet society's needs. So at our heart, we're a technology company, maybe a little different than some of the technology companies are out there today and that we basically focus our technology on transforming molecules and they happen to be hydrogen and carbon molecules. And so while uh today, a large part of that, uh that technology goes to making products that are combusted, we also have one of the largest chemical businesses in the world that makes a variety of products that go into uh into society that basically supports modern living. And so our view is our job is to basically take our capabilities in this space and address the needs of society and as those needs evolve. So do our business. I mean, one point I always make Allen is if you go back to the beginnings of our company, we started basically making kerosene to replace whale oil for lamps, electricity came along. Uh Ford Motor came along, started building cars, we started making gasoline. Uh during the war, we started making beetle rubber. And so as the needs of society have evolved, so has our company and they all come back to our ability to, to manage these molecules, these hydrogen carbon molecules. And so as we look at the transition and the next wave of things that society needs, which is a lower emissions uh world that to decarbonize the, the, the society that we have today. The question that we've asked ourselves is how can we bring our capabilities and skills to bear on solving that problem? And I'm pleased that, yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry, I was gonna say I I'm today, you know, if you go back a little bit in time, the only answer was when solar and EVs which clearly have a role to play and are necessary, but they're not sufficient. One of the things I've been pleased with uh with the Biden administration is the recognition that there's a broader set of solutions needed, a set of solutions that involve the molecule side of the equation as well as the electron side of the equation. Since we're in the molecule business that opens the door for us in carbon capture and storage, uh biofuels hydrogen, a number of opportunities in that space which we now can contribute to as that need grows. And as the markets develop, we, we want to talk about all those things. Today, we want to talk about hydrogen biofuels, what you're doing in lithium, what you're doing in carbon capture. But I do think part of the reason that people are a little skeptical or a lot skeptical about this conversation is because of, of the history that your company has before your, your time as CEO obviously. But the history your company has in climate denial, misinformation. I'm, I'm, I'm old enough to remember Herb Schmertz uh and the, the information campaigns that uh that he ran h how do you address that? History? Well, I think we've been very focused on going forward and what are the opportunities for us to contribute in that space? I think some of the perception out there, we could spend a lot of time debating and arguing that was 3030 years ago. I mean, today the world has moved on, the, the understanding of this challenge has moved on. And I think for where, where we are today is how can we contribute to a solution set, not debate the past. And that's basically what we're trying to do is leverage our capabilities and solve for what society needs. It's no different than what we've done for the last 140 years. We're leveraging the same core competencies, same core capabilities and figuring out how we can use those to advance products that society needs. And frankly, I think today our strategy is pretty robust to whatever the future holds. However quickly the world transitions, our company's position basically contribute. So like a lot of other companies, of course, um you've committed to net zero within a certain time frame, you have a shareholder group that is pushing you to do more, to move faster um to cut greenhouse gasses. Can you talk a little bit about what you are doing and also why you feel why you're pushing back against this particular shareholder group? Sure, I I would just start in terms of our push back to the shareholder. Has nothing to do with the environment or ESG that's not the basis of our uh dispute with that shareholder. But I'll come back to that in a minute. Frankly, what we've looked at is again, with this view, we recognize the challenges associated with, with climate change. We recognize the need to decarbonize and reduce emissions and we're very focused on doing it. If you look at the progress that we've made and what we share in our, in our proxy every year is the progress that we're making with respect to reducing our own emissions. Our scope one and scope two emissions, we've committed to decarbonize to get to net zero in our permanent operation where we're rapidly growing production to demonstrate that in a world of uh growing production that you can reduce your own emissions. And we've got a net zero commitment, a plan to 20 by 2030 to get to Net zero. As you know, we've announced an acquisition of uh pioneer and we've committed to bring their Net zero pledge in 2050 forward to a net zero plan by 2035 we have significantly reduced our methane emissions. Uh We're basically working around the world to reduce our own emissions and then we're providing products to help uh third parties reduce their emissions. So we're starting a carbon capture and storage business. We have three commercial contracts with hard to carbonized sectors. A steel company, an industrial gas company and uh ammonia production company. Now we'll capture 5 million tons per annum of their CO2. That is the equivalent of all the EV sold in the US to date the impact of that reduction on just three deals that we've done. We've acquired Denbury, which is the largest uh CO2 pipeline in the US to act as the spine to allow us to capture more CO2. And so uh making significant progress there, we're building a biofuels plant up in Canada. Uh We've got plans and are developing the world's largest low carbon hydrogen plant that plant alone would basically meet 10% of the Biden administration's low carbon hydrogen ambition. Uh We got plans on when we're working through on that, that will produce low carbon hydrogen and ammonia to help third parties back out their emissions. And as you pointed out, we've got a lithium business again, tapping into our capabilities to understand the subsurface drill uh extract uh liquids. In this case, water extract a lithium from the water and reinject that uh water. It's a lower cost of production for lithium than that exists out there today. And it's a much, much lower uh environmental footprint uh than the current methods. And so we can have a domestic US supplied lithium source to go into this electrification effort. Uh That is more environmentally friendly and more cost effective. And so a number of things that we're pursuing and as the markets develop, we are in a position to continue to lean into that and to bring our capabilities and skills to bear. Yeah, I just want to ask you about that as the markets develop, sorry to interrupt. But, but, but that's an interesting point. I mean, the question is, you know how much of this investment in alternatives is enough? Some people will argue that the European oil companies invest a larger share of their total investment dollars in in renewables than Exxon Mobil does. I mean, how, how do you decide what the right amount of effort is to drive this transition? I think that's a hollow argument. I think the first thing I would point to when you look at the levels of investment is you, you're comparing investments in wind and solar, which are technologies going into an established market with an established demand and an established pricing structure uh that's regulated and people get returns And so our view is we don't bring any real capabilities to that space. Those are, that's the electron solution that I mentioned. We don't bring capabilities other than a checkbook. And so we don't see the ability to generate a above average returns for our investors. And so we, while we recognize the need for that, we don't think it's an appropriate use of Exxonmobil's uh capabilities. We're focused on areas where there aren't solutions where we're going to decarbonize, help decarbonize harder to carbonize industries where today they don't have readily available solutions that wind and solar won't be effective at meeting their needs. So we're, we're basically concentrating our effort in that space. We're starting businesses from scratch. So I think when you look at the investment level, you have to look at it in the context of what is the opportunity set that you're investing in. We're building businesses from brand new. It's going to take time to get those businesses up and going. But somebody needs to do that. And so I think that the comparison of what we're investing in uh businesses that don't exist today versus people who are investing in businesses and sectors that do exist is a false comparison. Likewise, it's false comparison to say we're going to look at the oil and gas industry, which is an enormous industry with enormous demand and look at what you're spending in that space versus what you're spending in an area where there's basically nothing exists today. Again, a false comparison with time. If the market develops and grows and and replaces traditional energy system, my expectation is our investment will be just as big there. But we're at a much earlier part of the development curve in that space. And that is reflective of the investments we're making. I just give you one fact Allen, if you look at what we are spending in reducing emissions, it's the equivalent on an annual basis of one third of what the EU sepa spends to manage the uh environment for the whole of the US. I mean, that's a substantial amount of money for a company going into a sector in a bus, a value chain of business that doesn't exist today. And Darren, just to, I go back real quick to the shareholder question. I know you wanted to address that. Can you explain a little bit of you said push back is not because of the efforts and the plans to, to cut greenhouse gasses, but I what's going on? So make maybe just a little bit of context for that. You know, over the last 10 years, we've had 100 and 40 shareholder proposals submitted about half of those are from activist investors or activist shareholders. And I would make the distinction between the activists versus investors in our company and the difference. The key difference is the activists don't have an economic interest in the outcomes uh that they're proposing or in the uh returns that the company generates. Uh of that uh half of those uh proposals that have been submitted, roughly half of those have been submitted by just three activist groups. And so uh these individuals, while we talk about, we are, we are, I would tell you as a company very, very focused on shareholder rights. In fact, we like small shareholders. We've prided ourselves on the fact that our company has a very large base of small shareholders and we work really hard to keep them engaged and to bring them to the table and to exercise their rights and to, and to voice their concerns and their and their views. Uh We have a uh extensive outreach program. We try to bring them into the annual meeting so that I would say that we recognize the importance of the shareholders voice and wanna cater to the shareholders who are real investors who have an interest in seeing this company successful in generating return on their investments. We feel feel a huge responsibility to that. We don't feel a responsibility for activists that hijack that process, a legitimate process and frankly abuse it to, to uh advance an ideology that's inconsistent with the well being of the company. And I would tell you in this case for our June of capital and follow this. First of all, both of those proponents have publicly expressed the desire to basically diminish Exxonmobil's business and to stop the production of oil and gas. That's contrary to the, the benefit of most of our shareholders. Um They have um submitted this proposal in the past. This is the third time it was submitted last year when it was submitted, it got just over 10% of the vote under sec rules that that proposal should be, that proposal should be um excluded if it doesn't have, didn't have 15% of the vote. But the S ECs interpretation of that has led to uh basically allowing these proposals to come in time and time again. So the shareholders have reviewed that and have spoken on that topic and their scope three target, their, their proposal ask us to reduce SCOPE three, which is essentially the emissions of our customers and the way that we would have to do that is to reduce the sales of oil and gas. Uh So that's getting right into the heart of what we're doing. And our, the uh follow, this has been very clear that their objective is to get us to stop selling oil and gas. Uh That's basically what we do as a business. And so you've got a proponent getting right into the heart of the business sec rules should exclude that as well as ordinary business. And it is micromanaging. And so we're taking issue with the fact that the sec its interpretation of the current regulation is allowing this to abuse and we're looking for relief from that abuse, which we think is actually in the best interest of all of our shareholders and, and, and by the way, the best interests of society, I mean, stop oil and gas is not, not gonna be good for the world at this point in history. You're absolutely right. If you think about what we sell, we sell LNG, every ton of LNG we sell, basically backs out of coal, uh coal burning somewhere in the world. Typically, we're sending our LNG out to, to uh uh Asia. And so, you know, today there is an advantage to the products that we sell and, and by the way, the money that we're using there and the capabilities that we've built doing that we're now using for the transition. And so I think it's, you know, you, you don't want to force you, they're working a supply issue when the problem is in the demand side of the equation. And we're trying to balance the two, be the most responsible operator. So that as long as the world needs these products, you've got a company that you can rely on to do it, environment as environmentally friendly as possible as we continue to work for opportunities to diversify and decarbonize Mahal. I just wanna quickly follow up on that though. So you're saying that follow this and Arjuna are very different than say Engine One. I mean, Engine One was referred to as an activist when they came after your board. Yeah, I think again, this is, that's completely, that's, that's another I'd say kettle of fish, so to speak. Uh Engine number one basically was out to make a name for itself. Uh It did not have a specific agenda uh for Exxonmobil and to change at Exxonmobil other than to bring new directors onto the board, I would point out Alan if you look at Engine number One, while they were successful at bringing uh three directors onto the board, and those three directors came in without an an an engine one agenda, but more of an agenda to make sure that the company could be as successful as possible as we spent the year that they came in getting them briefed up on our strategy. Uh The basis of our strategy, why we were making the decisions that we were making when it came time to approve our plan that year in November, all three of those activist investors endorsed our plan 100%. And as we reviewed the strategy and rolled our strategy out that was endorsed. And so I would tell you maybe contrary to the, the perception out there, bringing those investors, those board members on that were keenly focused on making sure Exxonmobil was doing all it could to be successful and having them conclude that yeah, we were and that the plans that we had in place and the strategy we had developed was exactly doing it basically strengthened our board and their resolve for us to continue down the path that we were on. And so it's been a, a benefit to the company, maybe contrary to, to reinforce the path that we are on, contrary to maybe what many people thought out there. And we should note, um I think some of these same groups are also um you know, pushing for similar things uh at other companies. It is not Exxon Mobile specific. Um It's also at Shell and, and, and uh let, let me ask you a question that, that draws on your technical expertise and your analysis. Uh because you're now heavily invested in all sides of this transition. You see what's happening in hydrogen, you've made this big investment in carbon capture and storage. Uh You're now an investor in lithium. So you're part of the uh electrical economy. How long is this going to take? What is 2050 anywhere near a realistic goal? And if it's not 2050 when is it going to happen, what does your analysis show? So I'll start with the end and, and work my way forward with your question. And frankly, I don't know when the end is gonna come. I think 2050 from what you see today, what's being done today, the infrastructure investments that are being made. We're not on the path to 2050. I think most objective analysis would tell you that uh we've waited too long to open the aperture on the solution sets in terms of what we need as a society to start reducing emissions. And we're not investing nearly enough in the technology. Today's technology will not solve this problem. Uh And the reason is uh there's a cost issue here and if you look at the the solutions being offered, the the you know, the dirty secret that nobody talks about is how much is all this going to cost and who's willing to pay for it. And if you look at the policies that are being put out the way the governments are advancing this, the cost is very implicit, it's not an explicit cost. Now, we have, we have tabled proposals with the US, governments and governments around the world that there are mechanisms to get out there and start down this path using existing technology. But you need to make the cost transparent and the people who are generating the emissions need to be aware of and pay the price for that for generating those emissions. That's ultimately how you solve the problem. The issue today is it's too expensive. People can't afford it and they know governments around the world rightly know that their constituents. We'll have real concerns with that. And so we've gotta find a way to get the cost down to, to grow the utility of the solution set and make it more available and more affordable so that you can begin this transition. And so today, I would tell you, uh, we're not on that path. Uh, the policies that are being put in place aren't aggressive enough and don't incentivize the right kind of actions to, to be successful here. But if not 2050 win. I mean, what do you, what path are we on? Where? Tell me Allen, when, when is, when are people going to be willing to pay for a carbon reduction? Because today we have opportunities to make fuels with lower carbon in it. But people aren't willing to spend the money to do that. There are businesses aren't willing to spend it a week today. Make sustainable aviation fuel for the airline business, but the airline companies can't afford to pay for what it will cost to make sustainable aviation fuel. And so the challenge, when will they, when will it be economic? Are you saying never? This is the issue. This is, I think this is the value of the IRA which is you gotta start down, you gotta start with something you have to catalyze the work catalyze the investment, get started on the technology curve to see if you can uh innovate if all the technology and get the cost down. And I can't predict if we'll be successful in that space or not. What I can say is we haven't society as a whole, hasn't been doing enough of it and frankly uh society. And I'd say that the activists, the, the, the the dominant voice in this discussion have tried to exclude the industry that has the most capacity and the highest potential for helping with that some of these technologies. And so uh how quickly will the technology uh discoveries come? The innovation comes? How quickly can we scale those things? How low can we get the cost? I frankly can't answer that, but I do know there's a lot of work that needs to be happening today to make that uh give us a chance of success. I'll give you one example. We're investing in direct air capture. We're, we're using the technology that we have this molecule expertise that I talked to you about to figure out if there's new ways new technologies that we can use to directly capture carbon from the air. We've just built a pilot plan or prototype that we're, we're working on trying to cut the cost in half which by the way will still be too expensive. But we want to get down on that curve and there are a lot of companies out there trying to, to advance the technology in this space. How quickly will they, you know, will they succeed? I, I don't know the answer to that but Mahal just before we leave this, but you mentioned the Ira, you know, I don't think that's got nearly the, the attention that it probably deserves in this debate. You're getting huge subsidies to do that, aren't you the, the, the, the way that the government is incentivized and trying to catalyze investments, space is through subsidies. And the challenge you make the point, they are huge subsidies because the cost of doing this today is high. And if you're going to, if you're going to uh drive significant investments at a scale that even gets close to moving the needle, it's going to cost a lot of money. And so I think the government today is trying to incentivize that to get things moving. But I would tell you, building a business on government subsidy is not a long term sustainable strategy. We are not, we, we, we don't support that. Uh We're, we have committed ourselves to um use the IRA to try to get started on that. But at the same time, we're advocating to move to market market forces uh either through regulation prices on carbon. Different, there are different mechanisms out there today. The challenge with all those solutions that is the cost of that ultimately bears its explicitly bears itself in the price of products out there. And that's where the challenge comes. And so today you can, you'd rather just, you'd rather just have a straight tax on carbon. I think if you price car carbon, put, put a carbon price out there or regulate the carbon intensity of products uh that, that will drive the markets to start innovating and find solutions rather than having the government craft unique policy to incentivize different levels of investment in different technology spaces. I think, you know, that's I've accepted that as a, a bridge to get to an ultimate solution. But ultimately, the markets have to work in this space. If we don't get the markets to work in this space, we will not be successful as a society to, to decarbonize. So, um let's talk about an area where we have seen consumer behavior shift somewhat. Um The EV space and I know you guys are, we mentioned earlier, you mentioned a few times you're in the lithium business now. Um there's been a slowdown in demand though. So what do you see going forward in the EV space? And how does it impact you? Well, I would tell you. So, first of all, from our perspective, we don't, we, we, I don't have a view, I don't have a bias one way or the other. Again, it comes back to what does the market want. And we've always felt like from the very beginning when we were doing the analysis that, that people were extrapolating from very small sample sizes are very small, you know, data sets into this ev growth. So we never believe that, you know, just like any other product you're, you're moving through segment, consumer segments and tiers that as you penetrate those segments change and their motivations and abilities and desires, all that begins to, you know, so they're always felt like we're extrapolating too, too small of a set. So I felt like in the past, the projections were too high. And uh and I think we're projecting now, we've, we've had this, this lull and people now are kind of doom and gloom. And I don't believe that either. Frankly, I think, you know, my mind, we're planning for long term that the electric vehicles will have a role to play. Uh they'll penetrate uh to a certain level in society and the costs have to continue to come down. Our view is, you know, frankly, the reason we're in lithium is because we can provide our skill sets to a product that the, that the world's gonna need as we electrify, generally speaking, and battery usage goes up. And so we see long term demand for lithium. And then our view is we can produce that uh at a lower cost and more and more environmentally friendly footprint. And therefore there's an advantage that we can bring to that space. That's why we're interested in lithium trying to predict exactly what the sales are. I would tell you, I don't think we're any better than anybody else out there. I would just say we don't get too caught up in the hyperbole. We didn't get overly excited when people were saying it was gonna go through the moon and we're now not, you know, overly depressed that people are saying that the thing stalled and we're not gonna take, I think that the answers is somewhere in between there and society will figure that out. And our view is we'll be there with a product that that's gonna be needed to make that successful and, and you're able to, to extract it also from the United States currently and there's, there's even more that we're finding. So, um can you also kind of talk about what that means in terms of, you know, obviously, we're seeing across the board with manufacturing, uh a lot of incentives also to manufacture domestically. Um What does it mean for the company and, and for the country? So I think, you know, our, our, there's clearly this view that, you know, as you think about moving into new technologies, new products that you want to have a secure source of supply. Uh Our view is, and I think that's true with lithium, certainly true with energy and, and oil and gas in our business. And our view is, you know, I I think the right answer for any one country or one segment of society or, or business is to have diversified supplies. I would tell you from our perspective, it's not about making sure that it only happens within the US. It's really making sure that you have options and availability. You don't find yourself tied to any one single source of supply or dominated by a single source of supply that basically just like in business, you know, gives that supplier power and, and you wanna try to uh you know, not be found, found to be basically dependent on any, any one single entity out there. So I think domestic supply is important from that standpoint, we're not committing ourselves to domestic supply. We're really, this is a, this is a um an extraction process that I think again, it has a lot of benefits to what uh technology currently exists out there. One that we have a capability in, but it will be dictated in terms of where you do it based on where those resources reside. You gotta have a concentration of lithium in this brine water to make it economically feasible. The, the acres that we have in Arkansas that we're trying to develop, has that concentration makes it economically viable. And therefore we're developing that there are other opportunities around the US and around the world that will look to basically develop as well and pace that with the growth in, in the lithium uh demand and the supply that comes on. Uh Darren, I, I'd let you go back to this question of how long is this all going to take? Because I don't believe we've quite Alan needs a year. He needs a month and a day. I can't, I can't give that to you. I don't know the answer to that. But, but, but let me ask you this, uh I am 100% in agreement with you that we would all be better off if we had effective governments that could put a price on carbon and, and, and create a market that you could compete in. Uh that provides the right incentives to get us there. We don't have effective government. We're not, and we're not, we don't seem to be headed in that direction. Uh The IRA, as you pointed out, it may not have been the way you would do it, but it was a big, big deal. I don't know how many more things like that you're gonna get. So I guess the, the question I have for you is in that environment, what is the responsibility of Exxonmobil to push the market forward to push us towards a solution? Uh And how far are you willing to go in doing that? So I think, you know, this is the challenge we have uh a whole set of responsibility. One of is to advance technology, provide solutions that help society achieve its objective. That's clearly an object. We also have an objective and responsibility to our shareholders. We have to balance those objective sets. I think unlike a lot of activist groups and and ideologues that are out there who can focus on a single variable or a single cause. That's a luxury that we don't have. So we have to figure out how we can strike the right balance offer solutions that meet these growing needs, develop technologies. And we do do that. We have invested in these technologies. I I mentioned to you the direct air capture that we're doing. I mentioned the things that we're doing in carbon capture and stores. Those are all things that are very early in the stages that frankly today won't be viable long term uh businesses if society doesn't, doesn't start to put a value on decarbonization. And so to a certain extent, it's a little bit like exploration uh in our upstream business is that we see an opportunity we're managing and mitigating the downside uh and positioning ourselves for the upside. I think that's the most that you can ask for a public company out there. But how much of how much of an effect of the, the IRA subsidies have on, on your business? Oh I I would tell you uh if you, if you look at the lithium business, there's an established market and price out there. So it's not directly part of the IRA subsidies, but it is driven by evs which are part of the Ira subsidies and so indirectly the subsidies are behind the lithium business, the carbon capture and storage business. I would say the incentives to do that are all driven through the government, the the low carbon hydrogen. Again, uh there's not a market out there to sell low carbon hydrogen to a third party without the government subsidies, uh biofuels that we're investing in, in, in Canada as an example, are driven through regulation. And so I would tell you today, there's not a viable market where uh consumers step in and are willing to pay a premium for low carbon products. That's the reality of what we face today. I get, I can't drive demand and I can't, I can't make customers pay more for a product that has uh less carbon in. So you're a fan of the IRA. Our view is it's, it's an important bridge to get things started. So my mind is, yes, you gotta have, the government has to play a role. I would have used, I would have had the government play a different role. But to the extent that's what they chose to, they make the political decisions. They're answerable to answerable to the people. I don't, I, I don't pretend to be uh I am answerable to my shareholders and investors not to the general public. So the government has its role, makes its decisions and that construct, we're trying to be a, a positive force to demonstrate that this can actually work. And to start down that learning curve, whether we'll be successful as a society with that remains to be seen. But to your, your, your broader question of when we don't know the answer to that, what we've been looking at are the signpost, what has to happen in, in order for us to get onto this path. And so we have a very active um a process of monitoring um you know, investment in infrastructure. You know, if you're gonna electrify the whole country you, you gotta have transmission systems and distribution systems. Do we see the permits going into those things? Uh Do we see the advances in scale technology? There's a lot of things that we're watching. Do you see a market developing many, many things that we're looking at? And frankly, if you look at those sign posts, you don't see the activity. And I would tell you, my view is we got to move away from our governments and politicians talk talking in aspirational terms and uh building um the narrative based on hope and roll your sleeves up and start doing some real math here about what's the, how are we gonna get from where we're at to where we want to go to? What's it gonna take? How much is it gonna cost, who's best positioned to do that and actually start building a, a feasible plan that balances all the competing forces out there rather than ignoring the constraints and challenges and focusing on the hope and aspirations that in my mind will never solve the problem. And we're not doing enough of that as a world as, as a society. I don't see many governments anywhere sitting down and actually tackling these issues and inviting the right people in industry and government to roll their sleeves up and start building a plan to accomplish what, what they uh what the world basically needs. That's a great sign post. Look for you. Tell me when that starts to happen. I tell you we're on the path. So he sang September 5th, I think 2050. We, we have been advocating, I, I tell you that we have volunteered with every government uh that we engage with that when they're ready to do that, we're ready to sit down and, and contribute our piece. I'm not, I don't pretend that we have all the answers. I just think that we can, we can contribute uh asking many other companies and when they're ready for a contribution, a serious contribution, a serious conversation, they wanna do real, they wanna bring the engineers to the table, use data and analysis to figure out how we solve it. We're here, we're there, we're ready. Uh And we've been volunteering to do that for some time now and I would tell you some countries, some countries must be doing that. Some countries are doing that as you go around the world. I would tell the US with the Ira. They've been, I would tell you very constructive discussions with the US administration around. How do you bring the Ira? How do you translate the legislation and the practical regulations that incentivize industry to do these things? And we're, we're bringing our perspective again, I'm not suggesting that our perspective is necessarily the only perspective or the right perspective, but it is one that is based on a very deep understanding of our industry and the technical capabilities required to achieve some of these objectives. And so we're trying to be a positive constructive force here, positivity and, and, and constructive conversations uh with government between private sector and government sound like a pretty good thing. Um So we'll take, we'll take it. Um I want to ask you a question just about you and, and your leadership. Um You've been with the company for a long time. You are driving this transition and transformation currently, but I've seen it go through multiple changes over the decades and, and just give us a little bit of your take of, you know, what is the Exxon Mobil culture? How is it shifted and how is it not shifted? What, what are kind of the, the core, um you know, values or aspects of the culture that you feel like are really consistent. I think a lot of people don't know this, but I don't know anything about it. No, I think you're right. I think, and frankly, I, I, as I came into this job, one of the things that I guess upset me the most was that the perception of our company doesn't match the reality of the people who are in it and the hard work they do uh every day. And so one of my objectives is to basically try to help the outside world better understand our company and the people that work here and the work we do. And I would just point to, you know, probably the most explicit step that we took was the, I don't know if you um the C NBC uh engagement that we had with David Faber, where we, I invited him to come in and all I asked him to do was be objective. Uh And we gave him access to anywhere he wanted to go talk to any people in our company. And my view was if people on the outside got to see who we were, what we did and how our people approach their jobs, that that would start to um change some of the perception, recognizing it's a very long road to go on. And so that was the first effort. But if you ask, we have a set of core values and one that I've grown up with, they haven't changed. Uh We're trying to express them more effectively externally, but I would start with one that's I think for me has been critical for my entire career. In fact, what's brought me to this company is integrity, not just being honest and ethical, but uh being intellectually honest and saying the hard things and taking positions on what we believe on based on the facts and not jumping on bandwagons or subscribing to popular narratives. If we don't believe those are the right things, I would tell you a second, really critical um value for us is courage of conviction is that once you figured out the right thing, once you've done the assessment and you've got an answer. You've got to stand up and talk about it, you can't be afraid to go against the conventional wisdom. And I would tell you in this job, certainly, I felt the, the, uh the pressure to conform and I know what it feels like to stand against the, the popular narrative. But our view is if you've done the analysis, right? If you, if you have done it objectively, if you're not letting your emotions bias your thinking, but instead are kind of coming back to what is it gonna take to be successful for the long term that ultimately things come back around? Uh And, and you're proven that the path was the correct one. And then the third uh one that I would just mention is, you know, resilience that you, you gotta be in this for the long haul and you've gotta stand the pressure. And I would tell you, uh you know, those three of our five core values that we talk about with all of our employees. And, and so when you come here, we, we're not, we're not promising an easy uh career, but we're, we're promising a rewarding one and one that you can feel good about the first job I had in this company long time ago. Uh My first supervisor had gave me two pieces of advice that I've lived with since that time. And the first one was if you're ever doing something that you'd be embarrassed for your mother to read about on the front page of the paper, stop doing it. And I have lived with that my entire and that is really good advice. And the second one he told me was every morning you gotta get up and look yourself in the mirror and make sure you like what you see. And I just would tell you, you know, do, do the right thing for the right reasons in the right way and uh the rest will come with it. And so, I mean, that is, I would tell you, you go across, we have very committed people focused on uh doing the right thing in the right way for the right reasons. And um and they're making a difference and we have made a difference. If you look at our industry, I think it's hard to point to any industry that has uh progressed human living standards around the world. And uh we take great pride in that, but we're not, we're not um buried by that or married to that idea. The idea is that the world changes, things evolve. We've got a capability. Our job is to continue to contribute to society and basically help people uh achieve prosperity to improve living standards. And our, our people take great pride in our ability to do that. And we are, you know, going through a transition, but it will be a long one. This people don't fully appreciate the scale of the industry that we're in today. And so I think, you know, the recognition back to your question now about how long will it take? You gotta come back to the size of the existing energy system today? It is big, it will take time to replace. But my point is we gotta get started on it. But I would say, you know, I can't believe you, you voluntarily went back to Allen's question. I'm a g for punishing. What can I say? The, the, the other thing, Darren, I, that, that uh uh that uh notion that you don't want to read anything and you don't want your mother to read anything in the paper. It sort of depends on what paper she's reading too. My mother is not a good litmus test for that, by the way because she thinks her son does no wrong. So, but I just, I would just finish up the, those three I gave you the two more kind of our core values. Uh One is care, care about what you're doing and why you're doing it. And um uh care for the people that you work with, the communities that you're in and the environment. Uh we feel very strongly about that. And I think if you had the chance to be one of our operations, you would clearly see that. And the, the fifth one that we hold ourselves is excellence that we hold ourselves to a high standard. We expect a lot of ourselves and of our people. And when we don't uh meet this, this high expectations, uh we challenge ourselves to get better and those are the five core values I think, uh most everybody in our company, uh believe in and, and resonates with them. But I, but I wanna say we appreciate the fact that you have taken a different approach towards conversing with. I wouldn't say the public with the media on these things. I really appreciate the fact that you've come, uh, here today and spent so much time with us on, on this issue. I just have to ask you, I mean, this is a big, complicated, difficult transition. You're under a lot of, uh, pressure, a lot of pushback that you've talked about. What do you do to relax? I mean, do you watch Hallmark movies? Do you, I mean, what, what, you know, I have, uh, the, I have a, a lot of, uh, I put a lot of priority in my family. And so, uh, that's probably what I would tell you. I've never brought work home to my family. I try to keep them separated from the things I do day in day. And so when I come home, we, unless I want to, which is very rare. Uh, we don't talk about work. Uh, we talk about, you know what's happening in their lives. I've got three kids, I've got three grandkids, got another one on the way. And so I've, when I'm not at work, uh, I'm with the family and, and I, I try to get away and, uh, I like to go outside. We spend a lot of time outside. Uh, I've got some, some property in the hill country of Texas. I like to get away from. So I think getting clear my mind and I don't get too weighed down. I try to disconnect from the world. I'm not a social media guy. I'm not on the internet all the time. II, I just feel like that, uh, your Children, your Children and grandchildren aren't harassing you about why you aren't going faster to, uh, deal with the energy transition. I think my, my grandchildren are too young to that. We'll see when they get a little bit older than my old. The oldest is four. So I think she's not quite up to that argument yet. But, you know, I given how she is today, I'm pretty sure at some stage she gonna give me, she will give me a run for my money. But I think my kids, they know they know, uh, what I stand for. They've grown up with me. You know, we've always believed in sitting around the kitchen table. And so despite long work hours, my wife and kids always accommodated that we always sat down for dinner when I was in town and I would tell you our dinners were always long and we always talked and always challenged them. You know, my gift to them is independent thinking and listen carefully, understand what people are saying, but make sure that you make your own decisions and you have a basis for doing that. And I think over the years, I don't, can't think of a topic that we didn't, we haven't touched on and, and discussed. So my, my kids know why I do the things that I do and they know, uh, you know, the, the company that I work for and represent is very aligned with those principles and the values that I have as an individual. And so, uh they know they know what I'm doing to try to help solve this problem for the world. Well, Darren, thank you so much for sitting with us, as Alan said, we really appreciate you taking the time and, um, telling us so much about the company, both, you know, the transformation, the culture and, and all of it. Thank you. Happy to do it, enjoy the conversation and, uh, look forward maybe seeing you sometime in New York.","hideTranscript":true,"createdAt":1709044376934,"updatedAt":1709072475176,"irisTag":"leadership","sponsorTag":"LeadershipNext","isSponsored":true,"videoPublishDate":1708992000000,"duration":{"unit":"seconds","value":2653},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"fortune":true}},{"videoId":"3e532e9c-c879-46cf-82af-cd3e713badc1","name":"Fortune 500 shows energy took a big hit in 2020","slug":"fortune-500-shows-energy-took-a-big-hit-in-2020","shortDescription":"ExxonMobil is at its lowest spot ever on the list.\n","longDescription":"ExxonMobil is at its lowest spot ever on the list.","seoTitle":"Fortune 500 shows energy took a big hit in 2020","seoDescription":"ExxonMobil is at its lowest spot ever on the list.\n","socialTitle":"Fortune 500 shows energy took a big hit in 2020","socialDescription":"ExxonMobil is at its lowest spot ever on the list.\n","tags":[{"name":"UnitedHealth_Group","label":"UnitedHealth Group","type":"tag"},{"name":"Fortune_500","label":"Fortune 500","type":"tag"},{"name":"McKesson","label":"McKesson","type":"tag"},{"name":"AmerisourceBergen","label":"AmerisourceBergen","type":"tag"},{"name":"Healthcare","label":"Healthcare","type":"tag"}],"categories":[{"name":"Digital_Features","label":"Digital Features","type":"category"}],"section":{"name":"Franchise_Lists","label":"Franchise Lists","type":"section"},"playlists":[],"premium":false,"adsAllowed":true,"originalImage":"https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/3e532e9c-c879-46cf-82af-cd3e713badc1/Images/posterImage-ver3.jpg","resizedOriginalImages":["https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/3e532e9c-c879-46cf-82af-cd3e713badc1/Images/posterImage-ver3-1280x720.jpg","https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/3e532e9c-c879-46cf-82af-cd3e713badc1/Images/posterImage-ver3-640x360.jpg"],"originalImageDescription":"Photo illustration by Fortune","resizedSocialImages":[],"hlsFormat":{"extension":"m3u8","videoId":"3e532e9c-c879-46cf-82af-cd3e713badc1","type":"hlsFormat","version":3,"key":"3e532e9c-c879-46cf-82af-cd3e713badc1/HLS/video-ver3_master.m3u8","status":"complete"},"srtFormat":{"extension":"vtt","videoId":"3e532e9c-c879-46cf-82af-cd3e713badc1","type":"srtFormat","version":3,"key":"3e532e9c-c879-46cf-82af-cd3e713badc1/SRT/captions-ver3.vtt","status":"complete"},"transcript":"it's hard to imagine inventing a scenario for oil and gas demand in particular.

The big thing that happened was that Exxonmobil lost more than $22 billion. Exxonmobil falls to its lowest point ever on the Fortune 500 list this year.

I want to ask the first question actually to all of you who are on the call uh, in this room and if you could just put in the chat function right now, um, a corporate doors, if you are on a corporate board, tell us what board or boards you are on. And if you're not on us, if you're not on a corporate board, let us know if you are or if you're looking for another one, let us know if you're looking, let us know if you're on the hunt. This is the perfect place to show up and be seeing. So let's get into boards dealing with crises. This is a, this is a question up for grabs. Um, one key lesson that you have learned while serving on a board dealing with the crisis. Who wants to, who wants to answer that first. Okay, let me start. Um, obviously this is a, this is a crisis of all crisis. We've learned anything. It's just the time to apply it. One of the things that I learned in the plant in the past, I still focus on and and realize so much during this time is that um, what were therefore ultimately support of a good leadership team and this is not the time to go too deep into any area except for really deep in supporting the management team and listening and making sure that you have your ears Attuned to what their needs are. This is not over inspection. You know, tell me about your strategy 50 different times. I need 50 different presentations. This is a time when you need to pay attention to the team and ensure that they're paying attention to the details. That's number one. The second is that spending is just about everything and we talked about it a lot and other times we actually have sessions that we go off for days to do it. This is the time when we should actually test against all of this work that we do when it's not really too urgent to see whether or not we're aligning ourselves really against the strategic elements that the company and the board has worked on to develop, so stay far enough away to give them space to do their work and then actually focused on the strategy. I agree with all of that, I'll add um I'll add to uh and very similar to Ursula's, which is things that are core to what a board does coming, really coming into focus in a crisis. Um one, all the risk management activities that aboard undertakes during the course of its regular functioning, uh whether it's, you know, scenario planning, ranking, risks, adjusting for risks, making sure that you've got a healthy balance sheet in case you need it. During a crisis, these become the importance of this kind of activity becomes so obvious. And then the second, which really is the first succession planning and identifying and putting in place the right ceo and leadership team. Uh, because it is during a crisis that you see how very, very important that is. And I would agree. I mean, um, speaking of, uh, somebody who's serving on a university board and healthcare board in the middle of code, but it's been interesting. Um, and, and, and also advising a lot of companies over the years when they face different crises, The one word that came to mind when you asked that question patty would breathe, You know, hey, bruh, you know, this is the time. It's worthless that I completely agree with. Excellent. To use the board members need to step back assess the situation. Be supportive of management asked a lot of questions, listen carefully, listened intently and then help management on the journey and support them on the journey as opposed to trying to drive. Yeah, that's not your role. I'll add one. That is something that I learned during this. Coming from a big company like Mcdonald's and so many of you are on big company cash is not as big of an issue when you're on a small company and business shut down. Like in retail, there is no cash coming in necessarily. But yet you want to pay everybody. I mean literally every day, if not every few days you're watching cash berg and trying to do everything. You can, you see all the companies that are finally bankruptcy during this time, never thinking prior to that, you would have that kind of problem. And so I think that you learn a lot from it and you end up being a leaner, stronger, more focused organizations. So this year every every company, all of your boards I assume are dealing with the ramifications of covid uh whether that means turning to directors and getting advice on how to deal with, you know, the workforce issues or um potential bankruptcy or you know, balance sheet issues or workforce issues or whatever. How as board members outside of the outside of the regular board meeting. What kind of council can you give? Can you, can you take us inside? I know you're limited but can you, can you talk about how you are there for ceos and chairmen as advisers outside of the board meetings? I'll go first since I went last on the last one. But you know, a lot of it is just being available to talk through things. You know that may not need the whole board. I can tell you that, you know, certain board members of ours that were really great with banking relationships helped on, you know, from a cash standpoint, those of us that were closer in with, you know, employees helped, you know, manage through employees and and how that went. So I think that you end up doing more counseling, coaching, supporting, and just being there. So they have someone to talk to any Ceo is going to tell you it's one of the loneliest jobs there is, and when they have board members that they can trust, they end up calling on me that and and that that really has been the case in in my boards as well, you know, where you've got one of the reasons you go for diversity of experiences and backgrounds uh on a board is so that you can draw on those experiences, Well, in this particular case, you're looking for individuals who, uh, know what's going on in terms of the financial markets. Whereas, you know, what is going to be happening in terms of availability in, in commercial, uh, for commercial capital versus capital. That may be available from the government if you need it. Uh, what's happening in, in the pharma space? Uh, you know, what is, what is the, uh, in the beginning, we didn't know anything about the pandemic. We didn't know anything about covid. Well, if you had people on your board who actually knew something came from the health, uh, space, they were very much plugged in long before, quite frankly, the government was telling us what was going on. And so that was invaluable. So it really was individuals and individual skill sets and what they brought to the table. Um, that was really invaluable. Speaking of covid, um, there was a Reuters story the other day saying that companies with coronavirus outbreaks are encountering an emerging legal threat from claims that employees brought the virus home and infected relatives. Um, is this something that board members need to worry about? I mean, this virus is going to be around with us for a long time. And is this something that you and board members are, um, talking about worried about not overly. We definitely talked about. I mean, any legal, I think it's a yeah, I think it's always, I think it's always gonna concern. You're always gonna have ambulance chasers who are going to pulling together lawsuits and try to build class action lawsuits. I mean, if you look, for example, I mean, take a look at you. Take a look for example, in in um, uh, well, I won't name names, but a couple of of the facilities, the manufacturing facilities, of the two manufacturing boards that I'm on, they happened to be in communities with high covid spreads where it was very clear that the individuals and the communities were bringing covid into the factories rather than the other way around. Um, but the point is, you've got an obligation in terms of your safety mandate to make sure that your employees are safe in the factory. And so that is your focus and ultimately, the your, you know, the management team has figured out, How do you do that so that your workers don't bring it in with them? Uh, the answer is they're taking their temperatures at home now, right. And as you get, as you get faster coded tests available, they'll be able to do that at home rather than coming in, you know, coming into the office, but you know, just having a good safety set up and figuring out how you're going to work your way through this help. But yeah, the liability issue is a real yeah, it's the good samaritan problem that we unfortunately have in a, you know, litigation happy society. I think it's one of those things that you can't worry about the what ifs because always gonna do every M and a deal, but what you can do is make sure that you're putting in place actions like what Susan described so that when something does come up you can show we've done this, this and this. Um and I think that's where the board comes in and make sure that they've got protocols in place, but you don't spend time on that. So I think the case where the, as you guys are all saying, the best boards have a really good enterprise risk management framework, this should be integrated into that and talked about IT meetings um and in between is needed and it's where you really need to have a good general counsel who can help you understand when you've got some vulnerabilities. A challenge with Covid is this is such a shifting sand environment and the, you know, it just changes so quickly, hard to even anticipate what all the risks are going to be. Yeah, that's why I think just you know, Janet and Susan, this is a place where you can spend hours of the day of just wasting your time, waste time waiting to board time. There are operations managers, there are um legal people, they do their things run the company. I'm sure that they don't put the community because particularly if you have workers, they are the community at risk. And you know, and do your thing one is back to the previous question you asked about um advice. One of the things that I've gotten lots and lots of calls on and more from not my board members, but from outside, not my senior balls from outside Ceo is this idea of diversity a challenge for them to figure out what, what exactly does this mean? How seriously should we be taking this? Obviously they get the emotional side of the seriousness kind of But it has Since George Floyd, I've probably gotten 60 phone calls the day of God Florida was flying back home. I got 21, different ceo and it's all around. I thought I had understood what was going on, but I obviously, and listen, because the uproar is a little bit more than I was able to catch up with or more than I expected. So it was that that was it was not on pandemic, I'm on I'm on the hospital board, Mayo clinic and the university board M. I. T. Saying those they have different issues recipe actually have real live every day. They have a health worker to have but the companies were kind of okay moving along that it's some of these other ancillary quote unquote ancillary areas that people are step back a little bit and say saying how do I deal with this situation in today? I thought I was doing okay, but it seems like not so Michael Labrum has just joined us because all I see the questions coming in please look at the chat also everyone because there are people putting in articles, links. Um but just before we go to the questions um this is very important, we do want to focus on this. Um, we will get to other questions. I just want to cite a couple of numbers from Heidrick and struggles that I cited in yesterday's session to Ursula's point. Um, last year, 44% of director seats on the Fortune 500 went to women, But that progress for people of colour has been very disappointing. Only 10% of board seats went to black people, 5% to Hispanics and 88% to asians and asian americans. Now, Ursula, I would predict based on the reaction that you're talking about that those numbers will go up, the racial diversity numbers will go up a lot in the next 2, 3 years. Don't you expect that? But I don't think it's going to happen. The only reason why it's going to happen is because you, all of us on this call and me and people like us are not going to allow this game that's being played to continue to be played. When you speak about diversity, the comfort level first goes. So we'll get a white woman on that kind of people. They're like my wife, my sister. That's, that's again it. By the way, I want like I'm a woman too. So I like that. But it's a simple way out and helps to avoid one of the most difficult conversations we can have in this country and we continue to avoid it. And I think that the way that you don't avoid is that when you're sitting there as a woman, black or white or asian or whatever you ask about the rest of the people, you have nine people on the board, you're the woman and you look around and go to the eight men. What happened to the rest of the population? And I think we just have to continue to be, I say we're left click on this would let loose on this topic. Unforgiving and ask the question, why not? Why not? Why not? I was going to the other thing and the person said, well, the men who owned these seats are giving them up and they are going to really feel troubled about that. I said they owned the seat. I think that there's this belief that they own these things and they have to give them to other people is just not the way that so I think, you know, I'm on this all the time lately, but I just think we have to really stand for each other. No, I was gonna, I was gonna agree. And I and I do. I just sort of two thoughts on this one is there are a number of factors that are, are working in the favor of this. That predate George Floyd, that predate events of this year. And one of them has to do with, with tenure on Burns. You know, focus on tenure on boards, focus on the average tenure of board members and focus on getting diversity of and, and sort of fill in the blank on board. And I think that has contributed to. Um, and I'm aware of this in multiple cases, not just on my boards, but board members very politely, very nicely being asked to step down after a year, 20, years on the board. You're a really nice person, but you kind of, you kind of past your due date here and sometimes that's women too, by the way. But in a more frequently white men. And then the boards are looking around. And and I mean I hear I will talk about the four boards and I'm on uh, when we look at, you know, looking at the diversity on our boards, if you include women and individuals of color, you're talking 40-60% and if you exclude women 15-25%. Um, and and in some cases have gone north of that in the past, but it's it is an effort and it is a focus of non engulfed committees. The never it is never an accident. Um, when you have truly diverse, you know, when you've got truly diverse and inclusive boards. And and let me add just one thing the comments yesterday. Um, and you know, you knew this was coming patty the comments yesterday about having more and more electronic board meetings and less in person board meetings. I would argue that is the single worst thing that you could do uh in terms of bringing in more diversity and more inclusive boards. Because you end up going to people, you know, people you already network with, you will have less and less diversity in terms of succession, uh, and less and less diverse in terms of bringing in and bringing up uh new board members. So just just a thought because it's hard to get to know people you've never met before. Yeah, that's that's extremely interesting. We're gonna go to questions. I want to cite a hydrogen struggles fact. Uh, there is opportunity. Uh, Fortune 500 board average tenure of directors has fallen from 12.3 years in 2010 to 6 seven years in 2020. There is opportunity behold, let's let's get these plays. Got a few questions, Michelle. Why don't we start with you If you can just request to share your video and audio, um, we should be here in just a few seconds and go ahead and your question then we'll go to Lorraine next. It actually worked, isn't? How are you? I was just, I was just wondering since the topic was crisis. Um, let's see, Michelle sites is the chairman and Ceo of Russell and thank you patty. Um, let's assume you have a high functioning, high integrity collaborative board. Everything is working swimmingly. But what have you seen or what have you observed with other boards that you see as a systemic mistake that the boards make during a crisis. And what if anything can be done about those root causes? I think that's getting too involved in the week. one of the most important, the most problematic things that I've seen. It's so tempting to get very specific because most of the board members were operated before and I tell you what you can really do d focus the management team by by making your agenda, the agenda, making your interesting, your interest in whatever how many masks were handing out what we have the vaccine. All of these questions that are exactly what we want to know are things that I think can be that have you and you can see it in the management space. Who's your head down the past? We don't need help in that area. They need help in some other area and we're dragging them into areas. So I think this idea of hyper focusing on what seems urgent it is, but it's not really that critical is where we can really lose it. I Ursula, I think absolutely, that that is a huge issue. I also, the other thing I've seen is um lack of communication, lack of bringing the board along on the journey all group that's working with management through a crisis, but the rest of the board isn't informed or engaged in some way. You can lose them along the way and that that will create a crisis solved. I really want Jan and Susan both to respond to this question, this sort of systemic problem question. I mean Jan, you know, Jan is a true true core at her core and operator, I mean she started as a fry cook at Mcdonald's and rose to roast head of the whole. Mcdonald's U S A and and you are an operator, Jan and now you live your life as that your career is as a board member and uh speak to that issue of needing not to be an operator as a board man. I think the number one thing is, you know, even before crisis making sure that you have Ceo and management that you trust to leave in because when you have a problem that might a person that might be on the bubble, it's because a lot easier to try to get in the middle of it. So that's that's number one, you don't want to have to wait until the crisis for that. But I draw on my time in management and think when these people were trying to tell me what to do, and I was thinking, I, you know, I wish that they would stick with what they do best and let me stick with what I do best. So I I have been hypersensitive as a director to not get in the weeds because I had watched it myself. But you know, during a crisis, things happen and if you don't have confidence or if you think that course, but not to have the appropriate experience, then you tend to want to do more than what necessarily you really should be doing. So we need to, we need to bring up going here. Susan has been on the board of Boeing for how many years, Susan Uh, going on 10, 10. So there is, uh, I mean, filed just about a week or so ago, a shareholder a little over a week ago, a shareholder lawsuit is accused spellings board of directors of failing to properly oversee management responses to the two fatal, uh, 7 37 max crashes and, um, uh, in the plane safety problems and the huge hits to Boeing's bottom line as a result of that. Um, Susan, yeah. Speak to this, whatever you can about what you have learned by being on the Boeing board and going through this. Why? I'm glad we're not talking about specific boards that were affiliated with. Yeah. Um, I realize you cannot give her, you know, let me start. Uh well, it's kind of a tough question. No, I, I mean, I think I'm just I'm going to reiterate, I am very comfortable with, I am very comfortable with what going board has done throughout yes, um, crisis. And and it goes to a number of the issues that I've talked about, which is if you if you have done your job before the crisis, you're in a position to deal with the crisis. Right? So, um, I feel very strongly that the board did its job and uh, did his job in terms of risk management, did its job in terms of having the right people in place. And when there were issues, the board responded right, the board set up aerospace safety uh, committee that that a couple of board members who are unbelievably skilled in terms of skilled and knowledgeable in terms of engineering, in terms of aerospace safety, in terms of regulatory issues and safety. Um, they uh, did an intensive program and, and we now have a full time committee, but they also made some suggestions and I'm going to get into the weeds here. But having the chief engineer recording directly to know rather than having chief engineer reporting to program management right, uh, to the extent that that could have some implications. But, um, and, and when the board felt that, that there needed to be some changes in terms of structure, in terms of management, changes were made, I mean, I think, uh, this is a, this is probably the most qualified and on the ball group that I've encountered an issue having to do with communications. Um, uh, sad to say for a variety of reasons. There have been in the last two years, four different heads of communications at Boeing a long time. Head of communication happened to have retired, um, maybe, um, a handful of months before the first crash, and then we had a series of temporary ones who, for a variety of reasons, it just didn't work out. So ultimately, um, uh, in addition to bringing a new person in from the outside, we went outside for help, we wanted to know, um, you know, we went outside for help. So, uh, it's just a matter of you deal with the crisis that you have and um, in the case of Boeing, uh, we had a couple of board members who were as qualified, if not more qualified than anyone in management, um, or as qualified who could step in when you needed somebody to step in as Ceo. So Dave calhoun who is now Ceo, who had been head of G. E engines, step in as Ceo and uh, Larry Kellner, who had been, uh, Ceo of Continental Airlines has stepped in as chairman of the board. So luckily when we needed this to happen, we had board members who were that well qualified and that's how we're, you know, that's how it's worked. So it's a, it's been a, it's, you know, what would prefer not to have gone through this experience and what happened with the crashes is absolutely a tragedy. But to be honest, those airplanes, the max, the max was safe to get on a year more than a year ago. I mean, it was safe to fly more than a year ago. We just have to get through the regulatory process to get it back officially up in the air. Well, thank you for for sharing as much as you could. And that is really helpful and we're glad we're glad you are on the Boeing board. So, uh, I got a few more questions. I'm sure there was no easier for a quick way to answer that question. But let's go to Lorraine and then Wendy, we're going to go to you next. If you can go ahead and request to share video and audio as well, we'll get you in a minute. Did we lose ursula? She, we, we'll be right back. Okay. I'm Lorraine, Harrison. I'm ceo catalysts. And my question is how has the crisis influence the skill set that boards are looking for um, to handle it? And, and I think we should probably throw in, you know, the D. I. Uh, focus in terms of diversity. Is that changing the skill sets in any way in particular? Well, Bonnie is probably the best one and this one, so we're like, what are you looking for, barney, what trade, where you're looking for? Um Well, if if I think it's um underscored board interest in having operating skills, certainly people who have very senior level operating skills, health, health and wellness skills. Um We're definitely seeing an uptick in that on on the D. N. A front. It's actually been very very important. And I think um you're one of the statistics that patty didn't mention that was in our board monitor report last year. Is that 71% of the new directors were Ceo or CFO. And when you have numbers like that, you are not going to diversify your board Because that means 28% have to, you know, bring the diversity because most of the others will not. And I really think we're seeing a big shift. Their reports are starting to say, bring me really great thinkers who can work at a level of complexity and sophistication. But you can find that in any number of places. I think personally you talked about that the other day to brought you um you can find that the head of a Global NGO, you can find that in a rock star who is an operator at a very senior level, um a great emerging high performing company. There are a lot of ways to bring diversity into the table and we're seeing more clients. They're asking for that, I'd say the majority of our clients. And interestingly to your .2, we're seeing more clients now who are willing to um select directives without meeting them. They're doing zoom and they I mean we're referencing even more than we ever did and I think they're referencing as well. But they were they recognize this is a crisis. This is a moment when they if they are serious about diversity. This is the moment um to take it seriously and take those actions. And so that's the thing. More of that did I did I mention, I'm not sure if I mentioned, I mentioned it to a lot of people. This is why I can't remember that. To listen to leadership next. The current the Alan Murray, Ellen McGirt podcast this week is with Ursula Burns talking about this issue. So it's very good. Um let's go ahead and bring in Wendy to ask her questions when we, when we see you, can you introduce yourself, hearing? Yeah. Um Wendi Davidson, I'm president to be away from home business for the Kellogg company and I served on the first try to force their board actually listening in on the run and we'll have forward um, my question, you know, I heard some of the last couple of days is that the crisis is actually had a disproportionate impact on and minorities in really all sectors. And I'm curious what role boards can play in ensuring that this doesn't become a moment in time, it would set backwards, but actually propels us forward. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a great question. And if I feel more likely start, this is an area that we've been doing one of the other boards. I wanted to support foundation board and and if you know about the Ford Foundation, it's basic focus is on equality and boards have to actually get themselves um involved in the whole business of business and not in the past, it was pretty clear what we were focused on board members and as the ceo of the boys were focused on and that was a thing called shareholder returns. And it kind of has to happen in like 90 day implement and therefore your focus was hyperbolic towards that area and kind of you fit the other things in over the last five years or so. We've been able to shift that a little bit. I think that now with this entirely new world where we define workers, like check out people or the person who pushes your gurney as a critical worker, we should actually match the practices in our company. Board should actually ask the leadership to do this uh leadership to do with the words that we put around these people. So they're critical workers, you know, what do they live? How do they work? How do we pay them? How do we educate them? How do we incent them how? And in the past they will almost throw away people. The boards have to engage the entire company, not just the leadership team, not just the key sweep, you have to do the community, they have to work with all of the, look at all of their employees and they have to look at the social structure of the communities in which they do business and get money. So I think this is a hard thing because like I said that that first one is three quarters of no matter what we say, no matter how altruistic we want to be, it is three quarters of for for what most boards spend their time on and we have to actually started diversify almost what boards are doing that are selected or had it in a really interesting that the strange for you to hear this from me is Uber and the border of Uber and Uber actually, the Ceo Dara has actually positively surprised me across the board in this area. Part of the reason is that he has a set of supplier system that our drivers that are in the millions from all over the world. So you have to be kind of worried about these people deferentially than you would normally worry about kind of a third party, but just the flexibility of the company at this point to actually think through things differently. It's still a young public company and so therefore it can lay out some things very differently. Um and think about things differently in the board is open to that. So I'm very pleased with some of the progress that Uber is making, some of the old, some of the older companies that I'm associated with, particularly the non american, older companies, your company horribly barbara, very narrow it very traditional. It's very legal. So I think that they'll come along as well, but it's taking them a long time to get comfortable. We, uh, we do have a few more questions than patty. I know we're getting a little bit closer to, uh, times. I'm going to just read one here real quickly Emily. I don't know if Emily to, I don't know if you're still in the room, but I'm going to read your question out loud and it's a really interesting one. Any thoughts on strategies for dealing with activist shareholders to nominate non diverse board members, particularly with boards who has built a phenomenal pipeline of diverse directors and don't want those efforts guidelines. I don't think there's any difference in dealing with them, then you need, if they had a diverse candidate, I don't either. And I have to deal with that a number of times. And, you know, it's one thing for them to nominate one. But you know, our job is to make sure that we have a candidate that could, you know, exceed what they offer. So I think that that's, you know, it's not gonna be any different than before in the, when they put a candidate up, we put a candidate up and make sure that we've used Bonnie and gotten a great candidate that does have the diversity or the specific skills that we're looking for. Right, I have a couple more questions. Let me call. I do not. I know a lot of questions have come into the group. We want this to be as interactive as possible. So do you have other questions? We know quite a few. Let's do one more and then I'll turn things back over to you. Jamie Eddington had a question, what trade offs are each of you encouraging your board to make? Often people want someone with tenure board experience, which occasionally narrows the opportunity for diversity, for women of poor people of color. I'll take this one because I I care non governance and you have to be very aggressive about getting people to retire. It was mentioned earlier, they don't know that seat. Um at some point you need to push that and I'm having to do that right now, but also studying up, you know, the candidates that you think could fill that you start with a matrix. And I'd say, you know, bullets today, I could be wrong on this money, but you know, take advantage of recruiters to help you on that and see what the universe looks like. And I can tell you that there's a ton of people out there and they fit exactly what Ursula is saying. They can be a first time board director because you have nine other directors that are already on that board and have been so you don't need to be afraid if it's their first time, you want to make sure that they're qualified, that only has to be. But I think it takes a little bit more time. The other thing is, and it's kind of, it's almost um humorous to me in a way, but I pushed a long one to speed up because I said, everybody is gonna be looking for these great, diverse candidates. I want to be out there first and get one. So everyone is looking now. They know how important and critical it is and you don't want to be the last one. You want to have the best offering and um, you know, make it a priority. And then, like I said, you can worse opening in the worst case, you can always add to the number of directors if in fact, er, charter allows for it. I think one of the things that's happening now that is very uh, in some ways uh, comical is that States and some countries are mandating things, it's going to be interesting to see how fully these. I can't do it. The board, I have no space, I can't do it. There are no candidates. I can. All of these reasons, all these excuses literally go away. It's happening for women already. When that was when the UK said you needed to have out of nowhere appeared all of these qualified women sisters on the board, you California saying. So I say all this is an excuse to just not move people. The easiest thing to do is wait till the last minute, right before somebody hit you over the head for you to do it. Uh in order for this to make a change, we're going to have to be affirmative here. You're gonna have to be purposeful, you're gonna have to say, as you say, you know, I love it. You know, you're a little bit kind of 15-17 years. Maybe you should think about kind of moving along because we have somebody somebody two or three or four that can absolutely flattened right now who are diverse there, the Latin, next woman and a black man. We'll put them all in that we're not gonna miss anything, particularly if we do it in phases at the right time. Now you don't want to bring it for those. I just think right now we're all trying to figure out a way to do what is totally and completely impossible without doing it right? But I just say just we can make this happen. I mean this companies can make this happen. I just watched the U. K. And I just you know came not possible, we can't find them and look at what happened in literally a year and a half and I've lost massively checked. No company has driven itself over the over the click or into a wall. They're still being run pretty well in government. Yeah. I think Earth was totally right and and I think it's about accountability and and what I've seen over the years and sports when they hold themselves accountable then it happens. And one of the things we did about two years ago, as we as a firm took a diversity pledge and said that half of our board slate would be diverse whether our clients transport or not. And what happened we found Is that 66% of our placements in the last 12 months have been diverse and in part because if you good people and boards are holding themselves accountable, they will add them to the board because they're good people and they add a lot of value. Exactly. So you are getting bravos and here, here you be. So I will just say hear, hear bravo, J F P G S s and you be and all of you for joining fantastic panel, all sorts of good messages in this final minute. Uh, if you're looking for a board seat or if you're looking for directors on the board that your honor, the company's you're affiliated with. Do a quick look at the chat because there's lots of really good information in there.","createdAt":1601661877977,"updatedAt":1631043821257,"videoPublishDate":1601596800000,"duration":{"unit":"seconds","value":2718},"destination":{"onDemand":true,"connect":true}}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/company/[slug]","query":{"slug":"exxon-mobil"},"buildId":"KELQi5CnGmpaSxMRCXRAV","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"customServer":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html> contentType 9 text/html url 44 https://fortune.com:443/company/exxon-mobil/ responseCode 3 200

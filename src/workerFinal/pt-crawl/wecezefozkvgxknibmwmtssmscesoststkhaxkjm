<p>“Joe Pesci has never been better or scarier, the late, great Ray Liotta is a genuine revelation and De Niro is (as he always seemed to be at that time) superb.” <strong>Ben Stoddart</strong></p>

This year, for the fourth edition of the poll, we received ballots from 480 directors. This electorate spans experimental, arthouse, mainstream and genre filmmakers from around the world.

Ten years ago there were a thousand invitees; now I hear that number has doubled. An awfully big dinner table. And I'm not sure the guests will like the wine I've brought. Should I have included films from the silent era and more women directors? Gone from the current list are Ozu and John Ford – the oeuvre has long eclipsed individual works.

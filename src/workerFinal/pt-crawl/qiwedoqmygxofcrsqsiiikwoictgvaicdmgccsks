<P><I>The following two articles by William M. Fulton on finishing
violins first appeared in the May 1972 and July 1997 SCAVM Bulletins,
respectively.</I></P>

<P><I>Bill Fulton is one of the founding members of our Association
and was our president during 1968. He has been a regular contributor
to our Bulletin and has made many presentations at our meetings
through the years. He is well known for innovative and sometimes
controversial ideas such as terpene varnish, plate bending, and
the glazing method of finishing.</I></P>

<P><I>Bill took up violin making in 1951 while serving with the
U.S. Air Force in Germany. He studied with Willibald Raab, first
in Mittenwald, then in Erlangen. He retired from General Dynamics
in 1980. He is author and publisher of the books </I>Propolis

<H2><CENTER>TERPENE VIOLIN VARNISH</CENTER></H2>

<H3><CENTER>by William M. Fulton</CENTER></H3>

<P>There are only two materials required to make terpene (or turpentine)
varnish. These are linseed oil and gum turpentine.</P>

<P>The turpentine must be pure <I>gum</I> turpentine. The gum
turpentine is distilled from the oleoresin that exudes from the
living pine tree. It contains about 60% alpha pinene and 3035%
beta pinene. It is the beta pinene that is most reactive and will
form the terpene resin. Such products as wood turpentine contain
no beta pinene and therefore must be avoided.</P>

<P>Polymerization of the fresh turpentine will occur naturally
over an extended period of time. From six to eight months are
required during which time the turpentine must be exposed to air
and heat. The process is accelerated by the presence of moisture,
ultraviolet light, and heavy metal ions. I have found that the
process can be reduced to 25-30 days by forcing air continuously
through gum turpentine in the presence of manganese napthenate
acting as a catalyst. The process should be carried out in direct
sunlight if possible so as to receive heat and ultraviolet light.
The method I use is as follows:</P>

<H3><U>Equipment</U></H3>

<H4>2 clear glass 1-gallon jugs</H4>

<H4>1 small fish aquarium bubbler with tube attached</H4>

<H4>1 large plastic funnel</H4>

<H4>1 piece filter paper or cloth</H4>

<H3><U>Materials</U></H3>

<H4>3 quarts gum turpentine</H4>

<H4>15 cc 6% manganese napthenate (or Siccatif de Courtray, obtainable
from artists' supply shops)</H4>

<H3><U>Process</U></H3>

<P>Place 3 quarts gum turpentine and 15 cc 6% manganese napthenate
into a clear glass 1-gallon jug. Locate the jug in a place that
will receive direct sunlight during the day. Connect a bubbler
so that air is bubbled continuously through the mixture.</P>

<P>After several days (10-15) the mixture will change color from
dark brown to light straw. At this time filter the solution into
a clear 1-gallon jug and re-connect the bubbler. Continue bubbling
until the turpentine is very thick (20-30 days). The yield from
this process is less than 50% since a good portion of the alpha
pinene is evaporated.</P>

<P>The thick (polymerized) turpentine made by the above process
is no different from that produced naturally. The catalyst is
soluble in the fresh turpentine; however, it is insoluble once
polymerization has started and can therefore be filtered out.
It should be removed as completely as possible because excess
amounts of manganese in the final varnish can cause defects in
the dried film.</P>

<P>The thick polymerized turpentine must now be made into a resin
suitable for making varnish. This is the point at which the old
Italian varnish makers started since turpentine available to them
was &#147;aged&#148; and thick.<SUP>1</SUP></P>

<P>The thick turpentine is a mixture of many complex substances
derived from the terpenes. It is only necessary to evaporate the
volatile substances in a cooking process to free the desirable
terpene resin. Extreme care is required, however, since the mixture
contains some hydroperoxides. These substances are very unstable
and when heated change to acids with the liberation of considerable
heat. The reaction is very exothermic and the fumes are heavy.
The reaction begins at about 125 degrees Celsius and ceases when
all of the hydroperoxides are expelled. I use the following cooking
process:</P>

<H3><U>Equipment</U></H3>

<H4>1 electric hot plate</H4>

<H4>1 thermometer -10 to 400 degrees C</H4>

<H4>1 high wall 5-qt. pan</H4>

<H4>1 pail filled with cold water</H4>

<H3><U>Material</U></H3>

<H4>1 quart thick (polymerized) turpentine</H4>

<H3><U>Process</U></H3>

<P>Place the thick turpentine in a high wall 5 quart pan. Connect
an electric hot plate in an open <I>outside area.</I></P>

<H3><CENTER>CAUTION:</CENTER></H3>

<H4><CENTER>DO NOT COOK THIS RESIN INDOORS!!</CENTER></H4>

<P>Place the pan on the hot plate and gently heat observing the
temperature increase on a thermometer. At approximately 125 degrees
Celsius bubbling will occur. Use extreme care and as the temperature
increases be prepared to remove from the heat and cool by placing
the pan in cold water. Do not let the temperature exceed 150 degrees
Celsius until after the exothermic reaction has ceased. This can
be determined by a change in odor or by observing a more gradual
change in temperature. I find there is no danger in cooking the
turpentine if one proceeds slowly and if one does it out in an
open area. Cooking in an enclosed space or proceeding too fast
can cause fire and perhaps explosion with serious personal injury.</P>

<P>The resin must be cooked until it is brittle. The temperature
at which it is cooked and the metallic salts with which it is
cooked will determine its color.</P>

<P>To make <I>yellow</I> varnish required for a ground coat (one
that will not discolor the wood due to differential absorption),
cook the thick turpentine in a pan made of aluminum, stainless
steel, glass, or enameled ware and do not exceed 180 degrees Celsius.
Cook until brittle.</P>

<P>To make <I>amber</I> varnish, cook as with the yellow, but
continue to 300 degrees C.</P>

<P>To make <I>red-brown</I> varnish, cook in an iron pan that
has a film of iron acetate in it. This can be made by putting
a few cc of strong vinegar (glacial acetic acid) into an iron
pan and allowing it to evaporate. When the acid has completely
evaporated, add the thick turpentine and cook to 300 degrees C.</P>

<P>After cooking the resin to a brittle state, allow to cool and
break into pieces. The resin can be kept in this state until desired
for compounding the varnish.</P>

<P>The linseed oil used in this varnish is any good grade of boiled
oil. This material will contain a balanced mixture of dryers which
will not interfere with the varnish, but may aid in drying.</P>

<P>The turpentine varnish is made by cooking the terpene resin
with the linseed oil. The process is the same for all of the different
colors except the pale yellow ground coat varnish. To make the
pale varnish, cook the resin and oil in a ratio of 150 grams to
100 cc oil to a temperature of 180 degrees C. Hold at this temperature
for a firm pill.<SUP>2</SUP> With this varnish one may have to
cook for more than an hour or two to achieve a firm pill. If the
temperature exceeds 180 degrees C, the varnish will darken.</P>

<P>All other colored varnishes are cooked in the same ratio (150
grams resin to 100 cc oil) allowing 20 minutes to reach a temperature
of 300 degrees C. Hold at this temperature until a firm pill,
which will take 20-30 minutes. Cool the batch to 230 degrees C
and reduce with 250 cc volatile solvent for each 150 grams resin.
The yellow varnish is reduced in the same proportion (250 cc solvent
to 150 grams resin), however it may be added at 180 degrees C.</P>

<P>In the varnish industry the choice of solvent to use is dictated
by economic considerations and is usually a compromise between
price and quality. The old Italians had few solvents from which
to choose. The most logical was turpentine although most of the
available turpentine was oxidized or thickened. The resin-oil
mixture requiring a solvent is both polar and nonpolar. It requires
a polar-nonpolar solvent; however, the 5-10 day old straw colored
turpentine made with the bubbler, the product filtered and not
allowed to become thick, is a polar-nonpolar solvent and can be
used. Additionally, the following solvents can be used: oil of
rosemary, spike lavender oil, pine oil, and pine needle oil. All
of these substances were available to the ancients and are polar-nonpolar
solvents. For myself I use the thin oxidized (5-10 day) straw
colored turpentine.</P>

<P>To summarize the varnish formula we have:</P>

<H4>100 grams terpene resin</H4>

<H4>150 cc cooked linseed oil</H4>

<H4>250 cc thin oxidized turpentine</H4>

<P>Each of the colored varnishes except yellow and amber contain
iron salts. It is the iron that causes the salmon pink fluorescence
of the varnish under ultraviolet light. The ground coat exhibits
a gray color characteristic of terpene resins. Both of these indications
can be observed on the old Italian instruments of the classical
period.</P>

<P>The varnish is applied to a violin using a good quality clean
bristle varnish brush. There is no need to use the fine sable,
etc. brushes. The varnish will flow properly and form an even
thin coat. Each coat will appear dry to the touch rather quickly.
However, complete drying of the oil requires 2 or more days and
preferably in direct sunlight or an ultra-violet drying cabinet.
It is wise never to rush varnishing. After all, what are two or
three days in the life of a fiddle?</P>

<H3>NOTES</H3>

<P>1. Gum turpentine is in great demand by the chemical industry
for use in producing synthetic camphor and a wide range of polymerization
catalysts for the plastics industry. The price has quadrupled
in the past 5 years. It is used too fast to naturally change state
to the thick gummy material we desire for turpentine varnish.
The reverse was true during the classical Italian period.</P>

<P>2. To test for a firm pill, place a drop of hot varnish on
a cold glass plate. Allow to cool and probe with a finger. The
varnish should be about the consistency of taffy&#151;that is,
firm but not hard. It will form a thread as the finger is pulled
away from the pill.</P>

<H2><CENTER>PROPOLIS SOAP &#150; Used as a Ground for Violin Varnish</CENTER></H2>

<H3><CENTER>by William Fulton</CENTER></H3>

<P>To introduce the subject of the ground I use under violin varnish
let me present the following background:</P>

<P>In 1989 I attended the Tiverton Violin Conference in England
and heard a presentation by Claire Barlow. It concerned the results
of an investigation she had conducted on the ground that was used
by the classical makers. She revealed that the ground appeared
to contain something she described as &#147;rubble.&#148; Claire
was unable to identify what the material was, but she did say,
with some certainty, what it was not. Then in 1993 I attended
a joint meeting of the Violin Society of America and the Catgut
Acoustical Society and heard a presentation by Andrew Dipper where
he discussed a mineral ground that he and Geary Baese were investigating
in an attempt to reconstruct what Claire Barlow had discovered.
That is the background now for my ideas on this mysterious ground.</P>

<P>I believe this ground was based on propolis, a byproduct of
the beekeeping industry.</P>

<P>Back in the days of the old master violin makers, 1550&#150;1730,
people who kept bees didn't have the hives we have today. They
kept their bees in skeps, baskets woven of straw. Each year, in
preparation for the honey run, the beekeeper would clean the hive
by leaching it in lye, the result of leaching wood ashes with
water. (Today we scrape the propolis from the hive.) The lye would
digest the propolis making the hive ready for the bees. This digesting
process created a liquid soap from the propolis. It is my belief
that this liquid soap was the source of the mysterious ground
the violin makers used as an undercoat. (It was also probably
used by artists of the time to make a smooth, sealed surface for
paintings). Someone, be it the violin maker, artist, or perhaps
a person who was engaged in dying cloth (it gives a beautiful
gold color), would add alum (other metal salts can be used) to
the lye-propolis mixture, precipitating an aluminum propolis soap.
The resulting very bright yellow material, when washed, would
be a very fine slurry ready to use as a ground.</P>

<P>How did the violin makers use this propolis soap? Here are
my thoughts. The violin makers would scrape the surfaces of the
violin smooth with scrapers. (You don't have to worry about the
small imperfections caused by the curl of the maple picking out
or small imperfections such as tool marks, etc., because they
will be filled.) Then the wet slurry would be rubbed into the
wood leaving a coating of this bright yellow soap on the surface.
It is allowed to thoroughly dry and then it is rubbed, with the
hand, to a very smooth, almost silk-like, surface. The material
will fill all tool marks, all imperfections, gaps in the purfling,
but the grain of the wood will be completely hidden. Next, a coating
of clear varnish is applied and, if the index of refraction of
the varnish is correct, the wood grain suddenly appears and the
propolis soap will disappear. When dry, if there are any imperfections
in the surface they are repaired by rubbing with more propolis
soap and sealing with more varnish. This is continued until the
surface is acceptable. Then more varnish is applied, a color glaze,
and the instrument is finished.</P>

<P>This bright yellow aluminum soap actually seals the surface
of the wood. The varnish is absorbed by the material but the varnish
does not penetrate into the wood. When it is applied to the scraped
surface, the top appears like corduroy, but the material fills
the grooves of the corduroy, and the surface becomes smooth. After
varnishing the growth lines in the top are accentuated, look darker,
due to varnish being absorbed by the propolis soap.</P>

<P>Originally, when the skeps were leached in the lye, some organic
matter other than the propolis was digested, such as dead bees,
beeswax, etc. This gives a greenish-yellow color to the aluminum
precipitate. To get a bright yellow color the liquid soap was
allowed to stand until the organic matter formed a scum on top
which was subsequently removed (It actually rots to form the scum.).
Then a bright yellow color is produced when the alum is added.
Of course today we do it differently but the results are the same.</P>

<P>The reason I believe this to be the ground is because it is,
first of all, a very bright yellow, the color seen under most
old varnishes, and, second, it is a product that was readily available
to the violin maker.</P>

<H3>PROPOLIS SOAP TODAY</H3>

<P>Instructions on making propolis ground follow:</P>

<P>Fill a one quart glass jar half full of raw propolis as scraped
from the bee hive. Add enough acetone or denatured alcohol to
the jar to cover the propolis at least one inch. Allow the jar
to stand until the propolis resin has dissolved, approximately
2 weeks. Filter the solution into a glass drying pan and place
in a warm location to allow the acetone or alcohol to evaporate.
(Some residual solvent will not affect the process). Collect the
propolis resin.</P>

<P>Place 100 grams of propolis resin in a jar and add 300 cc of
water. Add 3 grams of potassium hydroxide and heat the mixture,
below the boiling point, to dissolve the resin; then filter the
liquid into a clean jar (There should be an excess of propolis
resin meaning all of the potassium hydroxide has been exhausted
by the reaction).</P>

<P>Make a solution of alum (aluminum potassium sulfate) and water.
A 5% solution is about right. Add this solution to the propolis
resin solution causing a bright yellow precipitate to form. The
reaction is complete when, upon standing, the precipitate settles
to the bottom and the liquid above is clear. Pour off the clear
liquid, add water and shake. Allow the precipitate to settle,
then pour off the liquid and add more water. Do this several times
to get rid of excess alum. Pour most of the water from the precipitate
and filter. Collect the wet yellow paste into a jar and cap. This
is the yellow mud that will be used as a ground.</P>

          <h1>Settling the Dead: Funerals, Memorials, and Beliefs Concerning the Afterlife</h1>

          <h2>LOOKING AFTER THE ANCESTORS: HONORING VIRTUE AND REPAYING MERIT&#42;</h2>
          <p><b>No ritual or institution did more to reinforce the solidarity  of the family system in traditional Chinese society than ancestor veneration </b>(also called &ldquo;ancestor worship&rdquo; or &ldquo;the cult of the dead&rdquo;), and none was taken more seriously  by both society and the state.<a  class="caption" href="#fn">(1)</a></p>
           <p><b>The  basic premise in ancestor veneration was </b>that the soul of a departed family member  consisted of a <i>yin</i> component known as the <i>po </i>(associated with the  grave) and a <i>yang </i>component known as the <i>hun</i> (associated with the  ancestral tablet). According to one popular conception, these basic components  became three separate &ldquo;souls,&rdquo; each demanding ritual attention: one  soul went to the grave with the body; one  soul went to the Ten Courts of Judgment (also called the Ten Courts of Hell) and was eventually reborn; and one  soul remained in or near the ancestral tablet on the family altar. <i>Po </i>had the potential of becoming <i>gui </i>if unplacated  by sacrifices, but the spirits of one&rsquo;s own ancestors were not generally  considered to be <i>gui</i>. One&rsquo;s own naturally became <i>shen</i>, assuming  they received proper ritual attention.<a  class="caption" href="#fn">(2)</a> (For more on the terms <i>yin</i>, <i>yang</i>, <i>gui</i>,  and <i>shen</i>, see <a href="../bgov/cosmos.htm#yyfs">The Chinese Cosmos: Basic Concepts, especially the sections &ldquo;<i>Yinyang</i> and <i>Qi</i> in Human Beings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Understanding <i>Shen</i>.&rdquo;</a>)</p>
           <p><b>There  were two universal aspects of ancestor veneration in traditional China: mortuary rites (<i>sangli</i>) and sacrificial rites  (<i>jili</i>). Mortuary  rites involved elaborate mourning practices </b>that differed in particulars from  region to region but shared certain major features. These were, in the order they usually occurred: 1) public notification of the death through wailing and other expression  of grief; 2) the wearing of white mourning clothing by members of the bereaved family; 3) ritualized bathing  of the corpse; 4) the transfer of food, money, and other symbolic goods from the living to the dead; 5) the preparation and installation of a spirit tablet for the deceased; 6) the payment of ritual specialists, including Buddhist monks and Daoist priests; 7) the playing of music to accompany the corpse and settle the spirit; 8) the sealing of the corpse in an air-tight coffin; 9) the expulsion of the coffin from the community.<a  class="caption" href="#fn">(3)</a> In most regions of China a funeral procession for the body and spirit tablet, followed by a feast for family members, marked the formal conclusion of the mourning process. </p>
           <p><b>Sacrificial  rites consisted of daily or bimonthly devotions and anniversary services. </b>Families burned incense every day on the domestic ancestral altar, which houses  the family spirit tablets in hierarchical order. In front of the tablets often  glowed an eternal flame, symbol of the ancestor&rsquo;s abiding presence within the  household. Anniversary rites took place on the death date of each major  deceased member of the family. Sacrificial food was offered, and living members  of the family participated in the ceremony in ritual order based on age and  generation. Sacrifices were also made to the ancestors during major festival  periods and on important family occasions such as births and weddings. In  general, these domestic devotions reflected a ritual apparatus characteristic  of most other forms of Chinese religious practice.<a  class="caption" href="#fn">(4)</a></p>
           <p><b>In  the eyes of the orthodox Confucians, ancestor veneration was considered to be  essentially a secular rite without religious implications. </b>Deemed to be nothing  more than the &ldquo;expression of human feelings,&rdquo; mourning and other ritual  observances expressed love and respect for the dead and at the same time  cultivated the virtues of filial piety, loyalty, and faithfulness. Ancestor  veneration was a standard means of &ldquo;honoring virtue and repaying merit&rdquo; (<i>chongde  baogong</i>), in the stock Chinese phrase. The Confucian gentleman sacrificed  to his ancestors because it was the proper thing to do; lesser men did so to  &ldquo;serve the spirits.&rdquo;<a  class="caption" href="#fn">(5)</a></p>
           <p>This attitude was consistent with  the general neo-Confucian tendency to encourage rational and secular  interpretations of otherworldly phenomena. In neo-Confucian literature, for example, the popular religious terms <i>gui</i> and <i>shen</i> became expressly identified as the abstract forces of <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>. Official religion was justified at least in part as a means of motivating the masses to perform acts of Confucian piety. Sections on religion in local gazetteers often quoted the following commentary to the <i>Yijing</i>, attributed to Confucius himself: &ldquo;The sages  devised guidance in the name of the gods, and [the people of] the land became obedient.&rdquo; Even the employment of priests, geomancers, and other religious agents by elite households could be explained away as matters of habit, female indulgence, or a kind of filial insurance for ancestors in case the popular Buddhist version of the afterlife happened to be correct.<a  class="caption" href="#fn">(6)</a>(For more on the terms <i>yin</i>, <i>yang</i>, <i>gui</i>,  and <i>shen</i>, see <a href="../bgov/cosmos.htm#yyfs">The Chinese Cosmos: Basic Concepts, especially the sections &ldquo;<i>Yinyang</i> and <i>Qi</i> in Human Beings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Understanding <i>Shen</i>.&rdquo;</a>)</p>
          <p>But where did Confucian  &ldquo;rationalism&rdquo; end and popular  &ldquo;superstition&rdquo; begin? Although popular religion reflected the social landscape of its adherents, it was still in many ways  &ldquo;a variation of the same [elite] understanding of the world.&rdquo; The  &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; of the Chinese literati may have been remote and impersonal, but it could reward Confucian virtue and punish vice in the same spirit as the Jade Emperor and his agents; and the omens and avenging ghosts of popular vernacular literature had their supernatural counterparts in the official dynastic histories.<a  class="caption" href="#fn">(7)</a></p>
          <h2>THE SOUL&rsquo;S JOURNEY AFTER DEATH: INTO THE UNDERWORLD REALM </h2>
           <p>According to popular religious beliefs in traditional China, when a person died the local Earth God (or, as some accounts went, the god who had accompanied the person throughout his or her life and kept a record or his or her good and evil deeds) immediately took charge of the soul that was to undertake the journey <a href="underworld.htm">to the Underworld</a> and  brought this soul before the local City God, who looked over the record of deeds that accompanied the soul. The City God  then sent the soul down into the Underworld to go before the first of ten judges, also called the ten Magistrates of Hell. The Underworld domain of the Chinese cosmos was a transitory space and time for just one of the multiple souls of the dead and could not properly be called &ldquo;hell&rdquo; in the Christian sense of a place of perpetual punishment for a permanent, unchanging self. Still, the domain of the ten magistrates was a place where souls were held accountable for their actions in life and harsh punishments were meted out.<a name="salvation">&nbsp;</a></p>
           <h2>THE GOLDEN BRIDGE OR THE SILVER BRIDGE?: CHOOSING BETWEEN PARADISE AND HEAVEN</h2>
           <p>Not all souls had to face judgment before all ten Magistrates of Hell. The rare soul that had led an exemplary life could gain immediate release from the Underworld Realm and leave by way of two bridges, often called the &ldquo;Golden Bridge&rdquo;  and the &ldquo;Silver Bridge.&rdquo; Each bridge led to a very different destiny, and the soul had to choose between the two.</p>
           <p><b>The Golden Bridge  took the soul to the &ldquo;Pure Land of the West&rdquo;</b> <a href="#fn">(<i>Xifang jingtu</i>; also  see Note 8, below)</a>, which was <i>not</i> a part of the cosmos. This Pure Land was presided over by the <a href="../ort/buddhism.htm#buddha">Buddha Amit&#0257bha</a>, and after encountering Amit&#0257bha face-to-face, the soul could finally achieve what institutional Buddhism called <i>nirv&#0257&#7751;a</i> -- complete release from the cycle of birth and rebirth. Thus, a soul choosing the Western Pure Land attained salvation <i>from </i>the cosmos itself. <b>The Silver Bridge, on the other hand, led to Heaven, </b>which was an important domain of the cosmos. <a href="heavenly.htm">Heaven was ruled by the Jade Emperor</a> and populated by gods and heavenly officials. The soul entering into Heaven via the Silver Bridge would be reborn as a god and become an important figure in the cosmos.</p>
           <p>This choice between the Pure Land beyond the cosmos and the Heavenly domain within the cosmos represents a major tension in Chinese popular religion. Was it more desirable to escape the cosmos altogether and experience eternal bliss in the Pure Land, or to remain in the cosmos as a god in Heaven?<b> </b>Both options rely on ideas that originated with <a href="../ort/buddhism.htm">the arrival of Buddhism in China</a> and point to the important impact of Buddhism on the totality of Chinese religious thinking.<a name="quick">&nbsp;</a> </p>
           <h2>HELPING THE DEAD MOVE THROUGH HELL QUICKLY</h2>
           <p>Though all souls in the Underworld might hope for immediate release to the Pure Land or to Heaven, the majority must face judgment and some punishment before all ten Magistrates of Hell. The basic conduct of mourning and funerary rituals was carried on with this assumption: that very few people, if any, get to cross either the Golden Bridge or the Silver Bridge. Thus, the point of the rituals was to get the deceased through the ten Courts of Hell as quickly as possible.</p>

             <p>The image above is a detail from a &ldquo;Hell Scroll&rdquo; series depicting the Ten Courts of the Magistrates of the Underworld. Shown are the &ldquo;exemplary souls&rdquo; obtaining release from the Underworld realm because they have exhibited great virtue in life. This bridge is called the &ldquo;Bridge of the Seven Treasures&rdquo; (rather than the &ldquo;Golden Bridge&rdquo;) and an inscription above each soul explains the reason for his release (l-r): <i>Cultivating the Way while in Office</i>; <i>Enlightening the Mind and Understanding the Nature</i>; <i>Building Buddhist Monasteries and Daoist Temples</i>; <i>Finding Joy in Goodness and Delighting in Sharing</i>; <i>Understanding Parents&rsquo; Kindness and Repaying the Root Provided by the Ancestors</i>.

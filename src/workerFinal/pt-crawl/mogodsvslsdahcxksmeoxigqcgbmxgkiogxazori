/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        333]] </font>All my readers know the name of our great philosophic thinker 
        and writer, Herbert Spencer, but they are perhaps not aware that to him 
        is primarily due the formation of the Land Nationalization Society. In 
        1853, soon after I returned from my travels in the Amazon Valley, I read 
        his book on <em>Social Statics</em>, and from it first derived the conception 
        of the radical injustice of private property in land. His irresistible 
        logic convinced me once for all, and I have never since had the slightest 
        doubt upon the subject. He taught me, that &quot;to deprive others of their 
        rights to the use of the earth is to commit a crime inferior only in wickedness 
        to the crime of taking away their lives or their personal liberties;&quot; 
        and when he added, that however difficult it might be to find a practical 
        means of restoring the land to the people, yet &quot;justice sternly commands 
        it to be done,&quot; a seed was sown in my mind which long afterwards developed 
        into that principle of the separation of the inherent value of land from 
        the improvements effected in or upon it, which was the foundation of the 
        proposals in my article &quot;How to Nationalize the Land&quot; (see Chapter XVI.), 
        and this article led to my association with Mr. Swinton, Dr. Clark, M.P., 
        and other friends in the formation of the Land Nationalization Society. 
        In one of his latest works, however, entitled <em>Justice</em>, and forming 
        part of his <em>Principles of Ethics</em>, Mr. Spencer repudiates his 
        legitimate offspring--Land Nationalization-- <font color="990000">[[p. 
        334]]</font> and for various stated reasons arrives at the conclusion 
        that, though it may be, and is, right in principle, there are insuperable 
        difficulties in putting it into practice, and that therefore &quot;individual 
        ownership subject to State-suzerainty should be maintained.&quot; This, of 
        course, will be seized upon by our opponents as a great triumph for the 
        cause of landlordism, though as yet they seem hardly to have realized 
        that a Daniel has come to judgment in their behalf. But we must always 
        remember that they mostly belong to what has been termed &quot;the silly party,&quot; 
        and that they cannot therefore be expected to read works on high philosophy. 
        Land Nationalizers, however, who have long quoted, and will continue to 
        quote, from <em>Social Statics--</em>not because the book was written 
        by Herbert Spencer, but because it was among the earliest and the most 
        forcible of the arguments against private property in land--are bound 
        to show that the philosopher has not refuted his own work, and that it 
        is his later and not his earlier writings that are illogical, and are 
        even inconsistent with the main principles of his own philosophy.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first let us 
        see what he still admits. After showing how land-ownership has been derived 
        from conquest or usurpation, and that all the land originally belonged 
        to the Crown as representing the whole nation, he says:--</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;If 
          the representative body has practically inherited the governmental powers 
          which in past times vested in the king, it has at the same time inherited 
          that ultimate proprietorship of the soil which in past times vested 
          in him. And since the representative body is but the agent of the community, 
          this ultimate proprietorship now vests in the community.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></font>
      </p></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he then remarks 
        that even the Liberty and Property Defence League admit this, saying in 
        their Report of 1889 that:</p>
      <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;The land 
        can of course be resumed on payment of full compensation, and managed 
        by the people if they so will it.&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another place 
        Mr. Spencer states, as proving the <font color="990000">[[p. 335]] </font>spread 
        of more correct ideas of justice, that the truth has now come to be recognized, 
        that--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p><font size="-1"><blockquote>&quot;private ownership of land is 
        subject to the supreme ownership of the community, and that therefore 
        each citizen has a latent claim to participate in the use of the earth.&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></blockquote>
      </font> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, then, Mr. 
        Spencer and the Liberty and Property Defence League are perfectly in accord 
        with us; but thenceforth we diverge. They believe and maintain that this 
        latent claim of the people to the full and equal use of their native soil 
        shall and will remain latent. We, on the other hand, believe and are determined 
        that it shall now become an active claim, and very soon a realized possession.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us see what 
        are Mr. Spencer's grounds for believing that land must, at all events 
        in the immediate future, remain private property. It is as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">&quot;All which 
        can be claimed for the community is the surface of the country in its 
        original unsubdued state. To add that value given to it by clearing, fencing, 
        draining, making roads, farm-buildings, &amp;c., constituting nearly all 
        its value the community has no claim. . . . All this value, artificially 
        given, vests in existing owners and cannot without a gigantic robbery 
        be taken from them. If, during the many transactions which have brought 
        about existing landownership, there have been much violence and much fraud, 
        these have been small compared with the violence and frauds which the 
        community would be guilty of did it take possession without paying for 
        it, of that artificial value which the labour of nearly two thousand years 
        has given to the land.&quot;<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></font></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all that 
        Mr. Spencer has to say on the question in the body of the work, and before 
        going on to consider his further discussion of it in an appendix, we must 
        just notice the gigantic and almost incredible misstatement, that the 
        improvements such as he specifies, made upon the land by human labour, 
        constitute &quot;nearly all its value!&quot; Setting aside houses, fences and things 
        of like character, which we have always recognized as being personal property 
        to be purchased at fair value by the new occupiers, how much is the soil 
        of England on the whole better for agricultural purposes than it was one 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 336]] </font>hundred, or five hundred, or a 
        thousand years ago? In all probability it is not ten per cent. better, 
        because, though limited areas have been greatly improved, very large areas 
        remain quite unimproved, and other large areas have been decidedly made 
        worse. More than half the whole area of the country is permanent pasture 
        which has been mown or grazed from time immemorial, and is probably no 
        better and no worse than it was a hundred or five hundred years ago. But 
        every one with an observant eye may notice all over the country poor weedy 
        pastures bearing the ridge marks of former cultivation. These were once 
        old pastures, broken up when wheat and rents were high, and afterwards 
        left to return as they could to the poor weedy land we now see. This land 
        has been positively deteriorated; and besides this, much of our farming 
        is still so bad under yearly tenancies that a large part of the arable 
        land is partially worn out, and is probably no better if it is not worse 
        than five hundred years ago when we not only grew all the wheat we required 
        but exported to the Continent.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr. Spencer's 
        chief error consists in the latent assumption that increased <em>value</em> 
        of land implies <em>improvement</em> in the soil, ignoring altogether 
        that this increase is almost wholly due to the growth of population and 
        improved means of communication. Let us take as an illustration the land 
        around London. The late J. C. Loudon, the celebrated gardener and agriculturist, 
        came to London from Scotland about the year 1804, and found the land to 
        the west of the city--now occupied by the suburbs or by market gardens--let 
        in small farms at 10<em>s.</em> or 12<em>s.</em> an acre. Now, probably, 
        the lowest rent is as many pounds as it was then shillings, while much 
        that is built over brings a hundred times the rent it did then; but that 
        is not owing to any improvement of the soil itself, but wholly, or almost 
        wholly, to railroads and to the consequent growth of London. Again, portions 
        of the New Forest have remained wholly unimproved since the time of the 
        Norman kings, yet if any of this unimproved land were for sale it would 
        probably fetch a higher price than the best agricultural land in the kingdom 
        if situated in a <font color="990000">[[p. 337]]</font> worse or less 
        attractive locality. But neither these well-known facts, nor the other 
        fact that, whatever improvement there is in the land itself has mostly 
        been effected, not by the landlords but by successive generations of tenants, 
        are much to the purpose; because, as Mr. Spencer truly states, all the 
        value, by whomsoever created, now vests in the landlords. This has been 
        recognized, and is still recognized, by the law, and by a large preponderance 
        of public opinion, and therefore, I admit, as I think do most land-nationalizers, 
        that it must not be taken from existing owners without reasonable and 
        equitable compensation; and as Mr. Spencer thinks such a vast transaction 
        to be financially impossible, he concludes that &quot;individual ownership 
        must be maintained.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before showing how 
        superficial, illogical, and unjust is such a conclusion, we have to note 
        the extraordinary argument set forth in his Appendix B. He there says:--</p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Even 
        supposing that the English as a race gained possession of the land equitably, 
        which they did not; and even supposing that existing landowners are the 
        posterity of those who spoiled their fellows, which in large part they 
        are not; and even supposing that the existing landless are the posterity 
        of the despoiled, which in large part they are not; there would still 
        have to be recognized a transaction that goes far to prevent rectification 
        of injustices.&quot;<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></font></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what do you 
        think this &quot;transaction&quot; is? I would give every one of my readers who 
        is not familiar with the work we are discussing half-a-dozen guesses each, 
        and probably not one person would hit upon this stupendous &quot;transaction&quot; 
        which, apparently, in Mr. Spencer's opinion, settles the land question, 
        and forbids all future generations of Englishmen from possessing their 
        native land, the soil of which is to remain the absolute property of existing 
        landlords--their heirs, administrators, or assigns, as the lawyers say--for 
        ever. In no other way can I interpret the terrible dictum that it &quot;goes 
        far to prevent the rectification of injustices.&quot; This momentous transaction 
        is nothing but our old and too familiar friend, the Poor-rate!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the solution 
        of the problem. Mr. Spencer <font color="990000">[[p. 338]]</font> gives 
        elaborate figures to show that the amount of that portion of the poor-rate 
        contributed by the land during the last two-and-a-half centuries amounts 
        to about 500 millions, and this he thinks is more than the &quot;prairie-value&quot; 
        of the whole of the land! He says:</p>
      <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"> &quot;Thus, even if we ignore the fact that this amount, gradually contributed, would, 
        if otherwise gradually invested, have yielded in returns of one kind or 
        another a far larger sum, it is manifest that against the claim of the 
        landless may be set off a large claim of the landed--perhaps a larger 
        claim.&quot;
      </font></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a turning 
        of the tables with a vengeance! If this is the true state of the case 
        we had better at once present a humble petition to the landlords, praying 
        that they will let us off whatever balance may be due to them, on our 
        undertaking to pay all the poor-rates for the future. For, if Mr. Spencer's 
        reasoning is sound, this is what, in his own words, &quot;Equity sternly commands 
        should be done.&quot; But, first, let us look a little closer at this &quot;new 
        way to pay old debts.&quot; Mr. Spencer says, that &quot;if we are to go back upon 
        the past at all, we must go back upon the past wholly.&quot; These are his 
        own words. Let us then do so, and what shall we find? We find that the 
        landlords have, century by century, continuously evaded or thrown off 
        the burdens and duties which appertained to their original tenure of the 
        land. The whole costs of the maintenance of the crown, of the army and 
        navy, of the church, and of the poor, were payable by the landlords or 
        by the proceeds of land which they have stolen from the church and from 
        the people. We find also that the tenants on their estates had originally<sup> 
        </sup>rights of possession similar to their own, on performance of specified 
        duties. We find that in the time of the Tudors, they themselves created 
        the very pauperism that has been handed down to us, by over-riding those 
        rights. They carried out wholesale evictions of the cultivators of the 
        soil, because the high price of wool rendered the turning of arable land 
        into pasture profitable to them.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> Again we find <font color="990000">[[p. 
        339]]</font> that the vast estates of the abbeys and monasteries whose 
        inmates had educated the people and relieved the poor, were absorbed by 
        them, often for no services at all, often for disgraceful services. We 
        find a little later, in 1692, that the remnant of their feudal duties 
        was, with their own consent, commuted into &quot;a tax of 4<em>s.</em> in the 
        pound on a rack-rent without abatement for any charges whatever;&quot; and 
        we find that the valuation made at that date, which we may be sure was 
        a low one even then, has been fraudulently maintained by a landlord parliament 
        to this day, notwithstanding the increase of land-values to many-fold 
        its amount at that date. Yet again we find that even during the past century 
        about three millions of acres of common lands have been most inequitably 
        enclosed and divided among the landlords, thus robbing the people of the 
        last remnant of their rights to their native soil, and creating more pauperism. 
        And lastly, it must be remembered that pauperism itself has been a direct 
        benefit to the landlords, inasmuch as the poor-rates were once openly, 
        and are still actually, &quot;relief in aid of low wages&quot; paid by all classes 
        of the community, and which enabled, and still enable, farmers to get 
        cheap labour and landlords higher rents. Under these circumstances, and 
        remembering all these iniquities of the past, even landlord assurance 
        will probably recoil before making the claim Mr. Spencer suggests, that 
        payment of poor-rates since 1630 is really a re-purchase of the land 
        from the people!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in all this 
        discussion and in much more of a like kind that I have neither time nor 
        inclination to notice, Mr. Spencer misses the real point at issue. It 
        matters not to us, now, whether existing landlords or their ancestors 
        got possession of the land equitably or fraudulently, or whether all landlords 
        (as some have done) bought the land at full value with hard-earned money. 
        It matters not whether the ancestors of the present landless class were 
        serfs or nobles, whether they never had land, or whether they sold or 
        gambled away their inheritance. All this has nothing whatever to do with 
        the main question, which is, the essential wrong to the community of private 
        property in land; whether to deprive others of the use of <font color="990000">[[p. 
        340]]</font> the earth, now and for future generations, is or is not, 
        in Herbert Spencer's own words, &quot;a crime inferior only in wickedness to 
        the crime of taking away their lives or personal liberties.&quot; If Mr. Spencer 
        had taken the trouble to study the Programme of the Land Nationalization 
        Society, which it would have been a natural and proper thing for him to 
        have done before arguing against the possibility of such nationalization--he 
        would have found that, among the eight reasons we give for holding private 
        ownership of land to be wrong, the mode in which it has been acquired 
        either by past or present generations of landlords finds no place. We 
        ground our claim on considerations of absolute justice as well as of practical 
        expediency, and as against us, all the good or evil deeds of landlords 
        or their ancestors are wholly beside the question. We maintain, that, 
        when a great wrong has been done in the past, a wrong which still produces 
        and must ever produce evil results, a wrong which is the fundamental cause 
        of the wide-spread pauperism and misery that pervades our land--it is 
        our primary duty to find a means of abolishing that wrong. And when the 
        great philosopher who first taught us how enormous was this wrong, goes 
        back on his own words, declares that he sees no way out of the difficulty, 
        and that the huge injustice to the living and to the unborn must go on 
        indefinitely--then we refuse to accept the teachings of such a helpless 
        guide, who sets before us this most impotent conclusion under the holy 
        name of JUSTICE.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now turn 
        for a while to consider the fundamental principles of Mr. Spencer's Social-philosophy--principles 
        which are altogether excellent, and which, if he had boldly and logically 
        followed them out, would have shown him how this great wrong--this wicked 
        crime of land-monopoly may be easily and equitably abolished.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second paragraph 
        of his Chapter entitled <em>Human Justice</em> (as distinguished from 
        animal and sub-human justice previously discussed), Mr. Spencer thus lays 
        down the ethical correlative of the law of survival of the fittest in 
        the animal world:--&quot;Each individual ought to receive <font color="990000">[[p. 
        341]]</font> the benefits and the evils of his own nature and consequent 
        conduct: neither being prevented from having whatever good his actions 
        normally bring to him, nor allowed to shoulder off on to other persons 
        whatever ill is brought to him by his actions.&quot; This law is appealed to 
        again and again throughout the book, as being a decisive test of the right 
        or wrong, the usefulness or the hurtfulness of certain social or governmental 
        agencies. It is generally given under a shorter form of words, such as--&quot;Each 
        adult shall receive the results of his own nature and consequent actions&quot;--or 
        still more briefly--&quot;Each shall receive the benefits and evils due to 
        his own nature and conduct.&quot; This is the fundamental principle of social 
        development according to the Spencerian philosophy; and from it is derived 
        the formula of JUSTICE--&quot;Every man is free to do that which he wills, 
        provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man,&quot; or briefly 
        &quot;The liberty of each limited only by the like liberty of all.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these principles 
        Mr. Spencer deduces many important results as to personal and social rights--among 
        others the right of property, the right of free industry, and the right 
        of gift and bequest. Under this latter heading he makes an important qualification, 
        as follows:--&quot;One who holds land subject to that supreme ownership of 
        the Community which both ethics and law assert, cannot rightly have such 
        power of willing the application of it as involves permanent alienation 
        from the community.&quot;<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> With this rather vague statement he leaves 
        the subject, and afterwards affirms those extraordinary propositions I 
        have already quoted as to the permanence of private property in land, 
        and the extinguishment of the people's right through payment of two centuries 
        of poor-rates!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we logically 
        follow out the Spencerian principles we shall find that the right of bequest 
        has far more extensive limitations than the author gives it, limitations 
        which render it easy for the State, that is the people, equitably to regain 
        possession of their own land. For, if the law that--&quot;each shall receive 
        the good or evil results of his own nature and actions&quot; be a true guide 
        to social <font color="990000">[[p. 342]]</font> development, then the 
        correlative of it must also be true, that no one shall receive throughout 
        life, that which is <em>not</em> the result of his own nature and actions; 
        and this will absolutely forbid such bequests to children or others as 
        will render them independent of all personal exertion, enabling them to 
        live idle lives on the labour of others, and thus neutralize the operation 
        of that beneficent law which gives to each the results of &quot;his own nature 
        and acts.&quot; To permit unlimited bequest is, in fact, doubly injurious. 
        It is a positive injury to the recipient whenever it enables him to live 
        a life of idleness and pleasure--to be a mere drone in the human hive. 
        And it is also a gross injustice to the rest of the community, for when 
        such parasites abound they become a burden on the industrious who necessarily 
        support these idlers by their labour. We must further consider, that, 
        so long as landlordism continues, this idle and generally useless portion 
        of the community may increase almost indefinitely, because savings can 
        be made by all large landlords, on which savings a larger and ever larger 
        number of succeeding generations may live without exertion, and thus render 
        the lot of the workers harder in proportion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange that 
        Mr. Spencer did not perceive that if this law of the connection between 
        individual actions and their results is to be allowed free play, some 
        social arrangement must be made by which all may start in life with an 
        approach to equality of opportunities. While, as now, some are brought 
        up from childhood among low and degrading surroundings--material, intellectual, 
        and moral--and have to struggle amid fierce competition for the bare necessaries 
        of life, it is absurd to maintain that they receive the legitimate results 
        of their own nature and actions only; both of which may be and often are 
        far superior to those of thousands whose early years are surrounded by 
        all the refinements of a higher social life, and who find a place provided 
        for them in which with little effort on their part they can provide for 
        all their wants, their comforts, and their pleasures. Such a law as Mr. 
        Spencer has formulated becomes a mockery and a delusion, unless each individual 
        is given a fair start in life, <font color="990000">[[p. 343]] </font>and 
        this can never be the case under a system of landlordism and unlimited 
        bequest.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Spencer's fundamental 
        principle of social justice, therefore, logically implies that the power 
        of free gift and bequest should be placed under strict limitations, the 
        State taking to itself all above the amount which may be judged necessary 
        for providing each heir with such ample education and endowment as may 
        give him or her a favourable start in life--after which they must be left 
        to receive the results of their own nature and actions; while the surplus 
        property thus accumulated will form a fund out of which to endow in like 
        manner all those whose parents are not able to provide for them. This 
        branch of the subject however does not directly concern us here except 
        in so far as it leads us to consider the application of the Spencerian 
        principles of JUSTICE to the land question.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told distinctly 
        that no landowner should be allowed to leave his land in such a way as 
        to permanently alienate it from the community to which it rightly belongs. 
        But to concede the right of unlimited gift or bequest <em>does</em> so 
        alienate it; therefore no such right should exist. There is another principle, 
        which was asserted by the great jurist Jeremy Bentham, and which is of 
        some importance as a guide:--That laws should never be such as to disappoint 
        &quot;just expectations&quot;--expectations which people had been brought up to 
        consider both legal and equitable. Such an expectation, in our country, 
        is that of succeeding to one's father's property. But no one can have 
        such an expectation till he is born, nor even for some few years afterwards. 
        We may therefore, from every point of view, equitably enact that, from 
        the date of the law, no land shall descend to any person then unborn. 
        We may also rightly add that it shall descend only in the direct line--that 
        is to children and children's children living at the time of passing the 
        Act, because no collateral relatives have any just or reasonable claim 
        or expectation of succeeding to the land.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        344]]</font> Here then, by this simple and 
        perfectly equitable principle, we have found a means of transferring the 
        people's land back to the people, by a gradual process which would rob 
        nobody and cost nothing; and thus the whole huge mountain of difficulty 
        which has induced Mr. Spencer to look upon the restoration of the land 
        as a moral and financial impossibility crumbles into dust. The mode of 
        acquiring the land now suggested was advocated in my first article on 
        land Nationalization (see Chap. XVI.), and I myself, and many of my friends, 
        still think it to be the best. Of course we may and do also advocate the 
        power of compulsory purchase by local authorities to supply the immediate 
        wants of the people. But while this was being done, wherever needed, land 
        would be continually accruing to the State by the dying out of the direct 
        heirs of landlords; and land thus acquired, always administered by the 
        local authority and the proceeds of the rents equitably divided between 
        the State and the locality, would continually reduce the weight of both 
        imperial and local taxation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concludes all 
        that needs now be said of Mr. Spencer's new work. There are some other 
        points I should have liked to touch upon, but they are of less importance 
        from our present point of view. I hope that I have shown with sufficient 
        clearness the fallacies that underlie his recent utterances, and have 
        thereby enabled all land reformers to continue with a good conscience 
        to quote the burning and logical denunciation of landlordism to be found 
        in <em>Social Statics</em>, notwithstanding the author's recent attempt 
        to minimize the effect of them.</p>

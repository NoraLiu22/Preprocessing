<div id="ctl00_cphBody_divText" class="entry-content clearfix">
                <p>
                  Though comparable patterns and designs were once 
                  created elsewhere in Australia, the surviving style of ground mosaics 
                  appears to have been restricted to the people of the Centre - to 
                  the majority (but not all) of those living in the major range country, 
                  north from Alice Springs for about eight hundred kilometres and 
                  west to south-west to the Western Desert country. </p>
                  <p>European settlement and the spread of Christianity very largely 
                  destroyed the ceremonial life of our Arrernte group plus Pitjantjatjara, 
                  Pitubi, Walpiri, Amnatjira and Warramunga tribes. </p>
                  <p>Ground mosaics are the most elaborate of our art works, but complementary 
                  designs and decorations are applied to the bodies and specially 
                  constructed head dresses of actors: to secret-sacred ritual objects 
                  that are stored near the ceremonial grounds; and often to shields, 
                  boomerangs and other weapons. </p>
                  <h2>Mythololgical Forces</h2>
                  <p>The design elements are not, in themselves, considered dangerous. 
                    But in a ceremonial situation, when the correct secret-sacred chants 
                    are sung, they are believed to partake of mythological forces, whose 
                    essence they pass on to otherwise profane objects. Thus, the dancers 
                    and the objects they use are thought to become imbued with supernatural 
                    power. If not made unrecognisable in rituals, the decorations are 
                    usually destroyed immediately afterwards, for most are not to be 
                    displayed in secular situations. </p>
                    <p>The mythological beings, to which all Aboriginal people are totemically 
                    and ancestrally related in one way of another, are regarded not 
                    as really dead so much as at watchful rest. They still live in rock-holes, 
                    caves, clay-pans and other natural features. Sacrilegious behaviour, 
                    or casual regard for ancient custom and law, may so anger the supernatural 
                    beings that death and destruction follow. Sacrilege tat is recognised 
                    on the instant must be punished on the instant, so as to placate 
                    the creative ancestors. </p>
                    <h2>Ground Paintings</h2>
                    <p>The artists creating the ground paintings are all men; inevitably, 
                    they are well into middle age, for only after extensive and often 
                    very painful ritual is one knowledge and competent enough to depict 
                    the designs correctly. Younger but still ritually correct men are 
                    sometimes employed as assistants (obviously, a period of introductory 
                    instruction is required), but few men involved in making ground 
                    mosaics are under forty. Women have similar styles of body markings, 
                    have limited numbers of sacred objects and dances, and may mark 
                    the sand with leaves, sticks or their hands in the telling of stories; 
                    but they are not involved in making the decorated ground paintings. </p>
                  <p>No one man can create a ground design. In the complexity of Aboriginal 
                    social situation, each site that is still 'living' has at least 
                    two men who stand in a 'keeper-owner' relationship to it and two 
                    men called Kutungulu ('inspectors' or 'policemen') who ensure that 
                    their keeper-owners maintain correct protocol. Similarly, unless 
                    given formal dispensation, men can create only those paintings over 
                    which they are recognised as having authority: there is no concept 
                    of total artistic freedom in the Western sense. </p>
                    <h2>40,000 Years to Design</h2>
                    <p>Each major secret-sacred ground painting represents both an individual 
                    identifiable geographical locality and a mythological incident that 
                    occured there, although is inevitable that related sites and incidents 
                    will also be recalled. As there are hundreds upon hundreds of differents 
                    sites in a tribal territory, ranging from individual tress or rocks 
                    to mountains, the most learned old men may well know the details 
                    of hundreds of paintings - even possibly, of more than a thousand. 
                    The designs must be relatively static in composition and have persisted 
                    over a great meny generations to allow for such feats of memory. </p>
                    <h2>Rock Engraving</h2>
                    <p>An indication of the ancient derivations of the ground art is that 
                    identical designs elements occur in the rock engravings, some of 
                    which are now known to be about twenty thousand years old. Plain 
                    and concentric cirlces, straight bar-lines and sinuous lines and 
                    animal tracks prevail in each art form. The major difference is 
                    probably, the regular inclusion of arcs (representing seated figures) 
                    in ground painting. There a similarity is the absence of the square 
                    or rectangle, a design element that frequently occurs on woomeras 
                    (spear throwers), hard-wood shields and other wooden objects. Despite 
                    the similarities, however, the fragile nature and purposeful destruction 
                    of ground paintings - presumably in ancient times as in modern - 
                    makes it unlikely that we will ever know when this form of art became 
                    prevalent.</p>
                <h2>Ewaninga</h2>
                <p>All ground paintings, and the modern paintings on canvas or art-board 
                  which are derived from them, are meant to be seen as plan views. 
                  This is almost certainly influenced by the hunting and foraging 
                  life-styles that the Aborigines once followed and, to varying degrees, 
                  still do. It is a great asset, when travelling the bush, if the 
                  slightest sign of a track - a scratch on clay or recognised as indicating 
                  the time and direction of travel, and the type of animal that caused 
                  it. Conservation of energy in the hunt is almost as essential as 
                  the discovery of game. (The exceptional tracking skills of the Aborigines 
                  have been successfully used for finding lost people or seeking out 
                  criminals; Aboriginal trackers are employed by the police in all 
                  remote areas.) </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; Humankind has an urge to garden. While
many people manage to suppress this instinct, or are in situations where they are unable
to fulfil it, others indulge it joyfully. Humankind started in a garden, created in the
image of the <a href="#Creator">Creator</a>, therefore we are creative. But we are also
destructive. "To harm the earth is to heap contempt on its Creator." -Chief
Seattle</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp; The earth itself is a garden of incredible
beauty and diversity. It is also complex beyond comprehension. It could not have been an
accident. A friend of mine who is good at such things calculated the odds of the simplest
of all life forms - a virus - to auto-assemble given a full pool of amino acids (which has
itself never been witnessed). The virus in question has 50,000 DNA base pairs, which
yields an astronomical 1 in 4 to the 50,000 power. That's 1:999,000 followed by over 6
typed pages of zeros. <font size="3">T</font></font><font face="Arial" size="3">his
doesn't even take into account that viruses need hosts - bacteria, which are far more
complex.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not the owners of the
earth. We are but stewards, and we are accountable for what we do. Will we smother our
vegetables with insecticide dust? Or will we learn how the pest in controlled in Nature,
and find out why we are having a problem with it, and how to fine tune our gardening so
the problem is fixed without poisons?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Many years ago I was shown (by a
"native" American friend), a stinking sewer pipe dumping raw sewage into the
creek. The pipe came from the village where I lived. They did not have, nor had ever had
any kind of sewage treatment for the village. I was able to publish an article on the
pollution, with photos, in the local newspaper. This made some folks mad at me, but
embarrassed some public officials enough to spur them toward the establishment of a modern
sewage treatment system. Within three years, the creek was cleaned up. Fish and wildlife
habitat was restored.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing more powerful
than knowledge. Neither I, nor most of my village, knew the results of the lack of sewage
treatment, until it was plainly shown to us. Once the problem was generally known, it was
solved.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the chief environmental
problems today is indiscriminate pesticide use. Pesticides should be the last resort, but
are usually the first. A little more thinking, some careful planning, and pesticide usage
could be reduced many times over.&nbsp; And it should be because many unnoticed creatures
that make our survival on this planet possible, are threatened by overuse and misuse of
pesticides. I refer to the wonderful "bugs" that pollinate our plants, break
down our wastes, and control our pests. A lot of folks think all insects are pests. But
without the beneficial insects, life on earth would be impossible for us.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let me go back to stalking
these critters for awhile with my camera. When I get a good set of pictures, I'll be back
here to post them....</font></p>

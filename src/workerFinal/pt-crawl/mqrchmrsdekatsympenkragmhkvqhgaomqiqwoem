  <button class="accordion-item__title" aria-controls="panel-content" aria-expanded="false">Terms and Conditions for Use of Online Collections Databases</button>
  <div class="accordion-item__teaser"><p>This document has two parts, the first a general description of  some key issues in the development and use of the data here. The second section  is the fine print: the formal do’s and don’ts for appropriate use,  attribution, and understanding of the data.</p>
<p>Key Issues:</p>
<p>The online databases on this Web site (the Natural History Web)  constitute a compilation of data (See Smithsonian Institution Terms of Use at <a href="https://www.si.edu/termsofuse">https://www.si.edu/termsofuse</a>). The  data represent a work in progress. An appropriate understanding of what the  data are, their strengths and weaknesses, will ensure that your use of these  data is appropriate and correct.</p>
<p>1. What is here</p>
<p>The physical collections of the National Museum of Natural History  (NMNH) have been assembled for over 150 years by many dedicated and hardworking  people in many parts of the world. The data associated with the NMNH  collections are in many forms: they are hand-written in ledgers, typed on file  cards, on labels stored with the collections, and, for the last 50 years,  captured in a series of computer-stored databases. Due to the size of its  collections and financial constraints, the NMNH has not yet been able to  computerize all of the basic data about its collections. NMNH constantly adds  records to our collections databases, increasing the percentage of specimens  for which we have computer-retrievable information. To date, electronic data  capture has been completed for only about 21% of the collections. The most  complete parts of our databases include type specimens in our biological  collections, meteorites, gems and minerals, and certain other collections.</p>
<p>2. Issues of accuracy and completeness</p>
<p>The information on the Natural History Web is as accurate as our  staff can reasonably make it. However, the nature of much of the research of  the museum is to examine and understand the specimens and their relationships  to one another and their natural environment. Fundamental to this in the  biological sciences is the process of re-identifying and re-classifying the  specimens. Many of the specimens that are listed in the databases have not been  examined for many years and the data about them may be inaccurate because the  specimens were originally misidentified; the specimens were correctly  identified at that time, but a scientist here or elsewhere has re-classified  the group and the “new” name is not reflected here; or the data were  mistyped/transcribed from the ledgers or file cards. As specimens and data are  reexamined, the data are corrected to be as accurate as possible. <strong>Please, if  you believe that data you are examining are not correct, let us know what and  why. We will work to make any necessary corrections. </strong>Please contact <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research">NMNH data managers</a> for the  discipline you are interested in. For more information about how to contact the  appropriate data manager, please see: <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/contact-us">Contact Us</a> <br><br>
  Because the process of adding, improving, editing, and fixing NMNH  data is an ongoing task, the data are never “definitive”. Ideally NMNH should  get to the point of having all of its collections in electronic form, but even  then, as researchers and collections staff work on specimens,  scientifically-based and editorial changes will occur and modifications to the  databases will be made.<br><br>
  For many questions that you may want answered, data will be needed  from many sources, including NMNH and other museums or universities. We are  working with national and international initiatives to make certain that our  data will be in a compatible format and/or available from a single site (single  query).</p>
<p>3. The importance of non-occurrence</p>
<p>Key to correct use of the data here is an understanding of the <em>difficulties  in using negative information.</em> Our data constitute positive information  only; that is, it is a record of something found in a particular place at a  particular time. The absence of a record of a particular species or object does  not necessarily mean that it was not present at that particular place and  time—it means that it was not collected, that it is not in NMNH collections, or  that the data have not been captured electronically. Scientific collections are  usually strong in particular geographic areas, groups, or kinds of objects that  have been of interest to the staff who use them. For that reason, and others,  they are incomplete. There are many places where collecting has been done  repeatedly, many areas where no collecting has ever been done for a particular  group, and some areas where no collecting has ever been done. It is a common,  but frequently incorrect, interpretation of collections data that gaps in  distribution means absence of the organism or object of interest. That  interpretation is often incorrect even if you know that the organism has been  looked for there because many animals are seasonal in their distribution and  others may show up in a place one year and not again for many years.  Understanding the positive-only nature of the data, and how they are pieces of  a larger puzzle of environmental and historical understanding, is critical to  their proper interpretation and appropriate use.</p>
<p>Terms and Conditions of Use</p>
<p>By accessing or using these data, you agree to the following  conditions:</p>
<ol>

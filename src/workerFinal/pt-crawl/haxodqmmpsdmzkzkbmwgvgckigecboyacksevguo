<p>
Part 1 
</p>
</font></u></b> 
<p>
Following is the official statement by the University of Michigan on the book, 
<b><u>Darkness in El Dorado,</u></b> by Patrick Tierney, forthcoming from W.W. 
Norton &amp; Co. on November 16, 2000. 
</p>
<p>
We now have galley proofs of the book, and are examining them in detail. In the 
meantime, however, we will respond to the allegations outlined in an e-mail message 
from two reviewers, Terence Turner of Cornell University and Leslie Sponsel of 
the University of Hawaii-Manoa. Their e-mail makes reference to the work of James 
V. Neel, M.D., and Napoleon Chagnon, Ph.D., with the Yanomami of Venezuela. Dr. 
Neel died last February. 
</p>
<p>
The University takes allegations of impropriety seriously and we have begun an 
internal inquiry. In the short time we have been engaged in this review, we have 
already found materials directly contradicting a number of the claims cited in 
the e-mail message regarding Dr. Neel and Dr. Chagnon. These errors are repeated 
in the galley proofs. 
</p>
<b> 
<p>
We believe that Mr. Tierney has not consulted important original source material 
that was readily available for review. Analysis of that material and other material 
from persons familiar with the expeditions, the measles outbreak, and the measles 
vaccine refutes the allegations. 
</p>
</b> 
<p>
Below are listed some of the allegations and a description of our initial findings. 
</p>
<b> 
<p>
Claim: Improper use of a vaccine initiated and exacerbated a measles epidemic 
that killed "hundreds, perhaps thousands." 
</p>
</b> 
<p>
Our findings: The measles outbreak occurred in November 1967. Measles was introduced 
into the region by a party of Brazilian missionaries before the January 1968 arrival 
of the Neel expedition. There is substantial evidence of the outbreak existing 
long before Dr. Neel left for Venezuela, so Dr. Neel could not have been the cause. 
</p>
<p>
Previous studies in 1966 had indicated a substantial absence of measles antibody 
in the Yanomami. There were some individuals in Villages J and W with antibodies 
to measles, indicating there had been sporadic prior exposure but many individuals 
were not protected. Accordingly, in the fall of 1967, in anticipation of the January 
1968 expedition, Dr. Neel initiated requests to pharmaceutical companies and obtained 
2,000 doses of Edmonston B vaccine plus gamma globulin. He also consulted with 
a Center for Disease Control expert on measles on the best way to administer the 
vaccine. 
</p>
<p>
Upon hearing of the outbreak, Dr. Neel acted quickly and responsibly to stop the 
spread of the disease. The records show Dr. Neel spent at least two full weeks 
providing vaccine, antibiotics and medical care as needed. Forty Indians and Brazilians 
in the immediate area of the noted cases received vaccine and then Dr. Neel initiated 
an extensive program of immunization throughout the region. One thousand doses 
were administered by Dr. Neel; the rest were provided to and given by missionaries 
and medical auxiliaries of the Venezuelan government to "get ahead" of the disease. 
All doses, except for the original 40, were given with gamma globulin. At that 
time, administration of vaccine, with or without concomitant gamma globulin, was 
the accepted and recommended procedure. No death or serious untoward events resulted 
from use of the vaccine with or without gamma globulin. 
</p>
<p>
Edmonston B vaccine, developed in 1958, was an internationally tested and safe 
vaccine. Dr. Samuel L. Katz, professor emeritus and chairman of Pediatrics at 
Duke University Medical School, was the co-developer of the vaccine (with John 
F. Enders) and he reports that its use was safe and appropriate in this population. 
</p>
<p>
It is claimed that a "fatal" epidemic was "caused" or "greatly exacerbated" by 
the vaccine. Live attenuated vaccine has never been shown to be transmissible 
from a recipient to a subsequent contact. Dr. Katz has studied the vaccine in 
developed and developing nations and never saw any transmission of vaccine to 
susceptible contacts. Moreover, death as a result of the vaccine is an exceedingly 
rare event in any population. In fact, Dr. Katz reports that "despite the administration 
of millions of doses of vaccines to children throughout the world, the only deaths 
known to have occurred were in several youngsters who were under intense therapy 
for their leukemia and more recently a young adult with AIDS." 
</p>
<b> 
<p>
Claim: Refusal of medical care so that Dr. Neel could observe an epidemic. 
</p>
</b> 
<p>
Our findings: Dr. William Oliver, professor emeritus and chairman of Pediatrics 
at the University of Michigan Health System, was on several of the expeditions 
and reports that on every expedition a large quantity of medical supplies was 
brought in and used to treat the Yanomami. Dr. Neel's basic philosophy was to 
treat all illnesses before any scientific observations. Each day he would treat 
any new illnesses before starting the day's planned studies. Any medicines not 
used would be left with resident missionaries with detailed instructions for use. 
</p>
<p>
In the case of the measles outbreak, the facts are clear. The predicted death 
rate from untreated measles is 30 percent to 36 percent; the most common complication 
is bacterial pneumonia. In this outbreak, the death rate was a very low 8.8 percent, 
showing clearly that proper medical care was provided. The records show that the 
research team systematically and aggressively treated every patient with all available 
medications. As indicated above, Dr. Neel stopped his research work so that he 
could provide medical care to the population. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Claim: Secret radiation experiments were conducted</b>. 
</p>
<p>
Our findings: Dr. Neel did not conduct any radiation studies with the Yanomami. 
In 1962 and 1968 a physician named Marcel Roche conducted a population study of 
thyroid uptake in the lowlands of Venezuela and high in the Andes showing that 
at very high altitudes there was a uniformly higher thyroid radioiodine uptake. 
This study used proper doses of radioiodine (I-131). Use of radioiodine was then 
and remains today a commonly used diagnostic tool to measure pathological conditions 
including thyroid function.

Deficiency Without Goiter in Isolated Yanomama Indians: A Preliminary Note". In: 
<i>Biomedical Challenges Presented by the American Indian</i>. Pan American Health 
Organization/World Health Organization, September 1968, pp 120-123.) 
</p>
</font> 
<p>
Dr. Neel was well-known for his extensive and humanitarian study on the aftereffects 
of atomic radiation on survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and their children. 
A review of Dr. Neel's field journal and daily logs makes it clear that he never 
conducted any "secret radiation" studies. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Claim: The e-mail suggests that Mr. Tierney documents that Dr. Neel held extreme 
eugenic theories.</b> 
</p>
<p>
Our findings: Dr. Neel's published works show that he was a critic of eugenics 
from his graduate student days in the late 1930s. Far from holding "eugenics" 
positions, Dr. Neel strongly supported maintaining the rich diversity of the entire 
human gene pool and urged "egalitarian control of population growth" to protect 
the future of our species. [See: James V. Neel, <i>Physician to the Gene Pool: 
Genetic Lessons and Other Stories</i> (New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1994)]. 
He championed the view that each individual be able to maximize genetic potential; 
this is a far cry from eugenic efforts to "improve" the species through reproductive 
theory and policy. His work with the Yanomami helped them survive the pre-existing 
measles outbreak and was a humanitarian act by a compassionate physician. 
</p>
<p>
Allegations, particularly those involving academic work of highly distinguished 
scholars in their field, require a fair and proper peer review -- not a sensationalized 
public discussion in the headlines and over the Internet. 
</p>
<p>
We are now beginning to review in detail the allegations in the galley proofs 
and investigating the evidence and documentation the author uses as the basis 
for his claims. We are reviewing all of the original source materials we have 
available to us, including Dr. Neel's own research logs and field notes. We are 
considering additional steps including asking outside experts to evaluate the 
allegations.

<b><u><font size=4> 
<p>
Part 2 of University of Michigan&#146;s Ongoing Investigation 
</p>
</font></u></b> 
<p>
Following is a statement from the University of Michigan regarding the allegations 
against Napoleon Chagnon in the book <b><u>Darkness in El Dorado</u></b> by Patrick 
Tierney (forthcoming on November 16, 2000 from W.W. Norton &amp; Co.). We have 
now obtained galley proofs of the book. We are also responding to the allegations 
made in a letter from two reviewers: Terence Turner of Cornell University and 
Leslie Sponsel of the University of Hawaii-Manoa. 
</p>
<p>
The University of Michigan takes such allegations of impropriety very seriously 
and thus we have begun an internal inquiry. In the short time we have had to investigate 
these allegations, we have already found materials that <b>directly contradict 
the allegations</b> made against Dr. Neel, Dr. Chagnon, and Dr. Timothy Asch (both 
Neel and Asch are deceased and unable to defend themselves). It is now clear that 
the book contains numerous errors and inaccurately presents the work of Chagnon 
and Neel. 
</p>
<p>
We believe that Mr. Tierney has not consulted important original source materials 
that were available for study. <b>Analyses of those source materials by specialists 
and experts refute the allegations</b>. 
</p>
<p>
Allegations, particularly those involving academic work of highly distinguished 
scholars in their field, require a fair and open-minded peer review &#150;not 
a sensationalized public discussion in the headlines and over the Internet. 
</p>
<b> 
<p>
Claim: Dr. Napoleon Chagnon staged the violence in the film called &quot;The Ax 
Fight,&quot; which depicts Yanomami fighting. 
</p>
</b> 
<p>
The director of the film, <b>The Ax Fight</b>, was Timothy Asch. No documentary 
film analyst we have consulted believes that any part of<b> The Ax Fight</b> film 
was staged, and Dr. Chagnon, who was an eyewitness, rejects the allegation. 
</p>
<p>
Dr. Peter Biella, of the Department of Anthropology at San Francisco State University, 
has studied this film extensively for several years and laments &quot;that Asch 
is not alive to defend himself.&quot; Biella says: &quot;the film&#146;s structure, 
as I argue in my introduction to the Yanomami Interactive CD (a study of <b>The</b> 
<b>Ax Fight</b> film), bends over backwards to qualify and reject stereotypic 
impressions of irrepressible Yanomami violence. The film is about ways that violence 
is muted, restrained, and non-fatal. Essentially it argues that without police, 
Yanomami manage to make their system of dispute settlement work pretty well, with 
nobody in this case getting very hurt.&quot; Biella has published transcripts 
of tape recordings of Chagnon in 1971 in support of his statement that &quot;the 
1971 taped evidence confirms that at first Chagnon knew virtually nothing about 
the origins of the fight.&quot; Dr. Biella and a co-author (Dr. Gary Seaman, Director 
of the Center of Visual Anthropology at the University of Southern California) 
plan to submit a lengthier analysis of <b>The</b> <b>Ax Fight</b> to the <i>American 
Anthropological Association Newsletter</i> with all the reasons why they believe 
<b>The Ax Fight</b> was not staged. Biella gives several cogent reasons why <b>&quot;the 
criticism that The Ax Fight was staged for the camera strikes me as obviously 
and manifestly untrue&quot;.</b> 
</p>
<p>
Dr. Gregory A. Finnegan of Harvard University has extensive background in visual 
anthropology. Dr. Finnegan was originally a student of Dr. Timothy Asch (when 
Asch was teaching at Brandeis University). Finnegan also does not believe <b>The 
Ax Fight</b> film was staged, pointing out that the fight was already in progress 
when the crewman doing the sound recording was in his first full day among the 
Yanomami. He adds that the film&#146;s dialogue indicates that Chagnon himself 
was so taken by surprise by the fight that he was initially confused about the 
reasons for the fighting; at first, he says on camera that he had been told it 
was over &quot;incest.&quot; Only later did Chagnon and Asch discover that the 
fight grew out of &quot;political tensions in a fissioning lineage.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
Dr. Alexander Moore, Chair of the University of Southern California&#146;s Department 
of Anthropology, notes that the television show NOVA did stage a film of a Yanomami 
feast, and for that purpose an entire communal long house was built. However, 
neither Asch nor Chagnon were involved in that NOVA production. It may be that 
Tierney has confused the NOVA production with the earlier films of Asch and Chagnon, 
none of which were staged. [For information on obtaining a copy of the Interactive 
CD on the Yanomami <b>Ax Fight</b> film, contact <i>biella@sfsu.edu</i>]. 
</p>
<b> 
<p>
Claim: Chagnon himself is directly or indirectly responsible for endemic warfare 
among the Yanomami. 
</p>
</b> 
<p>
This claim is among the easiest to refute, especially since there is an extensive 
history on the topic. Warfare among Indian groups in South America goes back a 
minimum of 3,500 years. Abundant archaeological data show raiding, including the 
saving of trophy heads, throughout the pre-Hispanic periods called Chavin, Moche, 
Chimu, Wari, and Inka. Warfare was also reported by the Spanish conquerors of 
the sixteenth century A.D. 
</p>
<p>
In the specific case of the Yanomami, our first report about these people is from 
the mid-1800s, by Moritz Schomburgk (1847-1848). Then sometime between 1875 and 
1910, we have reports that women had been acquired by Yanomami raiding (Peters 
1998:167-168). In 1911 Theodor Koch-Grunberg (1923) described the Yanomami as 
&quot;very warlike people who succeeded in dominating several weaker tribes.&quot; 
The year 1931 is given as the year a war occurred between two Yanomami subgroups, 
the Xilixana and the Macu; 1935 as the year of the war between the Xilixana and 
the Yekwana; and 1946 as the year of a major epidemic (Peters 1998:167-168). Particularly 
illuminating is the story of Helena Valero, a woman of Spanish descent born in 
1925 and captured in a Yanomami raid in 1937. Her biography is filled with data 
showing how fierce and brutal some Yanomami could be when abducting women from 
other villages as wives (Biocca 1971). These and many other accounts, too numerous 
to mention here, make the claim that Yanomami violence began with Chagnon&#146;s 
arrival obviously false.

<p>
Claim: Chagnon&#146;s characterization of the Yanomami as &quot;fierce people&quot; 
encouraged 40,000 invading gold miners to use violence against them between 1980-1987. 
</p>
</b> 
<p>
We have already established that Chagnon was not the first author to describe 
the Yanomami as violent. In fact, critics who have accused him of this characterization 
forget that the Yanomami refer to themselves as <i>waitiri,</i> &quot;fierce and 
valiant.&quot; What Chagnon did was translate the term into English. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Given that the behavior of miners toward indigenous people during &quot;gold rushes&quot; 
in the 1850s and 1860s in places like California and Australia was similar to 
that seen in the 1980s in the Amazon, the idea that Chagnon is responsible for 
such behavior is not plausible. Published accounts of Yanomami violence had preceded 
Chagnon&#146;s arrival by a considerable length of time. Thus it seems much more 
plausible that the miners were familiar with sensationalized newspaper articles 
on Yanomami warfare than that they had spent time reading the anthropological 
literature. 
</p>
<p>
Below is just a sample of the extensive literature on the effects of gold mining 
in the Yanomami area. [Bruce Albert &quot;Gold Miners and Yanomami Indians in 
the Brazilian Amazon: The Hashimu Massacre.&quot; Published in Portuguese October 
10, 1993 in <b>Folha de Sao Paulo</b>, Brasilia; Jed Greer (1993), &#145;The Price

</p>
<p>
</p>
<b> 
<p>
Claim: Turner and Sponsel learned of this &quot;impending scandal&quot; from reading 
the galley proofs of Tierney&#146;s book. 
</p>
</b> 
<p>
While the now-famous e-mail letter to the AAA by Turner and Sponsel leaves the 
impression that they had just learned of the accusations against Neel and Chagnon, 
there is published evidence that they knew about them long before (see Part 3). 
The first piece of evidence is that both Turner and Sponsel are thanked in the 
&quot;Acknowledgments&quot; section of Tierney&#146;s book, which indicates that 
they read it long before the galley stage. A second piece of evidence is that 
Tierney&#146;s book cites a 1995 interview with Terence Turner. 
</p>
<p>
Evidence indicating that Leslie Sponsel knew of Tierney&#146;s book and its contents 
can be found in the bibliography of a 1998 article by Sponsel. In the journal 
<b><u>Aggressive Behavior</u></b>,Vol. 24, Sponsel has a paper entitled &quot;Yanomami: 
An Arena of Conflict and Aggression in the Amazon.&quot; In this paper, Sponsel 
discusses 10 major areas of disagreement with Chagnon and makes allegations not 
unlike those in the Turner-Sponsel letter to the AAA. Sponsel&#146;s bibliography 
also includes a reference on page 122 to a book by Tierney, as follows: 
</p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p>
    <font size=2>Tierney P (forthcoming): </font><b>Last Tribes of El Dorado: 
    The Gold Wars in the Amazon Rainforest</b> 
    </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>
It would seem that this is the same manuscript cited in a second published source, 
<b>Life Among the Yanomami</b>, a book by John F. Peters (Broadview Press, 1998). 
Peters, however, cites Tierney&#146;s manuscript as follows: 
</p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p>
    <font size=2>&#9;</font>Tierney, Pat. 1997. <b>The Last Tribes of Dorado</b>. 
    New York: Viking. 
    </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>
Borders Bookstore advises us that their records showed that this book, originally 
scheduled for publication by Viking Press, never appeared in print for reasons 
unspecified. At the very least, there is evidence to suggest that Peters and Sponsel 
had read a version of Tierney&#146;s book prior to 1998. 
</p>
<p>
It would appear that this same book is now to be offered for sale by W.W. Norton, 
under the title<b> <u>Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and Journalists Devastated 
the Amazon</u></b>. We find it significant that the subtitle changed from an emphasis 
on gold mining to an emphasis on alleged scientific and journalistic misdeeds 
between 1997 and 2000, exactly the period Turner and Sponsel seem to have been 
in contact with Tierney. 
</p>
<p>
An interesting paper trail, leading back at least to 1993, reveals a history of 
published attacks on Chagnon, some of which sound remarkably similar to those 
attributed to Tierney. In that year several anthropologists, including Terence 
Turner and Eric Wolf, received an anonymous packet of materials in the mail that 
attacked and impugned Chagnon&#146;s character. 
</p>
<p>
Two distinguished anthropologists sprang to Chagnon&#146;s defense in the March 
issue of the AAA newsletter. Eric Wolf (Distinguished Professor, CUNY-Lehman) 
(1994:2) says: 
</p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p>
    &quot;Anthropologists need to arm themselves professionally and ethically 
    against such dubious practices of anonymous character assassination, directed 
    in this case against an anthropologist who has built up an exemplary body 
    of data through long-term and often difficult fieldwork. Even those among 
    Chagnon&#146;s colleagues who might disagree with his Neo-Darwinian premises 
    (and these include the present writer) acknowledge his extraordinary devotion 
    to anthropology as a science, which has provided us also with the information 
    that allows us to debate his interpretations and suggest possible alternatives. 
    This was recognized most recently in a meeting devoted to Chagnon&#146;s work 
    at the New York Academy of Sciences on September 27, 1993. &#133; The search 
    for relevant questions and good answers should not be inhibited by demonization.&quot; 
    </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>
Another distinguished professor, Robin Fox (Rutgers University) (1994:2), says: 
</p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p>
    &quot;American anthropologists, both individually and through their organization, 
    should rally to the support of Chagnon and the absolute value of his courageous 
    and brilliant field studies of Yanomami culture as well as his practical efforts 
    to save it.&quot; 
    </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>
According to the May 1994 issue of the <i>Newsletter </i>of the American Anthropological 
Association, &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; suggests that this anonymous 
packet came from supporters of the Salesian Missions, a group of missionaries 
who have long maintained a mission among the Yanomami. These missionaries have 
been feuding with Chagnon since he denounced them for two practices: (1) encouraging 
the Indians to aggregate near the mission, which Chagnon and others feel exposes 
them to Western diseases, and (2) giving the Yanomami gifts of shotguns which, 
although intended for hunting, were also used for warfare. It is clear that this 
packet was intended to defame Chagnon (see Part 3 of this report). 
</p>
<p>
In the same May 1994 issue of the <i>AAA Newsletter</i>, Turner criticizes the 
version of events given by Chagnon, Wolf, and Fox. In his commentary, Turner further 
alleges that Chagnon is linked to Charles Brewer-Carias of the University of California 
at Santa Barbara, a Venezuelan naturalist whom Turner describes as &quot;an ex-Cabinet 
Minister with extensive interests in gold mining.&quot; It is here, in Turner&#146;s 
1994 commentary, that we first see allegations linking Chagnon and Brewer-Carias 
to clandestine gold mining in Yanomami country. Thus it is far more likely that 
Tierney learned of these allegations from Turner than the reverse. 
</p>
<p>
In the September 1994 issue of the same <i>AAA Newsletter</i>, Chagnon and Brewer-Carias 
respond to Turner&#146;s allegations as well as the anonymously mailed packet. 
They assert that Brewer-Carias has a record of 30 years of scientific work and 
has never explored for gold in the Yanomami area (or in any other area occupied 
by indigenous peoples). Chagnon and Brewer-Carias also expand on their concern 
over the practice of providing guns and ammunition to the Yanomami. 
</p>
<p>
It would thus appear that the accusations against Chagnon in Tierney&#146;s forthcoming 
book were known to both Turner and Sponsel long before that book reached the galley 
proof stage. Some allegations had already been made in print by Turner as far 
back as 1994, and others in print by Sponsel in 1998. The accusations are part 
of a long-standing academic feud that shows no sign of diminishing, rather than 
recent discoveries by an investigative reporter.

Part 3 of University of Michigan&#146;s Ongoing Investigation 
</p>
</font> 
<p>
Allegations against Neel and Chagnon made by Tierney, Turner, and Sponsel: 
</p>
<p>
An Investigation of Motives and Agendas 
</p>
</u></b> 
<p>
The University of Michigan takes allegations of impropriety very seriously. Such 
allegations have been made against Drs. James Neel and Dr. Napoleon Chagnon in 
two sources: (1) galley proofs of the book <b><u>Darkness in El Dorado</u></b> 
by Patrick Tierney (forthcoming from W.W. Norton &amp; Co. on November 16, 2000); 
and (2) a widely circulated e-mail letter from two anthropologists, Drs. Terence 
Turner of Cornell University and Leslie Sponsel of the University of Hawaii-Manoa, 
who are thanked in Tierney&#146;s acknowledgments for providing him with comments 
and encouragement. 
</p>
<p>
In two previous statements (Parts 1 and 2) related to our ongoing investigation 
we have presented published source materials, as well as expert testimony from 
geneticists, physicians, epidemiologists, medical researchers, anthropologists, 
documentary film specialists, and eyewitnesses who accompanied Drs. Neel and Chagnon 
to the territory of the Yanomami people. This body of material collected by our 
team of investigators refutes most claims made by Turner and Sponsel, as well 
as those already reported by scholars who have now read the galley proofs of Tierney&#146;s 
book. 
</p>
<p>
Given that the allegations are untrue, what possible motives would Tierney, Turner, 
and Sponsel have for making them? As suggested in our second statement, a long 
paper trail reveals that most of the allegations are not new, but part of ongoing 
feuds between Chagnon and two sets of detractors: 
</p>
<p>
1. A group of anthropologists who are passionately opposed to Chagnon&#146;s use 
of neo-Darwinian theory to explain Yanomami violence. 
</p>
<p>
2. A group of missionaries who view Chagnon&#146;s presence in Venezuela as a 
threat to their own agenda for the Yanomami. 
</p>

1. Science vs Anti-science and the &quot;Moral Agenda&quot;: 
</p>
<p>
A Source of Friction in Anthropology 
</p>
</font></u></b><font size=2> </font> 
<p>
During the last two decades, a schism has developed between anthropologists who 
believe in a scientific paradigm and those who do not. The first major casualty 
of that schism was Stanford University&#146;s Anthropology Department, which recently 
split into two departments: one of &quot;Anthropological Sciences&quot; and one 
of &quot;Cultural and Social Anthropology.&quot; Citing Gerald Holton&#146;s <i>The 
Anti-Science Phenomenon</i> (1993), University of Missouri anthropologist Robert 
Benfer (1996) describes &quot;science&quot; as objective, quantitative, extrapersonalized, 
and based on proof and consensus; &quot;anti-science&quot; is subjective, qualitative, 
personalized, moralistic, and based on individual authority with no accommodation 
of contrary views. 
</p>
<p>
A further development within anti-scientific anthropology has been the growth 
of a &quot;militant&quot; or &quot;politically committed and morally engaged anthropology&quot; 
(Scheper-Hughes 1995) which grew out of the moralistic aspects of anti-science. 
Anthropologist Roy D&#146;Andrade of UC-San Diego describes this as an effort 
to abandon objective models of the world and change anthropology to a discipline 
based on moral models. Anthropology&#146;s purpose then becomes &quot;to identify 
what is <i>good</i> and what is <i>bad </i>and to allocate<i> reward </i>and<i> 
punishment&quot; </i>(D&#146;Andrade 1995:399). In such an approach, debate is 
not closed by the discovery of the truth, but by the most powerful group&#146;s 
exclusion of their rivals from the community of scholars. D&#146;Andrade calls 
such an approach &quot;estheticized journalism and moralistic pamphleteering&quot; 
and suggests that it can be more easily replaced than scientific anthropology. 
Moral engagement against military dictatorships seems appropriate; against &quot;the 
guy in the office down the hall,&quot; it seems inappropriate. 
</p>
<p>
In Turner and Sponsel&#146;s letter, moralistic phrases such as &quot;sheer criminality 
and corruption ... unparalleled in the history of anthropology&quot; leave no 
doubt as to which side of the debate they occupy. However, their individual agendas 
are somewhat different.

2. Leslie Sponsel&#146;s Agenda 
</p>
</font></u></b> 
<p>
Two recent essays by Sponsel (1996, 1998) reveal the source of his antipathy toward 
Chagnon. Sponsel is committed to what he calls &quot;the anthropology of peace,&quot; 
and his agenda seems to be the promotion of a &quot;more nonviolent and peaceful 
world,&quot; a world he believes is &quot;latent in human nature&quot; (Sponsel 
1996:115). He opposes what he calls the &quot;Darwinian emphasis on violence and 
competition&quot; (1996:99), and remains convinced that &quot;<i>nonviolence and 
peace were likely the norm throughout most of human prehistory and that intrahuman 
killing was probably rare</i>&quot; (1996:103). In both essays, Sponsel reveals 
his anti-science position by referring to any kind of quantification or statistics 
as &quot;magic.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
Sponsel was taken aback when Chagnon published a study showing that Yanomami men 
who had killed enemies in raids tended to have more wives and children than men 
who had not (Chagnon 1988). He had to be especially troubled by Chagnon&#146;s 
neo-Darwinian suggestion that by becoming a warrior who had killed, a man might 
have increased his genetic fitness. Even more disturbing was Chagnon&#146;s conclusion 
that violence was so potent a factor in human society that it &quot;may be the 
principal driving force behind the evolution of culture&quot; (Chagnon 1988:985). 
</p>
<p>
It is the &quot;political incorrectness&quot; of Chagnon&#146;s position that 
seems to bother Sponsel the most; by raising the possibility that violence is 
part of human nature rather than a pathology, Chagnon undermines the moral activists&#146; 
efforts to promote a less violent world. Sponsel (1998:114) also admits that much 
of the criticism of Chagnon results from <i>biophobia</i>, which he defines as 
&quot;an almost automatic reaction against any biological explanation of human 
behavior, the possibility of biological reductionism, and the associated political 
implications.&quot; Clearly it is the &quot;political implications&quot; that 
most annoy those with a moralizing agenda. To borrow D&#146;Andrade&#146;s terminology, 
Chagnon&#146;s ideas are &quot;bad&quot; and he deserves to be &quot;punished.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
Such punishment begins with efforts to blame Chagnon&#146;s book for unflattering 
descriptions of the Yanomami in the Brazilian press, and ultimately to blame him 
for the destruction being committed by tens of thousands of gold prospectors now 
flooding Yanomami country (Sponsel 1998:105). When we look for the written sources 
of Sponsel&#146;s allegations, however, we see that they come from two less than 
unbiased sources: the Salesian missionaries with whom Chagnon is feuding (see 
below), and an earlier version of Tierney&#146;s book which Viking Press decided 
not to publish even though production had proceeded so far that in 1995 it had 
been assigned the ISBN number 067083372X. 
</p>
<p>
A more even-handed view than that presented by Tierney or Sponsel would admit 
that Chagnon does not portray the Yanomami as living in a state of unrelenting 
war, i.e. they conduct only periodic raiding. Nor are Chagnon&#146;s data showing 
that men who have killed tend to have more wives and children &quot;simply not 
true,&quot; as Turner and Sponsel claim; a similar correlation has recently been 
found among the Waorani of Ecuador by Clayton and Carole Robarchek of Wichita 
State University (Robarchek and Robarchek 1998). The Robarcheks acknowledge this 
correlation, but present an alternative (and non-Darwinian) explanation for the 
phenomenon. In presenting an alternative hypothesis, the Robarcheks take a more 
reasonable approach than simply defaming Chagnon. Ironically, if Chagnon&#146;s 
1988 comment had read simply, &quot;violence may be <i><u>one of several variables</u></i> 
involved in the evolution of culture,&quot; hundreds of anthropologists would 
probably have accepted it without biophobia. It is worth noting that a 1996 book 
by Lawrence Keeley of the University of Illinois at Chicago (<i>War before Civilization: 
The Myth of the Peaceful Savage</i>) disputes Sponsel&#146;s notion that nonviolence 
was the norm in prehistory, a view Keeley calls &quot;the pacification of the 
past.&quot;

3. Chagnon&#146;s &quot;Turf War&quot; with the Salesian Missionaries 
</p>
</font></u></b> 
<p>
The Salesians of Don Bosco are a Catholic missionary order who, according to their 
own website, arrived in Venezuela in 1894. In 1933 the Holy See entrusted them 
with a Vicariate in the Upper Orinoco wherein live the Yanomami. 
</p>
<p>
The Yanomami have traditionally been shifting cultivators, moving their villages 
periodically when the surrounding lands need to lie fallow until their fertility 
has been restored. The stated policy of the Salesians, however, is to encourage 
the Yanomami to settle around the mission (Cappelletti 1994). This policy led 
to angry exchanges between Chagnon and some of the missionaries, each claiming 
that he had the best interests of the Yanomami at heart. 
</p>
<p>
This &quot;turf war&quot; has been investigated by anthropologist Frank A. Salamone 
of Iona College (Salamone 1996, 1997). While his trip to Venezuela was paid for 
by the Salesians, Salamone tried his best to be an impartial observer. The issues 
are so complex and the situation so byzantine that the University of Michigan 
investigative team can only present a very simplified version in this short report. 
In essence, Chagnon was able to document that those Yanomami concentrated in permanent 
villages near the Salesian missions had a higher death rate than those in more 
distant and widely spaced shifting settlements; he attributed this to (1) the 
fact that the missions were portals for Western diseases, and (2) the likelihood 
that game was depleted by overhunting near permanent settlements, leading to protein 
shortage. Chagnon was also convinced that the missionaries were providing the 
Yanomami with firearms which, although intended for hunting, were eventually used 
against rival villagers. Chagnon reported as early as 1966 that the Salesians 
were luring Yanomami to their mission at Mavaca by providing them with shotguns. 
It is also clear that someone has been providing the Yanomami with rifles; Salamone 
(1997:8) believes that the rifles were obtained indirectly, as follows: 
</p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <dir> 
      <p>
      &quot;The Yanomami cooperative SUYAO had sold rifles which they obtained 
      from the missionaries, the total was either five or six depending on the 
      person relating the tale. All agree that the Salesians put a stop to the 
      practice, anticipating that the rifles might be used for warfare.&quot; 
      </p>
    </dir>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>
Disputes between Chagnon and the Salesians escalated during 1993 when 16 or 17 
Yanomami were massacred by illegal Brazilian gold miners (Salamone 1997:1). Chagnon 
was named to a Venezuelan Presidential Commission to investigate the massacre, 
but soon encountered opposition from the Salesians and their supporters. One of 
the problems was that the commission included the Venezuelan naturalist Charles 
Brewer-Carias. Because Brewer-Carias apparently had mining interests elsewhere 
in Amazonia, he was deemed to have a conflict of interest; Venezuelan journalists 
even accused Brewer-Carias of using botanical field trips as a front for gold 
prospecting. A new Presidential Commission was named and one of its members, the 
Bishop of Amazonas, ordered Chagnon and Brewer-Carias out of the region. 
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that Chagnon himself has never been shown to have any interest 
whatsoever in gold mining. The basis of Tierney&#146;s allegation that (in Turner 
and Sponsel&#146;s words) Chagnon and Neel colluded with &quot;sinister Venezuelan 
politicians&quot; to gain control of Yanomami land for &quot;illegal gold mining 
concessions&quot; consists solely of guilt by association with Brewer-Carias. 
We have found no evidence that Chagnon owns a mine in the Orinoco or anywhere. 
</p>
<p>
Later in 1993, supporters of the Salesian missionaries began anonymously to mail 
out packets of material intended to defame Chagnon. Many such packets were mailed 
to anthropologists and funding agencies, timed to arrive just before the 1993 
meetings of the American Anthropological Association in Washington D.C. It is 
clear that anthropologists sympathetic to the Salesians (or angry with Chagnon) 
had supplied the addresses, some of which were the home addresses of anthropologists. 
These are the anonymous packets which (in Part 2 of this report) were denounced 
by Eric Wolf as an attempt to &quot;demonize&quot; anthropologists. 
</p>
<p>
According to Salamone (1997:17), the Salesians also placed packets of these defamatory 
materials on a table where &quot;free literature&quot; was distributed at the 
1993 AAA meetings in Washington. When Salamone spoke to Father Edward Cappelletti, 
director of the missions, about this, he found there was &quot;no argument [Salamone] 
could put forth that moved [Cappelletti] to consider how repugnant anonymous accusations 
were to American academics&quot; (1997:17). With difficulty, Salamone persuaded 
Cappelletti not to &quot;hire a psychologist to do a profile on Chagnon,&quot; 
a study for which &quot;Cappelletti ranted that he would spend $20,000&quot; (Salamone 
1997: Endnote 13). 
</p>
<p>
Such animosity escalated to the point where, in March of 1994, anthropologist 
Dr. Kim Hill (University of New Mexico) announced that he had personally witnessed 
Salesians &quot;coaching&quot; Yanomami to defame Chagnon (Hill 1994). In the 
same letter, Hill reports that he saw the Salesians rehearsing missionized Yanomami 
whom they had chosen to serve as puppet &quot;leaders&quot; for their people. 
In a case of supreme irony, Hill reports, &quot;Yanomamo whose lives were saved 
in the 1968 measles epidemic&quot; thanks to Neel and Chagnon&#146;s vaccination 
program were being coached to denounce Chagnon &quot;because he sometimes assists 
medical personnel.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
Finally, in an effort to make peace, Chagnon and Father Jose Bortoli of the Salesian 
missions agreed to meet at the 1994 American Anthropological Association meetings 
in Atlanta (Salamone 1997:1). The two were old friends, and after each had spoken 
at a session on Anthropology and Theology arranged by Salamone, they shook hands 
and declared a truce. &quot;At root the Salesian-Chagnon dispute was a fraternal 
struggle,&quot; reports Salamone (1997:27), with one branch of the family seeking 
truth through empirical methods, the other through a metaphysical method. All 
agreed that in the future the Yanomami should speak for themselves. 
</p>
<p>
Had all observers similarly agreed to disagree, the defamatory attacks on Chagnon 
might have ended in 1994. However, recall Roy D&#146;Andrade&#146;s (1995) observation 
that in the case of &quot;militant, morally engaged&quot; anthropologists, debate 
is not closed until those with &quot;bad&quot; ideas have been punished, literally 
excluded from the community of scholars. Some of Chagnon&#146;s detractors were 
not satisfied by his truce with Father Bortoli because it left Chagnon insufficiently 
punished; among them, evidently, were Terence Turner and Patrick Tierney (see 
below).

<p>
4. Terence Turner&#146;s Agenda 
</p>
</font></u></b> 
<p>
Every expert witness we have consulted considers Terence Turner to be Chagnon&#146;s 
most passionate adversary. He is perhaps the prototypic &quot;militant, morally 
engaged&quot; anthropologist, with especially ferocious dedication to the rights 
of threatened indigenous people. His belief that he is on the moral high ground 
has been at least twice reinforced: (1) by being named head of the American Anthropological 
Association&#146;s Special Commission to Investigate the Brazilian Yanomami in 
1990-1991, and (2) by serving with Sponsel on the AAA Committee for Human Rights 
later in the 1990s. (The importance of these posts to Turner and Sponsel is reflected 
in the fact that they still list them in their famous e-mail even though their 
terms have expired.) 
</p>
<p>
Turner appears from his writings to believe virtually every bad thing he has heard 
about Chagnon, whether from the Salesian missionaries, the missionized and &quot;coached&quot; 
Yanomami described in Hill&#146;s letter, a disgruntled former student of Chagnon&#146;s, 
or Chagnon&#146;s professional rivals. Because Turner has co-authored a statement 
in the periodical <i>Cultural Survival</i> with Davi Kopinawa &#150; an acculturated 
Brazilian Yanomami whom he regards as &quot;the most effective spokesman for many 
of the general interests of the Yanomami to the outside world&quot; &#150; he 
feels qualified to denounce Chagnon on behalf of the Yanomami. Many of Turner&#146;s 
earlier charges are repeated in his e-mail with Sponsel, and center on his belief 
that Chagnon&#146;s published portrayal of the Yanomami as fierce and violent 
has actually endangered them. 
</p>
<p>
In fairness to Turner, his fears are shared by many anthropologists who are concerned 
with the survival and welfare of the Yanomami. What sets Turner apart from Chagnon&#146;s 
other critics is the intensity of his anger, which eyewitnesses say included interrupting 
Chagnon with a tirade during the 1994 &quot;truce&quot; session with Father Bortoli. 
Salamone (1997:14-15) reports that Turner has accused Chagnon of &quot;unconscionable 
slandering of those helping the Yanomami&quot; and has labeled Chagnon &quot;a 
sociopath&quot; and &quot;a liar whose lies damage the Yanomami.&quot; This clearly 
goes beyond normal professional disagreement; it suggests that phrases in the 
Turner-Sponsel letter like &quot;sheer criminality and corruption ... unparalleled 
in the history of Anthropology&quot; probably originated with Turner rather than 
Tierney. Tierney&#146;s galley proofs also reveal that Turner had disliked Neel&#146;s 
research since 1963, attributing to Neel a &quot;leadership gene&quot; theory 
which Tierney admits can be found nowhere in Neel&#146;s own writings. 
</p>
<p>
Salamone (1997:15) points out that contrary to Turner&#146;s allegations, Chagnon 
himself <b><u>has</u></b> repudiated the misuse of his Yanomami data by others; 
he did so in the 1983 version of his book <u>Yanomamo: the Fierce People</u>. 
It appears, however, that nothing will satisfy Turner short of punishment for 
Chagnon. 
</p>
<p>
In an earlier statement, our investigative team noted three interesting facts: 
(1) Turner was one of the anthropologists to receive an anonymous packet of defamatory 
material from the supporters of the Salesians in 1993; (2) many of the allegations 
in the packet are repeated in Tierney&#146;s book; and (3) it was during the period 
that Turner and Sponsel were &quot;encouraging&quot; him that the subtitle of 
Tierney&#146;s book changed from an attack on &quot;gold miners&quot; to an attack 
on &quot;scientists.&quot; We leave it to the reader to decide whether supplying 
Tierney with defamatory material on Chagnon was part of Turner&#146;s effort to 
punish Chagnon. 
</p>
<b><u><font size=4> 
<p>
5. Patrick Tierney&#146;s Agenda 
</p>
</font></u></b> 
<p>
Tierney&#146;s earlier book, <b><i><u>The Highest Altar</u></i></b> (Viking, 1989) 
established a pattern of sensationalizing anthropological themes; anthropologists 
working in the Andes of southern Peru dispute his claim that late 20<sup>th</sup> 
century Aymara villagers are still practicing prehispanic-style human sacrifices. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
While Tierney is usually described as a journalist, he took Anthropology at UCLA 
and is presumably familiar with the &quot;militant, morally engaged&quot; anti-science 
agenda. Indeed, on page XXIV of the galleys for <b><u>Darkness in El Dorado</u></b> 
he states that while among the Yanomami, &quot;I gradually changed from being 
an observer to being an advocate ... traditional, objective journalism was no 
longer an option for me.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
We would agree, since an examination of Tierney&#146;s <i>Acknowledgment</i> section 
does not suggest that the goal of his book was balanced or objective journalism. 
Almost without exception his informants were detractors of Chagnon, who seems 
to be the main target of his volume and is seen as having few redeeming qualities. 
Had Tierney kept to his original plan of exposing the detrimental effect of 40,000 
gold miners on the Yanomami, <b><u>Darkness in El Dorado</u></b> might well have 
been a contribution. When he overextends himself to blame Chagnon not only for 
the gold miners but also for measles epidemics and Venezuelan government corruption, 
he strains credulity. At that point his book becomes, to borrow D&#146;Andrade&#146;s 
phrase, &quot;moralistic pamphleteering&quot; like that of the most extreme anti-science 
anthropologists. 
</p>
<p>
The galley proofs of Tierney&#146;s book are now being analyzed on web sites at 
major universities. Scholars have already pointed to several disturbing aspects 
of the book. One is a series of <i>ad hominem</i> comments on Chagnon&#146;s personal 
appearance and his impoverished childhood in rural Michigan. A second disturbing 
trend is Tierney&#146;s repeating of third-hand malicious gossip. He claims that 
Mark Andrew Ritchie, a novelist and traveler to the Orinoco, told him that a Yanomami 
told Ritchie that Chagnon once wanted to buy a Yanomami wife. Chagnon has <i>never</i> 
had a Yanomami wife, and those who know him best describe him as &quot;devotedly 
monogamous&quot; (confusion may result from the fact that one of Chagnon&#146;s 
former students did once have a Yanomami wife). As an example of how such unsubstantiated 
gossip can become embellished, the Turner-Sponsel letter escalates this comment 
by Tierney into &quot;passing references to Chagnon himself demanding that the 
villagers bring him girls for sex.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
Third, there are efforts to prove that Chagnon &quot;cooked&quot; his data -- 
efforts which suggest that statistics may be as &quot;magical&quot; for Tierney 
as Sponsel describes them. A case in point is Tierney&#146;s &quot;reanalysis&quot; 
of Chagnon&#146;s figures showing that men who killed tended to have more wives. 
Scholars in possession of the galley proofs have rushed to point out that Tierney 
missed a crucial point: it is the number of wives a warrior has <b><i>over the 
entire course of his lifetime, including dead and divorced wives</i></b>, that 
is relevant. By including only surviving wives in his &quot;renanalysis,&quot; 
it was Tierney who did the cooking. Here it is clear that part of Tierney&#146;s 
agenda is to disprove Chagnon&#146;s potential correlation between killing and 
genetic fitness, a clear case of <i>biophobia</i> in Sponsel&#146;s terms. 
</p>
<p>
Fourth, much of Tierney&#146;s evidence seems to come from Latin Amercan newspaper 
articles and personal communications from Chagnon&#146;s long-term detractors. 
</p>
<b><u><font size=4> 
<p>
6. Preliminary Conclusions 
</p>
</font></u></b> 
<p>
The work of the University of Michigan fact-finding team has not ended. We will 
be investigating every allegation in the galleys concerning Drs. Neel and Chagnon. 
However, this seems an appropriate time to offer some tentative and preliminary 
conclusions. 
</p>
<p>
We began this study assuming that, in Turner and Sponsel&#146;s words, we would 
be investigating &quot;an impending scandal&quot; concerning flagrant wrongdoing 
by two celebrated scholars. Almost immediately, however, we discovered published 
evidence that the most serious allegations were false. Neel was not a eugenicist, 
did not cause the 1968 measles epidemic, and did not run nefarious experiments 
on unsuspecting human subjects. What he did was what any responsible physician 
would have done: vaccinate as many people as he could in a circle around the mission 
where the epidemic began. That these facts were available in the medical literature 
30 years ago (Neel et al. 1970) made us wonder why Tierney had so badly distorted 
the facts. Today we realize that it was because he had become an &quot;advocate&quot; 
rather than an objective journalist. 
</p>
<p>
As our work progressed, the major allegations against Chagnon also began to crumble. 
None of Timothy Asch&#146;s films had been staged, nor were any of them designed 
by Chagnon to teach the Yanomami how to be violent. Records of Yanomami violence 
go back long before Chagnon&#146;s birth, and resemble similar records among the 
Jivaro and Waorani. Chagnon is aware that his data on Yanomami violence have been 
misused by others for their own ends, and he repudiated this misuse in 1983. While 
it is certainly legitimate to offer alternatives to Chagnon&#146;s neo-Darwinian 
theoretical framework, it is hardly fair to hold him responsible for a Brazilian 
gold rush or Venezuelan government corruption. By the time we had checked into 
these allegations, we realized that we might actually be dealing with a hoax, 
or with the literary equivalent of a professional &quot;hit.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
We began with the assumption that Turner and Sponsel had just discovered a scandal. 
The more we read, the less the affair looked like a scandal, and the more it looked 
like a professional vendetta that had been going on for years. The anonymous packets 
of defamatory material supplied by supporters of the Salesians played into the 
hands of any anthropologist seeking to demonize Chagnon. But why would anyone 
want to demonize a fellow anthropologist? Clues in the writings of Turner, Sponsel, 
and others led us directly to the rift between scientific and morally engaged 
Anthropology described by D&#146;Andrade and Scheper-Hughes. According to Paul 
Rabinow (1995:432) of UC-Berkeley, 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>
  &quot;... sociobiologists such as Napoleon Chagnon are attacked at meetings 
  of the AAA simply because of their beliefs. These political attacks are motivated 
  by a desire to keep people who have &quot;bad&quot; ideas and who write &quot;bad&quot; 
  things from doing research.&quot; 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Certainly there is room in Anthropology for all kinds of paradigms &#150; neo-Darwinian, 
Marxist, structuralist, postmodern, politically engaged, and whatever may come 
next. And all those kinds of anthropologists, in the spirit of Chagnon and Father 
Bortoli, should be able to shake hands and cordially agree to disagree. The problem 
comes when extreme moralists believe that debate can only end when their opponents 
are denounced, demonized, and driven from the community into silence. While we 
reserve final judgment, it appears to us that this is what <b><u>Darkness in El 
Dorado</u></b> sets out to do. Its targets are science, genetics, and neo-Darwinian 
theory, as exemplified by Neel and Chagnon. 
</p>
<p>
Let us briefly put a human face on the damage done by Turner and Sponsel&#146;s 
widely circulated e-mail. James Neel died in February, leaving a wife and children 
who now have to read newspaper headlines accusing him of genocide. Scholars of 
various universities have received e-mail from developing countries, asking whether 
it is safe to vaccinate their children against measles. Someone should ultimately 
be held responsible for this &quot;collateral damage.&quot;

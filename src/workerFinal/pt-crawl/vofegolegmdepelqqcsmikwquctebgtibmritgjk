This involves cutting greenhouse gases from main sources such as power plants, factories, cars, and farms. Forests, oceans, and soil also absorb and store these gases, and are an important part of the solution. Reducing and avoiding our emissions requires us to reshape everything we do — from how we power our economy and grow our food, to how we travel and live, and the products we consume. It is a problem felt <strong>locally and globally</strong>. </p><p>In the past decades, the <strong>EU took firm action</strong> against climate change, resulting in a more than 31% drop in EU emissions in 2022 compared with 1990 levels. This is mainly a result of a growing use of <strong><a href="/en/topics/in-depth/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a> </strong>and decreased use of carbon-intensive fossil fuels. Improvements in <a href="/en/topics/in-depth/energy-efficiency">energy efficiency</a> and structural changes in the economy also contributed to meeting these goals.</p><p>Now, more ambitious goals are set that include a net <strong>55% or greater reduction </strong>below 1990 levels by 2030 and a climate-neutrality objective by 2050. Reaching these goals will require even higher emission cuts through transitioning from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. It also means <strong>halting deforestation, using land sustainably</strong> and <a href="/en/topics/in-depth/nature-protection-and-restoration"><strong>r</strong><strong>estoring nature</strong></a> until we reach the point where the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is balanced with the capture and storage of these gases in our forests, oceans and soil. </p><p>The EU emits 6% of global emissions and cannot act alone. <strong>Global cooperation</strong> is essential for all climate change mitigation. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the <strong>Paris Agreement</strong> ensure cooperation across borders to tackle climate change and ensure a sustainable future.</p></div></div></div><div class="ui bottom attached segment tab"><div id="Key facts" class="tab-name"><div tabindex="0" role="tabpanel" id="tab-pane-fa515f0c-9ab0-493c-b4cd-58a32dfaae0a"><p>EU Member States have put in place <a href="http://pam.apps.eea.europa.eu/?source=%7B%22track_total_hits%22%3Atrue%2C%22query%22%3A%7B%22match_all%22%3A%7B%7D%7D%2C%22display_type%22%3A%22tabular%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%5B%7B%22Country%22%3A%7B%22order%22%3A%22asc%22%7D%7D%2C%7B%22ID_of_policy_or_measure%22%3A%7B%22order%22%3A%22asc%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22highlight%22%3A%7B%22fields%22%3A%7B%22*%22%3A%7B%7D%7D%7D%7D" rel="noopener">3,000 policies and measures</a><a href="/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-mitigation-reducing-emissions#_ftn1"><sup></sup></a> to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. National climate change <strong>mitigation strategies</strong>, policies and other accompanying measures are also in development.

report</strong>. However, despite gains made in emissions reductions, renewable energy and energy efficiency, the report cautions that accelerated action is urgently needed to meet the EU’s ambitious climate and energy targets. </p><p>The EU has <strong>reduced net greenhouse gas emissions</strong><strong> including international aviation, by 31% compared to 1990 levels</strong>, while simultaneously fostering economic growth. Against the backdrop of soaring natural gas prices, <strong>2022 witnessed </strong><strong>a 2% reduction</strong> in greenhouse gas emissions, driven by substantial decreases in the buildings and industrial sectors, while emissions from energy supply and transport saw an increase. </p><div class="styled-callToActionBlock primary right has--align--right has--theme--primary align styled"><div class="block call-to-action align right"><a class="ui button primary" title="">More on &#x27;Trends and Projections&#x27; package</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="styled-dividerBlock"><div class="ui hidden section divider"></div></div><div class="columns-view"><div class="ui twelve column grid column-grid"><div class="six wide computer twelve wide mobile six wide tablet column column-blocks-wrapper"><h2 id="methane-and-its-warming-potential" data-block="67a97a99-b6e3-4dfc-9c58-1efaf8d6011d"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-mitigation-reducing-emissions#methane-and-its-warming-potential"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="2em" viewBox="0 0 36 36"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M27.1318,7.333 C24.4028,4.604 19.9618,4.604 17.2328,7.333 L12.9898,11.576 C11.8428,12.723 11.1288,14.248 10.9778,15.871 C10.8228,17.541 11.2708,19.211 12.2378,20.576 C12.4818,20.919 12.7278,21.213 12.9888,21.475 C13.7848,22.271 14.7778,22.868 15.8608,23.202 C16.5498,23.415 17.2548,23.519 17.9518,23.518 C19.7808,23.518 21.5598,22.804 22.8888,21.475 L23.9498,20.414 L22.5358,19 L21.4748,20.061 C20.1648,21.371 18.2388,21.842 16.4498,21.291 C15.6668,21.049 14.9778,20.635 14.4038,20.061 C14.2218,19.879 14.0478,19.668 13.8698,19.418 C13.1778,18.443 12.8588,17.249 12.9688,16.056 C13.0768,14.896 13.5868,13.808 14.4038,12.99 L18.6468,8.747 C20.5958,6.798 23.7688,6.798 25.7178,8.747 C26.6568,9.687 27.1748,10.942 27.1748,12.283 C27.1748,13.623 26.6568,14.878 25.7178,15.818 L27.1318,17.232 C28.4488,15.915 29.1748,14.157 29.1748,12.283 C29.1748,10.408 28.4488,8.65 27.1318,7.333"/><path d="M25.0107,16.5254 C24.2147,15.7294 23.2217,15.1324 22.1387,14.7984 C19.6417,14.0284 16.9477,14.6894 15.1107,16.5254 L14.0507,17.5864 L15.4647,19.0004 L16.5247,17.9394 C17.8357,16.6294 19.7587,16.1554 21.5497,16.7094 C22.3337,16.9514 23.0217,17.3644 23.5957,17.9394 C23.7777,18.1214 23.9527,18.3314 24.1307,18.5824 C24.8217,19.5564 25.1417,20.7514 25.0317,21.9444 C24.9237,23.1034 24.4137,24.1924 23.5957,25.0104 L19.3537,29.2534 C17.4047,31.2024 14.2317,31.2024 12.2817,29.2534 C11.3427,28.3134 10.8247,27.0574 10.8247,25.7174 C10.8247,24.3774 11.3427,23.1214 12.2817,22.1824 L10.8677,20.7684 C9.5507,22.0854 8.8247,23.8424 8.8247,25.7174 C8.8247,27.5924 9.5507,29.3504 10.8677,30.6674 C12.2327,32.0314 14.0257,32.7134 15.8177,32.7134 C17.6107,32.7134 19.4027,32.0314 20.7677,30.6674 L25.0107,26.4244 C26.1567,25.2774 26.8717,23.7524 27.0227,22.1294 C27.1777,20.4594 26.7297,18.7894 25.7617,17.4244 C25.5177,17.0814 25.2717,16.7874 25.0107,16.5254"/></g></svg></a>Methane and its warming potential</h2><p>While emissions of methane across the European Union have decreased over past years, the overall <strong>reduction in emissions needs to accelerate </strong>to meet 2030 and 2050 EU climate objectives.

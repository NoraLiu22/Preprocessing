<p>  The green peach aphid, <i>Myzus persicae</i> (Sulzer),  is found throughout the world, including all areas of
  North America, where it is viewed as a pest principally due to its ability to transmit plant viruses.  In
  addition to attacking plants in the field, green peach aphid readily infests vegetables and ornamental
  plants grown in greenhouses.  This allows high levels of survival in areas with inclement weather, and
  favors ready transport on plant material.  When young plants are infested in the greenhouse and then
  transplanted into the field, fields will not only be inoculated with aphids but insecticide resistance may be
  introduced.  These aphids also can be transported long distances by wind and storms.

<h3><a name="life" id="life">Life Cycle and Description </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p>  The life cycle varies considerably, depending on the presence of cold winters.  van Emden et al. (1969)
  provide a good review of the life cycle.  Development can be rapid, often 10 to 12 days for a complete
  generation, and with over 20 annual generations reported in mild climates.  Where suitable host plants
  cannot persist, the aphid overwinters in the egg stage on <i>Prunus</i> spp.  In the spring, soon after the plant breaks dormancy and begins to grow, the eggs hatch and the nymphs feed on flowers, young foliage,
  and stems.  After several generations, winged dispersants from overwintering <i>Prunus</i> spp. deposit
  nymphs on summer hosts.  In cold climates, adults return to <i>Prunus</i> spp. in the autumn, where mating
  occurs, and eggs are deposited.  All generations except the autumn generation culminating in egg
  production are parthenogenetic (non-sexual). In Florida, populations cycle continuously on annual
  plants.
</p>
<p> <b>Eggs:</b> Eggs are deposited on <i>Prunus</i> spp. trees.  The eggs measure about 0.6 mm long and 0.3 mm
  wide, and are elliptical in shape.  Eggs initially are yellow or green, but soon turn black.  Mortality in the
  egg stage sometimes is quite high. </p>
<p> <b>Nymphs:</b> Nymphs initially are greenish, but soon turn yellowish, greatly resembling viviparous
  (parthenogenetic, nymph-producing) adults.  Horsfall (1924) studied the developmental biology of
  viviparous aphids on radish in Pennsylvania.  He reported four instars in this aphid, with the duration of
  each averaging 2.0, 2.1, 2.3, and 2.0 days, respectively.  Females gave birth to offspring six to 17 days
  after birth, with an average age of 10.8 days at first birth.  The length of reproduction varied
  considerably, but averaged 14.8 days.  The average length of life was about 23 days, but this was
  under caged conditions where predators were excluded.  The daily rate of reproduction averaged 1.6
  nymphs per female.  The maximum number of generations observed annually during these studies was
  determined to be 20 to 21, depending on the year.  In contrast, MacGillivray and Anderson (1958)
  reported five instars with a mean development time of 2.4, 1.8, 2.0, 2.1, and 0.7 days, respectively. 
  Further, they reported a mean reproductive period of 20 days, mean total longevity of 41 days, and
  mean fecundity of 75 offspring. </p>

</blockquote>
<p> <b>Adults:</b> Up to 8 generations may occur on <i>Prunus</i> in the spring, but as aphid densities increase
  winged forms are produced, which then disperse to summer hosts.  Winged (alate) aphids have a black
  head and thorax, and a yellowish green abdomen with a large dark patch dorsally.  They measure 1.8
  to 2.1 mm in length.  Winged green peach aphids seemingly attempt to colonize nearly all plants
  available.  They often deposit a few young and then again take flight.  This highly dispersive nature
  contributes significantly to their effectiveness as vectors of plant viruses. </p>

</blockquote>
<p> The offspring of the dispersants from the overwintering hosts are wingless, and each produce 30 to 80
  young.  The wingless (apterous) aphids are yellowish or greenish in color.  They measure about 1.7 to
  2.0 mm in length.  A medial and lateral green stripes may be present.  The cornicles are moderately
  long, unevenly swollen along their length, and match the body in color.  The appendages are pale.  The
  rate of reproduction is positively correlated with temperature, with the developmental threshold
  estimated to be about 4.3&ordm; C.  As aphid densities increase or plant condition deteriorates, winged forms
  are again produced to aid dispersal.  The nymphs that give rise to winged females (alatae) may be
  pinkish. The dispersants typically produce about 20 offspring, which are always wingless.  This cycle is
  repeated throughout the period of favorable weather.  In Florida, this cycle repeats continuously,
  though in the northern areas of the state the aphid development rate slows greatly during the winter. </p>
<p> In the autumn, in response to change in day length or temperature, winged male and female aphids are
  produced which disperse in search of <i>Prunus</i>.  Timing is important, as foliage on the <i>Prunus</i> hosts is
  physiologically optimal as leaves begin to senesce.  Females arrive first and give birth to wingless
  (apterous) egg-laying forms (oviparae).   Males are attracted to oviparae (egg-producing females) by a
  pheromone, capable of mating with several females, and eggs are produced.  The oviparous female
  deposits four to 13 eggs, usually in crevices in and near buds of <i>Prunus</i> spp.  The oviparous female is
  1.5 to 2.0 mm in length, and pinkish in color. </p>
<p> Parthenogenic reproduction is favored in the many parts of the world where  continuous production of
  crops provides suitable host plants throughout the year, or where weather allows survival on natural
  (noncrop) hosts.  The average temperature necessary for survival of active forms of green peach aphid
  is estimated at 4 to 10&ordm; C.  Plants that readily support aphids through the winter months include beet,
  Brussels sprout, cabbage, kale, potato, and many winter weeds.</p>
<p>Cottier (1953) provides a good description of green peach aphid.  Keys for identification of
  green peach aphid, and many other common aphids, are found in Palmer (1952) and Blackman and
  Eastop (1984).  Stoetzel et al. (1996) published a key for cotton aphids that is also useful for
  distinguishing green peach aphid from most other common vegetable-infesting aphids. </p>
<h3><a name="host" id="host">Host Plants </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p>  Green peach aphid feeds on hundreds of host plants in over 40 plant families; however, it is only the
  viviparous (giving birth to living young) summer stages that feed so widely; the oviparous (egg
  producing) winter stages are much more restrictive in their diet choice.  In temperate latitudes the
  primary or overwintering hosts are trees of the genus <i>Prunus</i>, particularly peach and peach hybrids, but
  also apricot and plum.  During the summer months the aphids abandon their woody hosts for secondary
  or herbaceous hosts, including vegetable crops in the families Solanaceae, Chenopodiaceae,
  Compositae, Brassicaceae, and Cucurbitaceae.  Thus,  it is sometimes known as the peach-potato aphid, reflecting two of its most  common hosts Vegetables that are reported to support green peach
  aphid include artichoke, asparagus, bean, beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrot,
  cauliflower, cantaloupe, celery, corn, cucumber, fennel, kale, kohlrabi, turnip, eggplant, lettuce,
  mustard, okra, parsley, parsnip, pea, pepper, potato, radish, spinach, squash, tomato, turnip,
  watercress, and watermelon.  Field crops such as tobacco, sugar beet, and sunflower also are
  attacked. Numerous flower crops and other ornamental plants are suitable for green peach aphid
  development. Stone fruit crops such as peach are sometimes damaged before the aphids leave for
  summer hosts. Crops differ in their susceptibility to green peach aphid, but it is actively growing plants,
  or the youngest plant tissue, that most often harbors large aphid populations (Heathcote 1962).  In
  warmer climates such as Florida the aphids do not seek out overwintering hosts, but persist as active
  nymphs and adults on hardy crops and weeds throughout the winter months.
</p>
<p> Broadleaf weeds can be very suitable host plants for green peach aphid, thereby creating pest problems
  in nearby crops.  Tamaki (1975), for example, estimated that three to16 million aphids per acre were
  produced on weeds growing on the floor of peach orchards in Washington, and up to one-third of the
  aphids feeding on weed species were carrying beet western yellows virus (BWYV) (Tamaki and Fox
  1982).  Peach trees are not a host of BWYV, so weeds are obviously good reservoirs for plant virus. 
  Common and widespread weeds such as field bindweed, <i>Convolvulus arvensis</i>; lambsquarters, <i>Chenopodium album</i>; and redroot pigweed, <i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i>, are often cited as important
  aphid hosts (Annis et al. 1981). </p>
<h3><a name="damage" id="damage">Damage </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p>  Green peach aphids can attain very high densities on young plant tissue, causing water stress, wilting,
  and reduced growth rate of the plant.  Prolonged aphid infestation can cause appreciable reduction in
  yield of root crops and foliage crops.  Early season infestation is particularly damaging to potato, even if
  the aphids are subsequently removed (Petitt and Smilowitz 1982).  Contamination of harvestable plant
  material with aphids, or with aphid honeydew, also causes loss.  In Arkansas, mild winters allow good
  overwintering survival of green peach aphid on spinach, thereby leading to contamination problems
  (McLeod 1987). Contamination of vegetables by aphids sometimes presents quarantine problems
  (Stewart et al. 1980), and fumigation techniques have been developed that kill the insects without
  causing harm to the vegetables.</p>
<p> The major damage caused by green peach aphid is through transmission of plant viruses.  Indeed, this
  aphid is considered by many to be the most important vector of plant viruses throughout the world. 
  Nymphs and adults are equally capable of virus transmission (Namba and Sylvester 1981), but adults,
  by virtue of being so mobile, probably have greater opportunity for transmission.  Both persistent
  viruses, which move through the feeding secretions of the aphid, and non-persistent viruses, which are
  only temporary contaminants of aphid mouthparts, are effectively transmitted.  Kennedy et al. (1962)
  listed over 100 viruses transmitted by this species.  Some of the particularly damaging diseases include
  potato leafroll virus and potato virus Y to Solanaceae, beet western yellows and beet yellows viruses to
  Chenopodiaceae, lettuce mosaic virus to Compositae, cauliflower mosaic and turnip mosaic viruses to
  Cruciferae, and cucumber mosaic and watermelon mosaic viruses to Cucurbitaceae.  A discoloration in
  potato tubers, called net necrosis, occurs in some potato varieties following transmission of potato
  leafroll. </p>
<h3><a name="natural" id="natural">Natural Enemies </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p>  Hundreds of natural enemies have been recorded, principally <a href="../../beneficial/lady_beetles.htm">lady beetles</a> (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae), lacewings (Neuroptera: mainly Chrysopidae), parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), and entomopathogenic fungi (mainly Entomophthorales).  van Emden et al. (1969) provide a long list of beneficial organisms.  Most are general predators, moving freely among green peach aphid, other aphids, and even other insects.  In some cases the natural enemies are influenced by the host plant, crop cultural practices, and environmental conditions (Tamaki et al. 1981). Weather also reportedly contributes to significant change in aphid numbers, including direct mortality (Beirne 1972), but this also is poorly documented.
</p>
<p> The ephemeral nature of aphid infestation in many crops is believed to prevent the beneficial organisms
  from consistently locating the aphids and reproducing in a timely manner.  Nevertheless, there is a
  strong association between high aphid densities and sudden population decrease following the
  appearance of lady beetles, wasp parasitoids, or entomopathogenic fungi.  For example, green peach
  aphid infesting spring-harvested spinach crops in Arkansas and Oklahoma is suppressed late in the
  growing season by <i>Erynia neoaphidis</i> fungus.  Unfortunately, the disease epizootic often occurs too
  late to keep aphids from attaining high numbers, and fungus-infected aphids remain attached to foliage,
  providing a serious contaminant of spinach foliage (McLeod et al. 1998).  Various studies that
  selectively excluded or killed beneficial organisms have demonstrated the explosive reproductive
  potential of these aphids in the absence of biological control agents, thus demonstrating their value in
  reducing damage potential.  In greenhouse crops, where environmental conditions and predator,
  parasitoid, and pathogen densities can be manipulated, biological suppression is more effective and
  consistent. </p>
<p> Integration of chemicals with natural enemies offers promise for enhanced protection from aphid
  damage.  Shean and Cranshaw (1991) demonstrated that <i>Aphelinus semiflavus</i> Howard
  (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) and <i>Diaeretiella rapae</i> (McIntosh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) differed
  significantly in their relative susceptibility to insecticides, depending on the chemical evaluated.  Also,
  these parasitoids, while in the mummy stage, were less susceptible to insecticide toxicity than was green
  peach aphid.  In general, however, insecticide use in crops is more disruptive to parasitoids than to
  aphids, leading to larger aphid populations.  Sublethal doses of some insecticides also increase aphid
  reproduction (Lowery and Sears 1986).</p>
<p> Despite the beneficial nature of these biotic agents, virus diseases can be effectively transmitted by very
  low aphid densities.  In crops susceptible to aphid-borne virus disease, natural enemies alone are
  probably destined to be relatively ineffective in preventing damage. </p>
<h3><a name="management" id="management">Management </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p> <b>Sampling.</b> Day-degree models using a developmental threshold of 4&deg;C can be used to predict various
  phenological events such as egg hatch and immigration of alate aphids.  Yellow traps, particularly water
  pan traps, are commonly used for population monitoring.  Sequential sampling plans for green peach
  aphid on potato were developed by Hollingsworth and Gatsonis (1990).  Sampling of aphid natural
  enemies in this crop was studied by Mack and Smilowitz (1980). </p>
<p> <b>Insecticides.</b> Despite the numerous options potentially available, many  producers are dependent on
  insecticides for suppression of green peach aphid abundance.  Systemic insecticide applications are
  especially popular at planting time, most of which provide long-lasting protection against aphid
  population buildup during the critical and susceptible early stages of plant growth (Powell 1980) and
  some of which provide protection for 3 months (Palumbo and Kerns 1994). </p>
<p> Green peach aphid is often a pest of cold-weather crops such as spinach.  Aphids are inherently
  difficult to kill with contact insecticides because they are often under the leaves or on new, sheltered
  growth.  Cold weather (less than about 20&deg;C) exacerbates the problem because there is less
  volatilization (fumigation) by the insecticide (Wolfenbarger 1972).  Even systemic insecticides, which
  will kill aphids feeding under the leaf when the insecticide is applied to the upper surface, are much less
  effective at cool temperatures (McLeod 1991). </p>
<p> Excessive and unnecessary use of insecticides should be avoided.  Early in the season, aphid
  infestations are often spotty, and if such plants or areas are treated in a timely manner, great damage
  can be prevented later in the season.  In some cases, use of insecticides for other, more damaging
  insects sometimes leads to outbreaks of green peach aphid.  Inadvertent destruction of beneficial
  insects is purported to explain this phenomenon, but aphid resistance to some types of insecticide may
  also be involved.</p>
<p> Green peach aphids will transmit viruses to crops that they do not colonize.  Insecticides have little
  effect on virus transmission by non-colonizing, transient aphids, though insecticides can prevent
  secondary transmission within crops where colonization occurs. </p>
<p> <b>Biological control.</b> Mackauer (1968) noted that because green peach aphid was able to develop at
  lower temperatures than its parasitoids, the wasps were very beneficial only in benign climates or where
  temperature could be controlled, as in some greenhouses.  Indeed, there has been considerable success
  using parasitoids, the entomopathogenic fungus <i>Verticillium lecanii</i>, and the predatory midge <i>Aphidoletes aphidimyza</i> (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) for greenhouse-grown vegetables, especially in
  Europe (Gilkeson and Hill 1987, Milner and Lutton 1986). </p>
<p> In the field, biological control agents may be differentially affected by the cropping system.  For
  example, Tamaki et al. (1981) found that the wasp <i>Diaeretiella rapae</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)
  was more effective in broccoli, whereas <a href="../../beneficial/lady_beetles.htm">lady beetles</a> (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and <a href="../../beneficial/bigeyed_bugs.htm">bigeyed bug</a> (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) predators were more effective on radish.</p>
<p> Cultural manipulations may benefit predators and parasitoids.  In Washington, bands placed around the
  trunks of peach trees provided good harborage for predators that may suppress the aphids in the
  spring, thereby reducing the number dispersing to vegetables (Tamaki and Halfhill 1968).   In
  California, a brown lacewing (Neuroptera: Hemerobiidae) consistently reduces green peach aphid
  populations in asparagus, but benefits from application of supplemental food sprays (Neuenschwander
  and Hagen 1980).  In New Zealand, pollen levels were supplemented by interplanting flowering plants
  with cabbage, increasing predation of aphids by flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) (White et al. 1995). </p>
<p> <b>Cultural practices.</b> The overwintering behavior of green peach aphid, which in many areas is
  restricted to <em>Prunus</em> or other relatively restricted sites, has fostered research on techniques to reduce
  aphid abundance and disease transmission to vegetables, by either removing the overwintering site or
  by eliminating the aphids before they disperse to vegetables.  Destruction of peach and apricot trees
  (often found in association with houses), and treatment of trees with dormant oil and insecticide, have
  been used in western states to disrupt aphid population increase and disease transmission (Powell and
  Mondor 1976).  Similarly, vegetable and flower plants grown in greenhouses during the winter months
  have been shown to be an excellent source of infestation during the following spring (Bishop and
  Guthrie 1964), and incidence of leafroll in potatoes grown in Idaho is directly related to the abundance
  of aphids in home gardens.  In Colorado, inspection of garden centers and treatment of seedlings found
  infested with aphids are important elements of the overall potato leafroll reduction effort.  As is usually
  the case with aphids, green peach aphid populations tend to be higher when plants are fertilized liberally
  with nitrogen fertilizers (Jansson and Smilowitz 1986). </p>
<p> The wide host range of green peach aphid makes crop rotation a difficult tactic to implement
  successfully.  Also, crops grown down-wind from infested fields are especially susceptible because
  aphids are weak fliers and tend to be blown about.  Infested crops should be destroyed immediately
  after harvest to prevent excessive dispersal, and it may be possible to destroy overwintering hosts if
  they are weeds.  If continuous cropping is implicated in retention of aphid populations then a crop-free
  period is needed.  Row covers can be used to inhibit development of aphid populations.</p>
<p> <b>Disease transmission.</b> Because some of the virus diseases transmitted by green peach aphid are
  persistent viruses, which typically require considerable time for acquisition and transmission, insecticides
  can be effective in preventing disease spread in some crops.  Research in Minnesota (Flanders et al.
  1991) showed that potato leafroll virus was transmitted within the potato crop principally by wingless
  aphids moving from plant to plant.  Infected seed potatoes are the principal source of leafroll in most
  potato crops, so planting disease-free seed is obviously an important step in minimizing the incidence of
  the disease.  Growers commonly inspect fields for signs of disease, and remove and destroy infected
  and nearby plants, a process called &quot;roguing.&quot;  This procedure reduces the ability of aphids to spread
  disease from plant to plant.  Insecticides may not keep winged aphids from alighting in a crop and
  quickly transmitting nonpersistent virus, but they can certainly prevent the secondary spread of virus
  within a crop by colonizing aphids.  As is the case with other aphids, however, insecticide resistance is
  a severe problem in many areas.  Application of mineral oil (Ferro et al. 1980, Lowery et al. 1990) and
  use of aluminum or white plastic mulch (Wyman et al. 1979) reduce virus transmission.  Aphids that are
  not effectively repelled by reflective mulch seem to thrive on mulched crops (Zalom 1981) and exhibit
  high rates of reproduction.  Therefore, even in mulched crops some aphid control is necessary. </p>
<p> Transmission of nonpersistent viruses such as cucumber mosaic virus can sometimes be reduced by
  coating the foliage with vegetable or mineral oil.  Oil is postulated to inhibit virus acquisition and
  transmission by preventing virus attachment to the aphid's mouthparts, or to reduce probing behavior
  (Loebenstein and Raccah 1980).  Oil seems to be most effective when the amount of disease in an area
  that is available to be transmitted to a crop is at a low level.  When disease inoculum or aphid densities
  are at high levels, oils may be inadequate protection (Umesh et al. 1995).  Also, some plants may be
  damaged by oil applications, especially during hot weather (Marco 1993). </p>
<p> Green peach aphid is quite responsive to alarm pheromone, which is normally produced when aphids
  are disturbed (Phelan et al. 1976).  Application of alarm pheromone has shown the potential to disrupt
  virus transmission (Gibson et al. 1984), but this has yet to become an operational technology.  A sex
  pheromone is also known from this aphid, but it functions only at short distances, and has not yet
  proved to be useful in aphid management (Dawson et al. 1990). </p>

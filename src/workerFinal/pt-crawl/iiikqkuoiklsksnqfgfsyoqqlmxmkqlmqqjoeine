/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: A paper read at the 
          500th meeting of the Cambridge Natural Science Club on 12 March 1894, 
          and printed in the 26 April 1894 issue of the journal <u>Nature</u>.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 610]]</font> The subject 
          which I now propose to discuss, is the purport and use, and therefore 
          the essential nature, of what are termed zoological regions. This seems 
          necessary because, although such regions have been more or less generally 
          adopted for more than thirty years, there has of late grown up a conception 
          as to their nature and purport which seems to me to be altogether erroneous, 
          and which, if generally adopted, is <font color="990000">[[p. 611]]</font> 
          calculated to lead to confusion, and to minimise, if not to destroy, 
          whatever advantages may be derived from their use. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time has therefore come when this question must 
          be discussed and, if possible, settled, and, in the hope of leading 
          to such a settlement, I propose to point out what seem to me to be the 
          essential characteristics of such regions, considering them to be established 
          for the purpose of facilitating the study of geographical distribution 
          as one phase of the problem of evolution. In order to come at once to 
          the question at issue, I will first summarise the statements or assumptions 
          which seem to me to imply a misconception of the nature and uses of 
          zoological regions. These fall under two heads:--
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) It is asserted that the same regions will not 
          answer to show the distribution of all groups of land animals. Some 
          of the classes, or orders, or sometimes even the families, require us 
          to establish different sets of regions--regions which may differ both 
          as to their number and their limits--in order to represent and study 
          the distribution of such groups.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) As a guide to what constitutes a region, it 
          is laid down that areas which have few peculiarities in the higher groups--such 
          as families, even though of continental extent, rich and varied in genera 
          and species, and having a large number of peculiar types, are not of 
          regional status. The criterion of a region is said to be the exclusive 
          possession of peculiar groups of higher rank than genera; and this without 
          any regard to proportionate area, or to the poverty and monotony of 
          the fauna as a whole.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the first of these assumptions--that the same 
          set of regions will not serve for the study of the distribution of all 
          animals--raises the whole question of the nature and practical utility 
          of zoological regions, and is a proposition which the chief purpose 
          of this article is to disprove: it must therefore be considered in some 
          detail.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place, it implies that the students 
          of any particular group--reptiles, beetles, butterflies, land shells, 
          &amp;c.--should each mark out the globe into regions exhibiting the 
          chief features of the distribution of its families, genera, and species, 
          and that any other division, arrived at by the study of other groups, 
          will be of little or no use to them. But if this is true, it must be 
          carried further; for not only do the various classes and orders of animals 
          differ considerably in their distribution, but many of the tribes and 
          families. To take the case of the mammalia, which, for distributional 
          study, has always been treated as a whole, how different is the distribution 
          of the Edentata from that of the Ungulata. In the former group South 
          America is so rich that it is of more importance than all the rest of 
          the globe, while in the latter it is so poor that even when joined with 
          North America it would hardly equal either of the other continental 
          regions in importance. But if we constructed a set of regions to correspond 
          with the distribution of each of these orders, we should not bring out 
          the facts more clearly than can be done by means of the regions most 
          usually adopted for the whole class, while we should lose the advantage 
          of easy comparison with each other, and with the remaining orders of 
          the class, as well as with other classes of animals. But <i>comparative</i> 
          distribution is the one essential feature of our study, without facilities 
          for which the bare facts are uninstructive and of hardly any scientific 
          value.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This point has been very clearly brought out in 
          the case of birds, in a work specially devoted to the geographical distribution 
          of one family--the plovers. These birds are, as a whole, cosmopolitan, 
          so much so that Mr. Seebohm tells us &quot;they have not even a remote connection&quot; 
          with the usually adopted zoological regions; and he adds: &quot;These birds 
          only recognise three regions--Arctic, Temperate, and Tropical.&quot; Again, 
          after describing the distribution of the chief genera during the breeding 
          season, he says: &quot;The inevitable conclusion is that the Charadriad&aelig; 
          <i>do</i> pay considerable attention to the climatic or isothermal regions, 
          but appear practically to ignore the Sclaterian regions.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These very positive statements would lead a reader 
          to conclude that here, at all events, the regions established by Dr. 
          Sclater for birds as a whole are of no use. Yet we find that in the 
          great work above referred to--the &quot;Geographical Distribution of the 
          Charadriad&aelig;&quot;--Mr. Seebohm rarely uses these three climatal regions, 
          but throughout the book gives the distribution of the species of each 
          genus in terms of the six Sclaterian regions. And if we consider the 
          habits of these birds, so many of which get their food on sea-shores 
          and tidal estuaries, while all of them have great powers of flight, 
          and many of them migrate along the coasts of all the continents, it 
          is really surprising to find so many of the genera and species which 
          are nevertheless strictly limited to certain of the Sclaterian regions. 
          Owing, no doubt, to the peculiarities of habit just referred to, about 
          half the genera are cosmopolitan, being found in all the six regions 
          during some part of the year; but, even of these, certain groups of 
          species are often confined to one or two regions.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we turn to the non-cosmopolitan genera, however, 
          we find some very instructive facts, which well serve to illustrate 
          my main contention as to the sufficiency of one set of regions. The 
          following table gives the distribution of these genera, taken from Mr. 
          Seebohm's volume:--
        </p><blockquote> <font size="-1">&AElig;dicnemus (Stone Curlews): All regions 
          except the Nearctic.<br />
          Lobivanellus (Wattled Lapwings): All regions except the 
          Nearctic and Neotropical.<br />
          Vanellus (Lapwings): All regions except the Nearctic and Australian.<br />
          Cursorius (Coursers): Pal&aelig;arctic, Oriental, and Ethiopian regions.<br />
          Glareola (Pratincoles): All regions except the Nearctic and Neotropical.<br />
          Ibidorhynchus (Ibis-billed Oyster-catcher): Pal&aelig;arctic only.<br />
          Phalaropus (Phalaropes): Pal&aelig;arctic and Nearctic, migrating or 
          straggling into most of the other regions.<br />
          Limosa (Godwits): All regions except the Ethiopian.<br />
          Ereunetes (Snipe-billed Sandpipers): Pal&aelig;arctic and Nearctic.<br />
          Phegornis (Short-winged Sandpipers): Australian and Neotropical.<br />
          Rhynch&aelig;a (Painted Snipes): The four Tropical regions.<br /></font>
        </blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we have here to notice two points: 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) That in most of these genera not only are they 
          absent from one or more of the Sclaterian regions and present in others, 
          but in the regions where they do occur they are usually widely dispersed, 
          thus showing that their range is defined and limited by the very same 
          barriers which so well mark out the general range of land birds.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) We also find that the use of the old-established 
          and widely accepted six regions of Dr. Sclater, enables us very clearly 
          and concisely to describe or to tabulate the comparative distribution 
          of the genera and species of this great family of wading birds, which 
          have been thought to be such erratic wanderers that the author of a 
          work devoted to them declares that--&quot;the zoological regions of Sclater 
          have nothing whatever to do&quot; with them.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this case of the plovers is perhaps as strong 
          as any that can be brought to prove that different groups require different 
          sets of regions; and it at once brings us to the question at issue, 
          which is, whether anything would be gained by establishing a set of 
          Charadriine regions. The climatic regions--which Mr. Seebohm suggests 
          as more natural in this case--would not bring out such facts as the 
          absence of &AElig;dicnemus from the Nearctic and of Limosa from the 
          Ethiopian regions; the limitation of Glareola to the eastern hemisphere, 
          and of Phegornis to the Australian and Neotropical regions, unless the 
          Sclaterian regions were also used as sub-regions--thus introducing complication 
          in place of simplicity, and gaining, so far as I can see, no advantage 
          whatever.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But further, if the plovers are to have their own 
          regions and sub-regions, there are probably 50 or 100 of the orders 
          and families of the animal kingdom which would equally require to be 
          so treated; and as in all these cases the new regions must have separate 
          names, it is quite clear that by far the larger part of them would remain 
          for ever unknown, except to their inventors.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little consideration will, I think, convince us 
          that this plan, of practically unlimited distinct sets of regions, would 
          be a positive hindrance to any intelligent study of the distribution 
          of animals, a study which derives its chief interest and importance 
          from its relation to the theory of organic evolution, and which must 
          therefore include the <i>comparative distribution</i> of the various 
          classes, orders, and minor groups. But how will it be possible to make 
          the necessary comparison if the distribution of the groups to be compared 
          is given in terms of as many distinct <font color="990000">[[p. 612]]</font> 
          sets of regions all differing in their names and in their boundaries? 
          It would be like comparing the structures of different animals as described 
          in the works of a number of anatomists each of whom had a different 
          classification and a different set of technical terms, so that before 
          a single comparison could be made the terms used in one description 
          would have to be translated into the terms used in the other. In the 
          study of geographical distribution, should this system prevail, the 
          student would find it necessary to adopt some one set of regions for 
          his own use, and then endeavour to translate the facts given by each 
          specialist into terms of that set before he could obtain any clear conception 
          or accurate knowledge of their comparative distribution. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An idea seems to be prevalent among biologists that 
          there is some <i>law</i> of distribution, that may differ for different 
          groups, and that may require different regions to exhibit it or to conform 
          to it. This, however, is a mere supposition; but, if it is a correct 
          one, we shall certainly not be likely to discover the &quot;law&quot; by recording 
          the facts of distribution in such a way as to render a<i> comparative</i> 
          study of them as difficult as possible. Laws of distribution can only 
          be arrived at by comparative study of the different groups of animals, 
          and for this study we require a common system of regions and a common 
          nomenclature.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears to me, however, that the &quot;law,&quot; or at 
          all events the general principles on which the diversities of distribution 
          among land animals depend, is already fairly well understood. What we 
          require is to be able to work out the details in the different groups, 
          and thus explain certain difficulties or anomalies. To detect anomalies 
          it is essential to compare the distribution of the different groups 
          by means of a common system of regions. If we construct regions to fit 
          each group, the student of each separate group will be apt to forget 
          that it presents any anomalies which require explanation.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving this part of the subject it may be 
          well to give a short account of the reasons which led to the original 
          establishment of the six Sclaterian regions for the purpose of facilitating 
          the study of the geographical distribution of animals; in order to show 
          that they are not arbitrary divisions, but are founded on a large body 
          of observations. It is evident, in the first place, that many of the 
          ordinary divisions of the geographer serve well to define the areas 
          characterised by special groups of animals or plants. The South European, 
          the Malayan, the Brazilian, or the South African faunas and floras, 
          are constantly referred to, because those districts are really characterised 
          by distinct assemblages of animals and plants, and this undoubtedly 
          depends partly on their possessing peculiarities of climate resulting 
          in peculiarities of vegetation--as forest, prairie, desert, or woodland; 
          partly in their being limited by more or less effective barriers, climatic 
          or geographical; and partly on their past geological history and on 
          the more recent changes of physical geography they have undergone. But 
          such areas as these are too small and too numerous to enable us to express 
          the broader features of the distribution of animals, and the larger 
          or primary geographical divisions--which were those used by the older 
          naturalists--are often unsuitable and misleading, because they are <i>not</i> 
          coincident in their boundaries with those more permanent natural barriers 
          which have mainly determined the zoological specialities of different 
          parts of the globe. Yet some of the divisions of the geographer are 
          such well-defined and ancient areas that they <i>do</i> nearly coincide 
          with characteristic assemblages of animals; and thus the geographical 
          units, Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, South America, and Australia, 
          can be easily modified into six zoological regions, which do represent 
          with considerable accuracy the broad features of animal distribution. 
          These modifications may be briefly enumerated in order to show how the 
          limits of the regions have been arrived at.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning with Europe, we see at once that it is 
          zoologically homogeneous, since a large proportion of the species and 
          all the larger genera range over the whole of it. But the same genera, 
          in the case of the higher animals, at all events, prevail in North Africa, 
          mingled only with a few desert types, and we therefore, for zoological 
          purposes, add this area to Europe. It is interesting to note that we 
          have a clear explanation of this identity, in the proofs that quite 
          recently--that is, during the Pleistocene period--Europe and North Africa 
          were connected both at Gibraltar, and from Sicily and Malta to Tripoli, 
          as indicated both by submarine banks which still unite them, and by 
          the fossil hippopotami and elephants of the Maltese, Sicilian, and Gibraltan 
          caverns. But further, if we go eastward from Europe into Siberia and 
          Central Asia, we find the same genera and many of the same species of 
          mammals and birds ranging all the way to the shores of the Pacific. 
          To such an extent is this the case that about fifty-six species of British 
          passerine birds range to Central and North-East Asia, while no less 
          than fifty-three species (or representative sub-species) of land-birds 
          are common to Great Britain and Japan. Europe and North Asia are therefore 
          parts of one zoological region, the reason being that there is not, 
          nor has been in recent geological times, any effective barrier between 
          them, while in climate they are sufficiently alike.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, then, we have roughly marked out our first 
          great zoological region--the Pal&aelig;arctic, or northern old-world 
          region. Southward its limits are undefined, and where there are no well-marked 
          barriers, such as the Himalayas or the desert, there will always be 
          a greater or less width of border-land between two conterminous regions.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this Pal&aelig;arctic region is, fortunately, 
          the only one that differs very largely from the ordinary geographical 
          quarters or divisions of the globe. For when we go to Africa we find 
          that, leaving out the northern portion, which we have seen to be essentially 
          European, the remainder constitutes a very distinct and compact area 
          zoologically--the land of giraffes, zebras, hippopotami, baboons, and 
          antelopes--which has been termed the Ethiopian region. Then we have 
          southern or tropical Asia, together with the larger Malay Islands, which 
          we know must recently have formed a part of it, constituting the Indian 
          or Oriental region, and corresponding almost exactly with tropical Asia. 
          Then we come to Australia, which forms the nucleus of another well-marked 
          region, including with it, however, most of the Pacific Islands, with 
          New Guinea and the Moluccas. Turning now to the western hemisphere, 
          we have South America and North America, which, with slight modifications, 
          form two well-defined regions--the Neotropical, including all South 
          America with the tropical portion of North America and the West Indian 
          Islands; the Nearctic, comprising the remainder of North America.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I do not think that any one has denied that 
          these are truly natural divisions of the earth from a broad zoological 
          point of view. The controversy respecting them has turned wholly on 
          whether they are of equal rank. This point, however, will be referred 
          to later on. We are now dealing with the question of the need of other 
          modes of dividing the earth's surface in order to exhibit and to study 
          the distribution of certain groups of animals. I have already urged 
          that to do so would defeat the very object aimed at, and render the 
          study of geographical distribution very much more difficult. I have 
          shown how readily the Sclaterian regions enable us to describe or tabulate 
          the distribution even of a group which has been said to &quot;pay no attention 
          to them whatever&quot;; and I have now just pointed out that these six regions 
          are, admittedly, natural, which can only be because during the more 
          recent geological periods they have formed single more or less continuous 
          areas, while separated either by geographical, climatal, or biological 
          barriers from the adjacent areas.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the only real interest of the study of geographical 
          distribution lies in its giving us a clue to the causes which have brought 
          about the very divergent and often conflicting distribution of the various 
          species, genera and higher groups, and by thus being able to explain 
          most of the anomalies of distribution. These causes we can trace, in 
          many cases, either to geographical or climatal changes in the past, 
          which temporarily removed the barriers that now exist or interposed 
          others that are now absent; or, on the other hand, to the recent extinction 
          of groups in certain regions where they formerly abounded; or, again, 
          to the very different powers of dispersal possessed by different organisms, 
          which enable some groups to spread easily where others are stopped by 
          an insurmountable barrier. Now it is usually this last phenomenon, of 
          varying powers of dispersal, that has led the students of certain groups 
          to urge that the old-established regions do not serve their purpose. 
          But when a group can more or less easily traverse the barrier between 
          two regions, however permanent that barrier may be, the fact enables 
          us to explain the exceptional distribution of that group, but it does 
          not render the established regions less natural, or require a fresh 
          set of regions, which would certainly not be natural in any broad sense, 
          to explain them.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, it will usually, perhaps always, be found 
          that even in the groups appealed to as requiring a new set of regions, 
          a portion of the species, and even of the genera, are limited to the 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 613]]</font> older regions. I have already 
          shown that this is the case with the almost cosmopolitan plovers, and 
          it also occurs in another instance where it has been very strongly urged 
          that the Sclaterian regions will not apply. I allude to the distribution 
          of insects in the Oriental and Australian portions of the Malay Archipelago. 
          Here, in the case of birds and mammals, there is a most abrupt and striking 
          change on passing from Borneo and Java to the Moluccas and New Guinea; 
          but in insects this is not conspicuously the case, and it has been said 
          that the whole Archipelago, from Sumatra to New Guinea, and even to 
          the Solomon Islands, is characterised by one uniform insect-fauna. This, 
          however, is by no means a correct statement. There are undoubtedly many 
          genera common to the whole Archipelago, as might be expected from the 
          great similarity of climate and the uniformly forest-clad nature of 
          the islands, together with the power of crossing narrow seas possessed 
          by all winged insects. Yet, both among butterflies and beetles, especially 
          the latter, there are a considerable number of genera confined respectively 
          to the Indo-Malayan and Austro-Malayan divisions of the Archipelago, 
          giving to the fauna of each a characteristic facies. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if we adopt for insects, as has been proposed, 
          a single Malayan region including the whole of the Archipelago, we should 
          be apt to lose sight of the two distinct elements it contains, the one 
          due to an ancestral diversity corresponding to that which still exists 
          in all the higher animals, the other dependent on a comparatively recent 
          process of intermigration between the two portions of what are fundamentally 
          distinct insect faunas; while it is not clear what corresponding advantage 
          would be obtained by the student of geographical distribution.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the point of view I have now endeavoured to 
          set forth, we may, I think, draw the conclusion that the six Sclaterian 
          regions are natural zoological divisions, because they are separated 
          by barriers of considerable antiquity and permanence, which have led 
          to their being characterised each by well-marked assemblages of the 
          higher animals. Further, when groups of organisms which from their exceptional 
          powers of dispersal, or from any other cause, have been able to extend 
          themselves beyond these barriers, that is no reason whatever for establishing 
          new regions--which would <i>not</i> be marked out by equally important 
          barriers--since the divergencies in the distribution of the various 
          classes or orders, as exhibited by means of a common series of regions, 
          is one of those interesting problems of distribution which can only 
          be solved by comparative study. Not only, therefore, is one set of regions 
          all that is required to exhibit the distribution of the various terrestrial 
          organisms; but, for all purposes of comparative study it is immeasurably 
          superior to the establishment of numerous sets of special regions, constructed 
          so as to accord with the distribution of special animal groups.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now come to the second objection--the supposed 
          inequality of the six Sclaterian regions. Some of them are said to be 
          really only sub-regions, while others are said to be so diverse as to 
          be rendered more equal if divided into two regions.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This question of equality is decided almost exclusively 
          by one characteristic, and one that seems to me to be not the most important 
          for the purpose we have in view. This character is the possession of 
          peculiar groups of the rank of family or order, taking no account either 
          of the richness and variety of life-development, or of the geographical 
          extent of the area in question. From this point of view Australia is 
          sometimes said to be equal to all the rest of the world, both on account 
          of its rich development of the marsupial order, but especially because 
          in the duck-bill and spiny ant-eater it possesses a distinct sub-class 
          of mammals. From another point of view, however, Australia, Africa, 
          and South America are united in one primary region, because they alone 
          possess one of the sub-classes of birds--the Ratit&aelig;.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Zealand and Madagascar have each been proposed 
          as regions, the first on account of its Apteryx and moas, with its isolated 
          lizard-like Hatteria;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> the second for its peculiar 
          families of Lemurs and Insectivora, and equally peculiar families and 
          genera of birds. In contrast with these, we have the proposal to unite 
          the rich and extensive Pal&aelig;arctic and Nearctic regions to form 
          one region only, because they do not possess a sufficient number of 
          peculiar families and genera of mammals and birds, although the new 
          region thus constituted is perhaps twenty times as rich as New Zealand 
          in varied forms of life. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who adopt these views appear to me to attach 
          a very exaggerated importance to the possession by a limited area of 
          some remnant of an otherwise extinct group, which has been preserved 
          owing to its long-continued isolation in a district where it has been 
          secure from the competition of higher forms--almost always, therefore, 
          in an island. Such survivals are exceedingly interesting; but I cannot 
          see what they have to do with the division of the whole land-area of 
          the globe into zoological regions, whose sole purport and use is to 
          facilitate the study of the geographical distribution of all land animals.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conception of zoological regions expressed in 
          the views I am now combating seems to me to be altogether erroneous, 
          and to lead to results which are neither useful nor instructive, and 
          far less natural than that which takes account of a variety of characters 
          as the best guides to an approximate equality. I urge, therefore, that 
          zoological regions, to be at once natural and useful in the highest 
          degree, must be founded on a combination of essential features, as follows:--
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) They should be founded upon, and approximate 
          to, the great primary geographical divisions of the earth, which there 
          is reason to believe have been permanent during considerable geological 
          periods.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) They should be rich and varied in <i>all</i> 
          the main types of animal life.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) They should possess great individuality; whether 
          exhibited by the <i>possession</i> of numerous peculiar species, genera, 
          or families, or by the entire <i>absence</i> of genera or families which 
          are abundant and widespread in some of the adjacent regions.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tested by these conditions the six Sclaterian regions 
          seem all that can be desired--subject of course to modification in details. 
          If we make some allowance for the inevitable poverty of the temperate 
          as compared with the tropical regions--due both to present and to past 
          conditions of climate--they present a greater amount of equality than 
          might be expected. The Neotropical region is somewhat the richest--very 
          much the richest in birds and insects--and this may be traced to its 
          possessing so enormous an area of tropical forest-clad land, together 
          with the greatest of the mountain ranges situated wholly within the 
          tropics--the Andes, and two other isolated mountain groups of great 
          extent and antiquity in Brazil and Guiana; while the Nearctic is the 
          poorest--due perhaps to its rather limited area, its large extent of 
          arid lands, but more especially to its extreme climate, a severe winter 
          prevailing to considerably south of the parallel of 40&deg; N. Latitude.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subdivisions of the primary regions is far less 
          important; and with the same facts before them, naturalists arrive at 
          different conclusions. I would suggest, therefore, that for the present, 
          at all events, no definite named subdivisions should be attempted, but 
          that the continental portion of each region be subdivided by the use 
          of the terms north, south, east, west, and central, with their combinations 
          where required. By the use of these terms the range of a genus or species 
          within the regions may be defined with sufficient accuracy, and in a 
          manner at once intelligible to every student.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conclusions to which this discussion has led 
          us may now be briefly summarised as follows: Zoological regions are 
          those primary divisions of the earth's surface of approximately continental 
          extent, which are characterised by distinct assemblages of animal types. 
          Though strictly natural, in the sense already pointed out, they have 
          no absolute character as equal independent existences, since they may 
          have been different in past ages, but are more or less conventional, 
          being established solely for the purpose of facilitating the study of 
          the existing geographical distribution of animals in its bearing on 
          the theory of evolution. There is thus, in my opinion, no question of 
          who is<i> right</i> and who is <i>wrong</i> in the naming and grouping 
          of these regions, or of determining what are the<i> true</i> primary 
          regions. All proposed regions are, from some points of view, natural, 
          but the whole question of their grouping and nomenclature is one of 
          convenience and of utility in relation to the object aimed at.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is because I think that the future progress of 
          a branch of biological study in which I take great interest will depend 
          on our arriving at some uniformity of view as to this question of zoological 
          regions, that I have devoted so much space to its discussion.</p>

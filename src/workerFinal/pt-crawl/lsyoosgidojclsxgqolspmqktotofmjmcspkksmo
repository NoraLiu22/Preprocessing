<tr><td bgcolor="#ffffcc">Students learn how to investigate the
<strong>olfactory system</strong> and then find out how to plan and carry
out their own experiments. In the "CLASS EXPERIMENT," students find that
the ability to detect an odor decreases with continued exposure to that
odor, a property called <strong>olfactory fatigue</strong>.  They learn
basic facts about sensory receptors, nerve connections, and brain areas,
and discover what conditions can affect olfactory fatigue.<p>

In "TRY YOUR OWN EXPERIMENT," students design experiments to further
explore the sense of smell.  For example, they can investigate whether
mixing two substances makes it harder to identify odors; whether gender
affects the ability to identify odors, and whether people vary in their
ability to match unlabeled containers of odor materials.

BACKGROUND CONCEPTS</A></h2></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffcc">

<font size="+1">1. <I><strong> Overview of the
smell and taste systems</strong></I></font><p>
<blockquote><strong>Odor and food molecules activate membrane
receptors</strong></blockquote><p>

Sensations from our noses and mouths alert us to pleasure, danger, food
and drink in the environment.  The complicated processes of smelling and
tasting begin when molecules detach from substances and float into noses
or are put into mouths.  In both cases, the molecules must dissolve in
watery mucous in order to bind to and stimulate special receptor cells.
These cells transmit messages to brain areas where we perceive odors and
tastes, and where we remember people, places, or events associated with
these olfactory (smell) and gustatory (taste) sensations.
<P>
The neural systems for these two chemical senses can distinguish thousands
of different odors and flavors. Identification begins at membrane
receptors on sensory cells, where odorant or taste molecules fit into
molecular slots or pockets with the right "lock and key" fit.  This
latching together of <strong>ligand</strong> and membrane receptor leads
to the production
of an electrical signal, which speeds along a pathway formed by
<strong>nerve
cells (neurons)</strong> and their extensions called
<strong>axons</strong>. In this way,
information reaches brain areas that perceive and interpret the stimulus.  
<P>

<blockquote><strong>A membrane receptor will respond to several
structurally related molecules</strong></blockquote><p>

The activation of receptors by discrete chemical structures is apparently
not absolute, for a given membrane receptor will respond to a group of
structurally similar compounds.  Probably hundreds of odor membrane
receptors exist, but many fewer taste receptors, perhaps on the order of
10 or 20 (we only know of about five now).  The fact that we can
discriminate thousands of smells and tastes is a result of complex
substances activating different combinations of odor and taste receptors.
Researchers frequently test people or animals with pure chemicals in order
to find the best stimulus for a receptor, but in the real world odors and
foods consist of many different types of molecules.<p>

<blockquote><strong>The neural systems for taste and smell share several
characteristics</strong></blockquote><p>

Although the neural systems for taste and smell are distinct from one
another, the sensations of flavors and aromas often work together,
especially during eating.  Much of what we normally describe as flavor
comes from food molecules wafting up our noses. Further, these two senses
both have connections to brain areas that control emotions, regulate
food and water intake, and form certain types of memories.<p>

Another similarity between these systems is the constant turnover of
olfactory and gustatory receptor cells. After about ten days, taste
receptor cells die and are replaced by cells that differentiate from a
sort of stem cell in the taste bud. More surprising is the story of
olfactory sensory cells.  These are not epithelial cells as are taste
cells, but neurons, which until recently were not known to be generated in
adults.  (Recent evidence shows that this can happen, even <a href =
"neurogen.html">in the brain</A>). The olfactory sensory neurons are not
only replaced every 60 days or so, but each must also grow an axon to the
correct place in the brain. Researchers are investigating how taste
perception and odor recognition are maintained in the face of this
turnover and new axon growth.</td></tr></table><p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffcc" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 border=0><tr><td

<I><strong>Odor receptors are ciliated sensory neurons in the upper nasal
cavity</strong></I></font><p>

Humans can detect on the order of 10,000 "odorants," or substances that
stimulate the sense of smell, and can detect some of these at
concentrations as low as a few parts per trillion. Special olfactory
receptor cells, about fifty million of them, line the upper reaches of the
nasal cavity in a sheet of <strong>olfactory epithelium</strong>.
Hair-like cilia dangle from the ends of the cells into the mucous layer
covering the epithelium, where odor molecules bind to membrane receptors
on the cilia.

<p> What is the mechanism for distinguishing aromas?  As mentioned in
Section 1, membrane receptors contain molecular pockets that accommodate
only compounds with certain chemical structures.  When an odorant molecule
binds to a receptor, an intracellular "second messenger" system (usually
using cyclic AMP) is engaged.  After several steps, the membrane of the
nerve cell propagates an electrical signal along its length and passes it
on to the next nerve cell in the pathway. The second messenger system is a
signaling mechanism used in many sensory nerve cells as well as in other
cells in the body.<p>

All vertebrate olfactory receptor neurons examined so far are
"generalists."  In other words, they respond best to one class of
substances, more weakly to another group or two, and not at all to others.
Insects and some other animals possess odor "specialists" that respond
only to one pure substance, that is, a single molecule.  Usually this is a
pheromone that is employed in finding a mate.  Researchers expect to find
specialist cells in vertebrates as well;  these are difficult to find
because there probably aren't many of them, and scientists haven't yet
identified their specific ligands.<p>

<font size="+1">3. <I><strong>Olfactory signals go
to two types of areas in the brain</strong></I></font><p>
</td></tr></table> 

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bgcolor="#ffffcc"><tr>
<td><img src = "./gif/olf11.gif" align=left hspace=20>Where do odor
messages go once they activate the sensory neurons in the nasal cavity?  
To get to the brain, the axons of the olfactory sensory neurons must get
through the skull (see side view of the skull in Figure 1 on the
left).<img src = "./gif/chembase.gif" width=209 height=135 align=right
hspace=20 vspace=10>

The olfactory epithelium lines the bone of the part of the skull just
above the nasal passages, and the axons of the neurons pass directly
through tiny holes in this bone.  Here they enter the first relay station,
the olfactory bulbs, one on either side of the bottom surface of the brain
(Figure 2, right).  The electrical signal generated when an olfactory
sensory neuron is activated is passed along to a secondary neuron residing
in the bulb, and from here the signal goes by way of the olfactory tract
to other brain areas. <p>

The olfactory system is often described as the most "primitive" sensory
system because of its early phylogenetic development and its connections
to older, subconscious portions of the brain.  From the olfactory bulbs,
odor messages go to several brain structures that make up the "olfactory
cortex," an area that evolved before the cortical areas that give us
consciousness.  This part of the cortex is on the bottom surface of       
the brain, with some of the olfactory areas folded under the visible
parts.  These areas have connections to the limbic system (including the
hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus), which is
important in emotional states and in memory formation (see Figure 3).
Thus, a smell
frequently activates intense feelings and memories before a person even
identifies the odor.
<p>
Messages also go to conscious cortical areas. After a relay in the
olfactory cortex , signals enter a way station called the thalamus, and
then travel on to the frontal cortex, where identification and other
related thought processes take place. 
<p>
Thus, odor messages go to primitive brain areas where they influence
emotions and memories, and to "higher" areas where they modify conscious
thought (Fig. 3, below).<p>

<I><strong>Odors map onto specific brain
areas</strong></I></font><p>

Because sight, sound, and touch sensations map in a spatial way onto brain
areas, researchers wondered if this happens with odors.  They have found
that in the olfactory bulb, neurons, their cytoplasmic processes, and
support cells are not evenly distributed but form clumps called glomeruli.
Certain odorants activate only one or a small number of glomeruli,
producing a kind of mapping, although it is not a spatial map of the
location of odors in relation to the body, but a functional map of odor
types.  Whether this mapping is continued at higher brain levels is
uncertain.  A type of spatial mapping also exists in the olfactory
epithelium, in the nasal passages.  Here, scientists have shown that
certain
volatile chemicals attach to receptor cells in defined patches of
epithelium and not to others. <p>

<font size="+1">5. <I><strong>Patterns of neural activity allow
us to identify odors
</strong></I></font><p>

To summarize the process of odor detection, let's follow an odorant into
the nose.  At 7 a.m., molecules from a cup of coffee float into the air
and drift into your nose.  You breathe deeply, drawing the molecules up
into the top of your nasal passages.  Several types of molecules are
present, and each fits into a slot on a membrane receptor that can
accommodate only that class of molecular structures. 
<p>
As soon as the molecules stick to their receptors, intracellular systems
of enzymes and substrates go into gear, quickly causing each cell to
produce an electrical signal.  The signal flashes through the axon of each
olfactory sensory neuron and on to cells in the olfactory bulb. Each type
of receptor neuron sends its signal to a specific clump of cells in the
olfactory bulb, forming a sort of odor map.
<P>
From here, the message from each bulb cell zips to several places by way
of branches from the cell's axon.  Messages to the olfactory cortex give
you that "aahhh" feeling, others activate memories of previous cups of
coffee, still others wind up stimulating motor areas to cause
salivation.  The signals travel another pathway to your frontal cortex,
which "says" to you:  "COFFEE!"
<p>
The experiences of perceiving and interpreting the coffee odor are the
result of activating a <strong>pattern</strong> of neural components, and
in turn, specific
memories, feelings, and thoughts. <p>

<font size="+1">6. <I><strong>Several mechanisms
may contribute to olfactory fatigue</strong></i></font><p>

<strong>Adaptation, or fatigue</strong>, to constant stimulation is a
general feature of
sensory systems.  For instance, the touch receptor cells in the skin adapt
to the stimulation of our clothes, a fortunate thing, or we would be
distracted by them constantly.  Adaptation involves mechanisms at the
level of the receptor cell, including the inactivation of ion channels in
the membrane that generate the electrical signal.  In a simplified
explanation, after a stimulus causes a receptor cell to produce an
electrical signal, the cell membrane soon stops allowing ions to flow,
thus preventing further signals.  Removal of the stimulus followed by
restimulation activates the process all over again.<p>

Researchers have noted that people adapt to odors, such as the smell of
tobacco smoke in a room, more quickly than the properties of olfactory
receptor cells would predict.  Thus, they believe that olfactory fatigue
involves some types of central nervous system mechanisms as well as
receptor adaptation. Although these brain mechanisms are currently
unknown, scientists speculate that inhibitory circuits in the brain
"quash" the incoming sensory signals from receptors before they reach
conscious levels.<p>

<font size="+1"><strong>7. <I>Genes determine the
kinds of odor receptors that we have, and
experiences shape our perceptions</I></strong></font><p>

Olfactory abilities vary widely among individuals -- we all know someone
who
is able to smell things when no one else can, or someone who doesn't seem
to mind an unpleasant odor when most people do. Studies have shown that
people who are unable to smell one or one class of odors frequently have
small genetic differences from the general population.  The inability to
smell is called "anosmia," and it may be general, or specific for one
odor.  Temporary general anosmia or "hyposmia" (lessened sense of smell)
can result from a cold or certain medicines.  "Hyperosmia," a heightened
sense of smell, can be a genetic trait.
<p>
Previous experiences and our physiological states also affect our
reactions to odors and our perceptions.  The odor of frying trout or hot
cocoa may smell wonderful to a hungry camper, but terrible to someone with
the stomach flu.  A child who remembers her mother sprinkling cinnamon on
her little brother's vomit before cleaning it up may never want cinnamon
cookies again, even as an adult.
<p>
Our expectations and beliefs can even affect measurements such as
olfactory fatigue times.  Studies have shown that the time for adapting to
an odor is significantly different when people believe they
are being exposed to a harmless aroma, compared to when they think they
are smelling a hazardous substance, even when the odor is exactly the
same.<p>     

<font size="+1"><strong>8. <I>Olfactory disorders
may be genetic, or may result from illness or
injury</I></strong></font><p>

While genetic differences account for some cases of anosmia or other
olfactory disorders as mentioned above, most are caused by illnesses or
accidents.  Small growths in the nasal cavities (polyps), dental problems,
hormonal disturbances, or sinus infections, as well as common colds, may
cause chemosensory losses.  Injury to the head may damage nerve fibers or
break axons.  Patients who receive radiation therapy for cancers of the
head or neck often develop changes in their sense of smell.
<p>
Are these disorders serious?  Our sense of smell alerts us to fires,
poisonous fumes, leaking gas, and spoiled food.  It can stop us from
entering a dangerous area or putting something into our mouths that can
make us sick.  Further, such disturbances can be a signal that some other
disease is present, such as Parkinson's disease, hypertension, or
diabetes.  People should see a doctor if they realize something is wrong
with their sense of smell.

PLANNING AND TEACHING LAB ACTIVITIES</a> </h2></td></tr><tr><TD 
bgcolor="#ffffcc">

<font size="+1"><strong><I>Provide background 
information</I></strong></font><p>

First, prepare students for lab activities by giving background 
information according to your teaching practices (e.g., lecture, 
discussion, handouts, models).  Because students have no way of 
discovering sensory receptors or nerve pathways for themselves, they need 
some basic anatomical and physiological information.  Teachers may choose 
the degree of detail and the methods of presenting the olfactory system, 
based on grade level and time available. <P>

<font size="+1"><strong><I>Offer students the 
chance to create their own experiments</I></strong></font><p>

While students do need direction and practice to become good laboratory 
scientists, they also need to learn how to ask and investigate questions 
that they generate themselves.  Science classrooms that offer only guided 
activities with a single "right" answer do not help students learn to 
formulate questions, think critically, and solve problems.  Because 
students are naturally curious, incorporating student investigations into 
the classroom is a logical step after they have some experience with a 
system. <P>

The "Try Your Own Experiment" section of this unit (see the accompanying 
Teacher and Student Guides) offers students an opportunity to direct some 
of their own learning after a control system has been established in the 
"Class Experiment." Because students are personally vested in this type of 
experience, they tend to remember both the science processes and concepts 
from these laboratories. <P>

<font size="+1"><strong><I>Use Explore Time or 
Brainstorming before experimenting</I></strong></font><p>

To encourage student participation in planning and conducting experiments, 
first provide Explore Time or Brainstorming Time. Because of their 
curiosity, students usually "play" with lab materials first even in a more 
traditional lab, so taking advantage of this natural behavior is usually 
successful.
<P>
For some experiments, such as the olfactory lab, brainstorming is probably 
best. In these labs, if students investigate the materials before starting 
the experiments, they will probably identify (or hear others identify) and 
memorize many of them. Further, in activities to stimulate memories 
associated with odors, the "surprise" element of a sudden whiff of 
material is important in generating an interesting experience. Instead of 
letting students explore, the teacher can simply indicate the lab bench, 
saying that the containers of odor materials will be available for 
experiments. When students see that opaque, unmarked containers of 
materials are available, they can begin to generate questions for 
investigations, and the teacher can offer more ideas.<P>

<font size="+1"><strong><I>Class Experiment</I></strong></font><p>

After students gain an interest in the materials and subject, lead the 
class into the Class Experiment and help them to formulate the Lab 
Question. (Using the Teacher Demonstration suggested in the Teacher Guide 
will also help students focus on the subject.) Hand out the Student Guide 
and any worksheets after brainstorming, so students have a chance to think 
on their own. (See the accompanying Guides.)<P>

<font size="+1"><strong><I>"Try Your Own Experiment"</I></strong></font><p>

For the Try Your Own Experiment activity, follow the procedure above, 
adding the new materials for student-generated experiments.  Let the 
students suggest a variety of ideas, then channel their energies to make 
the lab manageable.  For example, when a number of groups come up with 
similar ideas, help them formulate one lab question so that the groups can 
compare data.  The goal is to encourage students to think and plan 
independently while providing sufficient limits to keep the classroom 
focused. The Teacher and Student Guides contain detailed suggestions for 
conducting good student-generated experiments. <P>

By reaching Project 2061 Benchmarks for Science Literacy, students will
also fulfill many of the National Science Education Standards and
individual state standards for understanding the content and applying the
methods of science. Because the Benchmarks most clearly state what is
expected of students, they are used here. Below is a list of Benchmarks
that can be met while teaching the olfactory sense activities. The
Benchmarks are now on-line at:  <a href
= "http://www.project2061.org/tools/benchol/bolframe.htm">
http://www.project2061.org/tools/benchol/bolframe.htm</a><p>

The Benchmarks are listed by chapter, grade level, and item number; for
instance, 1A, 6-8, #1 indicates Chapter 1, section A, grades 6-8,
benchmark 1.<p>

<strong>The process of inquiry used in the olfactory sense
activities will help students reach the following summarized
Benchmarks:</strong><p> <ul>

<li>1A, 6-8, #1: When similar investigations give different results, the
scientific challenge is to judge whether the differences are trivial or
significant, and it often takes further studies to decide.  
<p>
<li>1B, 6-8, #1: Scientific investigations usually involve the collection
of relevant evidence, the use of logical reasoning, and the application of
imagination in devising hypotheses and explanations to make sense of the
collected evidence. 
<P>
<li>1B, 6-8, #2: If more than one variable changes at the same time in an
experiment, the outcome of the experiment may not be clearly attributable
to any one of the variables.  
<P>
<li>12A, 6-8, #2: Know that hypotheses are valuable, even if they turn out
not to be true.  
<P>
<li>12A, 6-8, #3: Know that often, different explanations can be given for
the same evidence, and it is not always possible to tell which one is
correct.  
<P>
<li>12C, 3-5, #3: Keep a notebook that describes observations made,
carefully distinguishes actual observations from ideas and speculations
about what was observed, and is understandable weeks or months later. 
<P>
<li>12D, 6-8, #2:  Read simple tables and graphs and identify the
relationships they reveal.
<P>
<li>12D, 6-8, #3:  Locate information in reference books,  newspapers and
magazines, compact discs and  computer databases.
<P>

<strong>The neuroscience content in the olfactory sense
activities and background
material will help to meet the following benchmarks: </strong>
<P>
<li>5C, 6-8, #1: All living things are composed of cells. Different body
tissues and organs are made up of different kinds of cells. The cells in
similar tissues and organs in other animals are similar to those in human
beings.<P>

<li>5C, 6-8, #2: Cells repeatedly divide to make more cells for growth and
repair.<P>

<li>6A, 6-8, #1: Like other animals, human beings have body systems for
the coordination of body functions.
<P>
<li>6C, 6-8, #1: Organs and organ systems are composed of cells and help
provide all cells with basic needs.
<P>
<li>6D, 6-8, #4: Attending closely to any one input of information usually
reduces the ability to attend to others at the same time. 	
<P>
<li>6D, 6-8, #3: Human beings can detect a tremendous range of visual and
olfactory stimuli.

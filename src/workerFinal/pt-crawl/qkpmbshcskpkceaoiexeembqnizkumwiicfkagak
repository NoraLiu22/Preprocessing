					<h3 class="line">Howâ€™s Life?</h3>
					<p align="left">Ireland performs well in many dimensions of well-being relative to other countries in the Better Life Index. Ireland outperforms the average in jobs, education, health, social connections, safety and life satisfaction. It underperforms average in civic engagement. These assessments are based on available selected data.</p>
<p align="left">Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards. In Ireland,<strong>&nbsp;the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;29 488 a year</strong>, slightly lower than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;30 490 a year.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of employment,&nbsp;<strong>about 68% of people aged 15 to 64 in Ireland have a paid job</strong>, above the OECD employment average of 66%. Some 73% of men are in paid work, compared with 63% of women.<strong>&nbsp;In Ireland, 5% of employees work very long hours in paid work</strong>, below the OECD average of 10%, with 8% of men working very long hours in paid work compared with 2% of women.</p>
<p align="left">Good education and skills are important requisites for finding a job. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>85% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 79%. However, completion varies between men and women, as 83% of men have successfully completed high school compared with 88% of women. In terms of the quality of the education system,<strong>&nbsp;the average student scored 505 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)</strong>. This score is higher than the OECD average of 488. On average in Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>girls outperformed boys by 6 points</strong>, slightly above the average OECD gap of 5 points.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of health,&nbsp;<strong>life expectancy at birth in Ireland is around 83 years</strong>, two years higher than the OECD average of 81 years. Life expectancy for women is 85 years, compared with 81 for men.&nbsp;<strong>The level of atmospheric PM2.5</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; tiny air pollutant particles small enough to enter and cause damage to the lungs &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>is 7.8 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, below the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter. In Ireland, <strong>80% of people say they are satisfied with the quality of their water</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 84%.</p>
<p align="left">Concerning the public sphere, there is a strong sense of community and moderate levels of civic participation in Ireland, where<strong>&nbsp;96% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need</strong>, more than the OECD average of 91%. <strong>Voter turnout,</strong>&nbsp;a measure of citizens' participation in the political process,&nbsp;<strong>was 63% during recent elections</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 69%. Social and economic status can affect voting rates; voter turnout for the top 20% of the population is an estimated 66% and for the bottom 20% it is an estimated 60%.</p>
<p align="left">When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, Irish people gave it&nbsp;<strong>a 7 grade on average,&nbsp;higher than the OECD average of 6.7.</strong></p>

        <div class="span8">
            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Living in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people's lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. All of these elements help make a house a home. And of course there is the question whether people can afford adequate housing.</p>
<p align="left">Housing costs take up a large share of the household budget and represent the largest single expenditure for many individuals and families, by the time you add up elements such as rent, gas, electricity, water, furniture or repairs. In Ireland, households on average spend&nbsp;<strong>21% of their gross adjusted disposable income on keeping a roof over their heads</strong>, broadly in line with the OECD average of 20%.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">In addition to housing costs it is also important to examine living conditions, such as the average number of rooms shared per person and whether households have access to basic facilities. The number of rooms in a dwelling, divided by the number of persons living there, indicates whether residents are living in crowded conditions. Overcrowded housing may have a negative impact on physical and mental health, relations with others and children's development. In addition, dense living conditions are often a sign of inadequate water and sewage supply. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>the average home contains 2.1 rooms per person</strong>, more than the OECD average of 1.7 rooms per person. In terms of basic facilities,&nbsp;<strong>nearly every dwelling (99.8%) in Ireland contains private access to an indoor flushing toilet</strong>, more than the OECD average of 97%.</p>

<p align="left">While money may not buy happiness, it is an important means to achieving higher living standards and thus greater well-being. Higher economic wealth may also improve access to quality education, health care and housing.</p>
<p align="left">Household net adjusted disposable income is the amount of money that a household earns each year after taxes and transfers. It represents the money available to a household for spending on goods or services. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>the average household net adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;29 488</strong>&nbsp;a year, slightly lower than the OECD average of USD 30 490.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>the average household net wealth is estimated at USD&nbsp;370 341</strong>, higher than the OECD average of USD 323 960.</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p>Having a job brings many important benefits, including: providing a source of income, improving social inclusion, fulfilling one's own aspirations, building self-esteem and developing skills and competencies. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>about</strong>&nbsp;<strong>68% of the working-age population aged 15 to 64 has a paid job</strong>. This figure is higher than the OECD employment average of 66%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unemployed persons are defined as those who are not currently working but are willing to do so and actively searching for work. Long-term unemployment can have a large negative effect on feelings of well-being and self-worth and result in a loss of skills, further reducing employability. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>the percentage of the labour force that has been unemployed for a year or longer is currently at about 1.2%</strong>, slightly lower than the OECD average of 1.3%.</p>
<p>The wages and other monetary benefits that come with employment are an important aspect of job quality.&nbsp;<strong>Irish people earn&nbsp;USD&nbsp; 49 474 per year on average</strong>, this is in line with the OECD average of&nbsp;USD 49 165.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another essential factor of employment quality is job security, in terms of expected loss of earnings when someone becomes unemployed. This includes how likely you are to lose your job, how long you are likely to remain unemployed and how much financial assistance you can expect from government. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>workers face an expected 2.6% loss of earnings if they become unemployed</strong>, much below the OECD average of 5.1%.</p>

<p><em>Skills boosting</em></p>
<p>Ireland encourages the development of high level skills through sector specific training programmes.</p>
<p>Skillnets is Ireland's largest organisation supporting workplace training. It promotes and facilitates workplace training and upskilling by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Skillnets also heads a national programme that steers regional and sectoral SME training networks. These training plans are adapted to suit specific company workforces. Skillnets expanded in 2010 to provide training for jobseekers, including programmes like the Jobseeker Support Programme, which includes work placements. It had 70 operational networks, 30 of which were based on Dublin, and trained over 40 000 people in 2011.</p>
<p>The Momentum programme offers training for high level skills in line with the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work. The second phase of Momentum was launched in 2014 to provide up to 6 000 education and training places for the long-term unemployed to tackle skill shortages.</p>
<p>Springboard+ 2015 incorporates the Springboard programme and ICT Skills Conversion programme to place jobseekers in training courses. It will provide over 9 000 places in free part-time and full-time higher education reskilling and upskilling courses.

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. The Irish can expect to go through about&nbsp;<strong>17.9 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, in line with the OECD average of 18 years.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>85%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 79%.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>The average student in Ireland scored 505 in reading literacy, maths and sciences</strong>, above the OECD average of 488. The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

                <h2 align="left"><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Helping students succeed</em></p>
<p align="left">The Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) plan is an ongoing national policy for educational inclusion. It targets disadvantaged children through a standardised system that identifies each school&rsquo;s socio-economic level. Resources and support are then offered to schools, school clusters and/or communities through an integrated School Support Programme based on their level of need. Initiatives include: early childhood education, targeted student-teacher ratios, the professionalisation of school leaders and teachers, access to an administrative principal, measures to target deficits in literacy and numeracy, additional funding for books and libraries, guidance counselling, and facilitated access to higher education.</p>
<p align="left">Results show that these initiatives have had a positive impact on reading and mathematics scores in both urban and rural schools. School completion rates also rose from 68.2% (for 2001-07 cohorts) to 80.1% (for 2006-12 cohorts). Evaluations are planned to pinpoint which aspects of the policy lead to the best outcomes and to improve the programme.</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">The quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being. Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people's lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions,&nbsp;<strong>the health impacts of urban air pollution&nbsp;continue to worsen</strong>, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">PM2.5 &ndash; tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung &ndash; is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>PM2.5 levels are 7.8 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, much lower than the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter and lower than the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter set by the&nbsp;World Health Organization. Due to Ireland's location, weather patterns that supply predominantly clean air, the relative lack of heavy industry and the bans on coal burning in many urban areas since the early 1990s, air quality is generally good.</p>
<p align="left">Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>80% of people say they are satisfied with water quality</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 84%.</p>

<p align="left">Trust in government is essential for social cohesion and well-being. High voter turnout is a measure of citizens' participation in the political process.

<p align="left">Broader public engagement in the decision-making process is also important for holding the government to account and maintaining confidence in public institutions. The formal process for public engagement in developing laws and regulations is one way to measure the extent to which people can become involved in government decisions on key issues that affect their lives. In Ireland, the level of stakeholder engagement in developing regulations is 1.3 (on a scale between 0 and 4), lower than the OECD average of 2.1.</p>

<p align="left">A citizen-official joint working group and consultative events are supporting the drafting and implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s Open Government Partnership National Action Plan.</p>
<p align="left">Several consultative events have already taken place. A National Economic Dialogue allowed representatives from parliament, business, and civil society to engage in an open and inclusive exchange on competing economic and social priorities before the 2016 budget. Eleven Open Policy Debates have been held since early 2015, involving policy networks of practitioners, academics and experts on key issues. Before the National Action Plan, a Convention on the Constitution, comprised of 66 randomly selected citizens, 33 politicians and an independent chair, was created to consider and make recommendations for future Constitutional amendments. A referendum on marriage equality emerged from this consultation, along with 37 other recommendations &ndash; it was passed in 2015.</p>

<h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
</div>
<p align="left">Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care.&nbsp;<strong>Life</strong>&nbsp;<strong>expectancy at birth in Ireland stands at almost 83 years</strong>,&nbsp;two years above&nbsp;the OECD average of 81 years. Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher health care spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors).&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

Despite the subjective nature of this question, answers have been found to be a good predictor of people's future health care use. Gender, age and social status may affect answers to this question.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em>Involving youth and children</em></p>
<p align="left">Ireland is the first country in Europe to develop a cross-government National Strategy on Children and Young People's Participation in decision-making. The Strategy gives young people aged up to 24 (though it targets youth under 18) a voice in decision-making.</p>
<p align="left">At the local level, youth participate in child and youth councils. Operating in all 31 localities, young people express their voice by working on topics of importance to their age group and by acting as a consultative forum for adult decision makers in the locality.</p>
<p align="left">Every council has an Annual General Meeting where 80-200 youth come together to express their opinions. Biannually, two hundred youth from the local councils are elected to the National Youth Parliament. Each council also elects a representative to sit on the National Executive, which implements the top recommendations from the previous National Youth Parliament.

<p align="left">Finding a suitable balance between work and life is a challenge for all workers, especially working parents. The ability to successfully combine work, family commitments and personal life is important for the well-being of all members in a household. Governments can help to address the issue by encouraging supportive and flexible working practices, making it easier for parents to strike a better balance between work and home life.</p>
<p align="left">An important aspect of work-life balance is the amount of time a person spends at work. Evidence suggests that long work hours may impair personal health, jeopardise safety and increase stress. In Ireland,&nbsp;<strong>some 5%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of employees work very long hours in paid work</strong>, much less than the OECD average of 10%.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

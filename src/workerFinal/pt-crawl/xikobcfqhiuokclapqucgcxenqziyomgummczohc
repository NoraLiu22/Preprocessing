              as a professor, though she taught for nearly 30 years. Yet in order 
              to turn the Radium Institute into a world-class institution, Curie 
              shamelessly sought out assistance, just as she had done during the 
              war years to create the radiological service. Throughout her career 
              Curie had benefitted from the subsidies of wealthy French benefactors. 
              Now, thanks to the interest of an American woman, U.S. citizens 
              also became involved in filling the needs of the Radium Institute.

            her distrust of journalists, in May 1920 Curie agreed to give an interview 
            to Mrs. William Brown Meloney, editor of an American women's magazine. 
            In the interview Curie emphasized the needs of her institution, where 
            research was just resuming following the devastating war.<br>
            <br>
            Thanks to her alliance with industry, few labs in the world if any were better equipped with radium 
            than Curie's. But Curie succeeded in shocking Meloney by emphasizing the fact that 
            research and therapy centers in the United States together had about 
            50 times as much radium as the single gram she--the scientist who 
            had discovered the element--had in her laboratory. When Meloney learned 
            that Curie's most fervent wish was for a second gram for her laboratory, 
            the editor organized a &#147;Marie Curie Radium Campaign.&#148;</font></td>

              States himself would present Curie with the gift of radium, French 
              officials looked for a way to make up for past oversights. Curie 
              refused the Legion of Honor award (as Pierre had refused it nearly 
              two decades earlier). But she agreed to attend a benefit for the

              with liberal and socialist politicians, and they supported political 
              parties that would increase government funding. Despite her shyness 
              Marie helped in the work of lobbying, going with her friends from 
              office to office. She could argue fervently, but her appearance 
              alone was the strongest argument. A frail and aging woman dressed

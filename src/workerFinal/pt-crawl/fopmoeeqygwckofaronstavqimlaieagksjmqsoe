/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 418]]</font> That the 
          great Oceanic Basins, as well as the land areas of the globe, have persisted 
          throughout a large portion, if not the whole, of known geological time, 
          is a proposition which has been accepted by writers of such eminence, 
          and is supported by so many distinct lines of evidence, that it seemed 
          likely to become one of the established teachings of geology. Professor 
          Dana was led to it by a study of the development of the North American 
          Continent; Darwin upheld it from his study of Oceanic Islands, and the 
          facts he adduced have since been strengthened by the discovery that 
          the two supposed exceptions to the generalisation that no ancient sedimentary 
          rocks occur on such islands--Rodriguez and St. Paul's Rocks--are no 
          exceptions at all. Two successive heads of the Geological Survey of 
          Great Britain, Sir Andrew Ramsay and Sir Archibald Geikie, have advocated 
          similar views; while Mr. John Murray, of the &quot;Challenger,&quot; holds that 
          the vast mass of evidence now accumulated as to the nature of the deposits 
          on the floors of the great oceans, indicates that they are distinct 
          in character and origin from any of the widespread formations which 
          make up the series of the sedimentary rocks. Coming to the subject from 
          a totally different point of view, that of the physicist and mathematician, 
          the Rev. Osmond Fisher arrives at similar results. In the latest issue 
          of his important work, &quot;Physics of the Earth's Crust,&quot; he gives as one 
          of his conclusions--&quot;and lastly, that the great oceanic and continental 
          areas have never changed places&quot;; and, in the summary of the whole work, 
          he says: &quot;The occupation of an entire hemisphere by one great ocean 
          is a remarkable circumstance, and we have seen reason for believing 
          that this is a very ancient division of the surface, and that it is 
          probably a mistake to suppose that every part of it has been sometimes 
          raised above the sea, and sometimes depressed beneath it. The truth 
          seems to be, that the region subject to these alterations of conditions 
          does not extend very far away from the present coast lines.&quot;
        </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When studying the causes which have brought about 
          the geographical distribution of animals, I was compelled to deal with 
          this question, because I found that it had been the custom of many writers 
          to solve all anomalies of distribution by the creation of hypothetical 
          lands, bridging across the great oceans in various directions <font color="990000">[[p. 
          419]]</font> and at many different epochs; and, having arrived at the 
          conclusion that the distribution of organisms could be more harmoniously 
          and consistently explained without such changes of sea and land, which 
          usually created greater difficulties than those they were intended to 
          explain, I gave, in my &quot;Island Life&quot; a brief statement of the evidence 
          which appeared to me to render such changes exceedingly improbable. 
          This evidence was mainly a summary of the facts and arguments adduced 
          by the eminent men referred to above, and to this I added in my &quot;Darwinism&quot; 
          a difficulty founded on mechanical considerations which seemed to me 
          to furnish a preliminary reason why we should not accept the doctrine 
          of the interchange of continental and oceanic areas without very clear 
          and cogent reasons. Since then some other arguments of this nature have 
          occurred to me, and as the theory of permanence has been recently attacked, 
          by Mr. W. T. Blanford in his presidential address to the Geological 
          Society in 1890, and by Mr. Jukes-Browne in his &quot;Building of the British 
          Isles,&quot; it may be as well to consider these difficulties, which furnish, 
          in my opinion, a very powerful argument against the interchange of oceanic 
          and continental areas, and which has the advantage of not requiring 
          any knowledge of the higher mathematics in order to estimate its validity. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, first, it is necessary to clear away some misconceptions 
          as to the proposition I really uphold, since arguments have been adduced 
          which in no way affect that proposition. Thus, Mr. Jukes-Browne quotes 
          Professor Prestwich as saying, &quot;It is only the deeper portions of the 
          great ocean troughs that can claim the high antiquity now advocated 
          for them by many eminent American and English geologists.&quot; But this 
          is all that is claimed. For practical purposes I at first took the 1,000-fathom 
          line as, generally and roughly, indicating the separation between the 
          oceanic and the continental areas, because at that time it did accurately 
          divide the continental from the oceanic islands, as defined by a combination 
          of geological and biological characters. It has, however, been since 
          shown that two ancient continental islands--Madagascar and New Zealand--are 
          separated from their respective continents by depths of more than 1,000 
          fathoms. We must, therefore, go as far as 1,500-, or, perhaps, in a 
          few cases, to the 2,000-fathom line, and this will surely mark out &quot;the 
          deeper portions of the great ocean basins,&quot; since only isolated areas 
          exceed 3,000 fathoms.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if we look at the deep ocean basins marked 
          out by the 2,000-fathom line, not on Mercator's projection which greatly 
          exaggerates the shallower portion situated in the temperate and polar 
          regions, but on an equal-area projection, such as the map which illustrates 
          Mr. J. Murray's paper,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> we shall see that 
          by far the larger part of all the great oceans are included by this 
          line, and that, for <font color="990000">[[p. 420]]</font> the purpose 
          of indicating the isolation of the continents from each other throughout 
          the equatorial and most of the temperate zones, there is very little 
          to choose between the 1,000-fathom or the 2,000-fathom boundary. The 
          latter, however, allows more scope for possible land extensions between 
          the three southern continents and the Antarctic lands, which, during 
          mild epochs, and by means of intervening islands, may, perhaps, have 
          served as a means of communication between these continents. All that 
          is necessary to maintain, therefore, is that existing continents with 
          their included seas, and their surrounding oceanic waters as far as 
          the 1,500-fathom, or in some extreme cases the 2,000-fathom line, mark 
          out the areas within which the continental lands of the globe have been 
          built up; while the oceanic areas beyond the 2,000-fathom line, constituting, 
          according to Mr. Murray's data, 71 per cent. of the whole ocean, have 
          almost certainly been ocean throughout all known geological time.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will now be seen that this is a problem which 
          deals with the very broadest contrasts of the earth's surface, and that 
          its fundamental data are on so vast a scale as not to be materially 
          affected by the smaller details of physical geography, or by differences 
          of opinion as to the exact meaning of certain terms. Whether a particular 
          island is more correctly classed as oceanic or continental, whether 
          a certain portion of the ocean should be placed within the oceanic or 
          the continental area, and whether certain rocks were formed in very 
          deep or in comparatively shallow water, are of slight importance, except 
          in so far as they may throw light on the real question, which is, whether 
          the vast expanses of ocean beyond the 1,000-fathom line, forming about 
          92 per cent. of the whole oceanic area, have ever been occupied, or 
          extensively bridged over, by continental land. It is towards the solution 
          of this great problem that I now propose to submit certain general considerations 
          which appear to me to lie at the root of the whole matter.

          the paper already referred to, Mr. John Murray has carefully estimated 
          both the area of the land and of the water on the earth's surface, and 
          their bulk as deduced from the best available data. Taking the whole 
          area of the globe as 100, he finds the land surface to be 28, the water 
          surface 72. But the mean height of the land above sea-level is 2,250 
          feet, while the mean depth of all the oceans and seas is 12,456 feet. 
          In this estimate, however, all the inland seas and shallow coast waters 
          are included, and as these, at least as far as the 100-fathom line, 
          are universally admitted to be within the &quot;continental area,&quot; we omit 
          them in our estimate of the mean depth of the oceans proper, which are 
          thus brought to something over 15,000 feet, or nearly seven times as 
          much as the mean height of the land.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 421]]</font> 
          The accompanying diagram (taken from my book on &quot;Darwinism&quot;) will better 
          enable the reader to appreciate these proportions, which are of vital 
          importance in the problem under discussion. The lengths of the two parts 
          of the diagram are in proportion to the areas of land and ocean respectively, 
          the vertical dimensions showing the comparative mean height and depth. 
          It follows that the areas of the two shaded portions are proportional 
          to the bulk of the continents and oceans respectively.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mean depths of the several oceans 
          and the mean heights of the several continents do not differ enough 
          from each other to render this diagram a very inaccurate representation 
          of the proportion between any of the continents and their adjacent oceans; 
          and it will therefore serve, roughly, to keep before the mind what must 
          have taken place if oceanic and continental areas had ever changed places. 
          It will, I presume, be admitted that, on any large scale, elevation 
          and subsidence must nearly balance each other, and, thus, in order that 
          any area of continental magnitude should rise from the ocean floor till 
          it formed fairly elevated dry land, some corresponding area must sink</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../pics/S453.jpg" width="50%" height="auto" /></p>
        <p align="left">to a like extent. But if such subsiding area formed a 
          part or the whole of a continent, the land would entirely disappear 
          beneath the waters of the ocean (except a few mountain peaks) long before 
          the corresponding part of the ocean floor had approached the surface. 
          In order, therefore, to make any such interchange possible, without 
          the total disappearance of the greater portion of the subsiding continent 
          before the new one had appeared to take its place, we must make some 
          arbitrary assumptions. We must suppose either that when one portion 
          of the ocean floor rose, some other part of that floor sank to greater 
          depths till the new continent approached the surface, or, that the sinking 
          of a whole continent was balanced by the rising of a comparatively small 
          area of the ocean floor. Of course, either of these assumed changes 
          are conceivable and, perhaps, possible; but it seems to me that they 
          are exceedingly improbable, and that to assume that they have occurred 
          again and again, as part of the regular course of the earth's history, 
          leads us into enormous difficulties. Consider, for a moment, what would 
          be implied by the building up of a continent the size of Africa from 
          the mean depth of the ocean. By <font color="990000">[[p. 422]]</font> 
          comparing the area of Africa with that of the whole of the land, and 
          the depth of the ocean with the mean height of the land, we shall find 
          that if all the land of the globe above sea-level could be transferred 
          to mid-ocean, it would not be sufficient to form the new continent, 
          but would still leave it nearly 2,000 feet beneath the surface. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It thus appears that, if the elevation of the ocean 
          floor, and the corresponding sinking of whole continents, constitute 
          a portion of the regular change and development of the earth's surface, 
          there would be not only a chance but a great probability of entire continents 
          disappearing beneath the waters before new continents had risen to take 
          their place. Even the total disappearance of all the large land masses 
          might easily happen; for we see from the diagram that they might one 
          after the other disappear with a corresponding rise of the adjacent 
          portion of the ocean bed and still leave the ocean over the whole earth 
          almost as deep as it is now. But, as will be shown further on, the geological 
          record, imperfect as it is, teaches us that no such submergences have 
          ever taken place.
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contour of the Ocean Floor as indicating Permanence.</i>--Before 
          extensive soundings revealed the depth of the ocean and the form of 
          its floor, it was supposed that it would exhibit irregularities corresponding 
          to those of the land, such as mountain-ranges, great valleys, escarpments, 
          ravines, &amp;c. But we now know that the main characteristic of the 
          ocean floor is, that it is a vast undulating plain, the slopes rarely 
          exceeding a hundred feet in a mile except near the margins of the continental 
          areas, while usually the gradients are so slight that they would be 
          hardly perceptible. Contrast this with the forms of all mountain ranges 
          whose general rise for long distances is often five hundred feet in 
          a mile, while slopes at angles of from 20&deg; to 60&deg; are by no 
          means uncommon.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if we suppose that considerable portions of 
          the ocean depths have been formed by the subsidence of continents, we 
          should certainly expect to find some indication of those surface features 
          which characterise all continents, but which appear to be absent from 
          all deep oceans. In order to account for the actual contours of the 
          ocean on this theory, we must suppose that, during subsidence, all the 
          mountain ranges, peaks, valleys, and precipices were reduced to an almost 
          uniform level surface by marine denudation, which, unless, the process 
          of subsidence were incredibly slow, seems most improbable. Mr. Jukes-Browne, 
          however, does not hold the view that they have been thus denuded, for 
          he approvingly quotes Mr. Crosby as saying that--&quot;the oceanic islands 
          are, of course, merely the tops of submerged mountains, and it is only 
          with the highest points of continents that they can properly be compared.&quot; 
          If this is correct, then we ought to find in the vicinity of such islands 
          all the chief features of submerged mountain ranges--precipices, deep 
          valleys and ravines, arranged in diverging groups as they always <font color="990000">[[p. 
          423]]</font> occur in nature. But in no single case, that I am aware 
          of, have any such features been discovered. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a still greater difficulty remains to be considered. 
          If oceanic and continental areas are interchangeable, it can only be 
          because the very same causes (whatever they may be) that produce elevations 
          and subsidences in the one produce them also in the other, and at first 
          sight it appears probable that this would be the case. But if these 
          causes have been at work upon the ocean floor throughout geological 
          epochs, they would have produced irregularities of surface not less 
          but far greater than on subaerial land. This must be so, because subaerial 
          denudation continually neutralises much of the effect of upheaval in 
          the continental areas, while in the ocean depths no such cause or anything 
          analogous to it is in operation.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The forces which have been at work in every mountainous 
          region have sometimes tilted up great masses of rock at high angles, 
          upheaved them into huge anticlinal curves, or crushed them by lateral 
          pressure into repeated folds, which in some cases appear to have fallen 
          over so as to reverse the succession of the strata. But, notwithstanding 
          these various forms of upheaval, involving vertical displacements which 
          are sometimes several miles in extent, the surface of the land often 
          shows no corresponding irregularities, owing to the fact that subaerial 
          denudation has either kept pace with upheaval or has even exceeded it, 
          so that the position of an anticlinal ridge may be, and often is, represented 
          by a valley. Now, if we suppose that similar forces have been at work 
          on that portion of the earth's surface forming the bed of the ocean, 
          where there are no such counteracting agencies, we should expect to 
          find irregularities in the ocean floor far greater than those which 
          occur upon the land surface.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still more difficult to explain would be the absence 
          of precipitous escarpments due to faults, which, though frequently showing 
          an upthrow or downthrow of the strata to the amount of many hundreds 
          and sometimes thousands of feet, rarely exhibit any difference of level 
          on the land surface, owing to the fact that subaerial denudation has 
          kept pace with slow and intermittent elevation. But in the ocean depths 
          no such denudation is going on; and we can therefore only account for 
          its very uniform surface on the supposition that it is not subject to 
          the varied and complex subterranean movements which have certainly acted 
          within the continental areas throughout known geological time.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equal Range of the Geological Record in all the 
          Continents.</i>--There is one other general consideration which indicates 
          the permanence and continuity of the Continental Areas, and which renders 
          it very <font color="990000">[[p. 424]]</font> difficult, if not impossible, 
          to suppose that they have ever changed places with the great oceans. 
          It is, that on all the present continents we find either the same or 
          a closely parallel series of geological formations, from the most ancient 
          to the most recent. Not only do we find Pal&aelig;ozoic, Mesozoic, and 
          Cainozoic rocks everywhere present, but, in proportion as the continents 
          are explored geologically, we find a tolerably complete series of the 
          chief formations. From Laurentian to Carboniferous and Permian, from 
          Trias to Cretaceous, and from Eocene to Quaternary, the geological series 
          appears to be fairly represented not only in continents, but also to 
          a considerable extent in the large continental islands, such as Great 
          Britain and New Zealand. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this is certainly not what we should expect 
          if the present continental areas had, at different epochs, risen out 
          of the deep oceans. In that case some would have commenced their geological 
          history at a later period than others, having either a late Pal&aelig;ozoic 
          or some Mesozoic formation, or even an early Tertiary for their lowest 
          stratified rock. Others, which had become oceanic for the first time 
          at a later epoch, would exhibit an enormous gap in the series, either 
          several of the Mesozoic formations, for example, being absent, or some 
          considerable portion of both Pal&aelig;ozoic and Mesozoic, or Mesozoic 
          and Tertiary. This would necessarily be the case, because we cannot 
          believe that so vast a change as the subsidence of an entire continent 
          till its site became a deep ocean, and its subsequent elevation till 
          it again became dry land, could possibly be effected in any less extended 
          periods, if at all.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever such gaps, or smaller ones, now occur locally, 
          they are generally held to imply the existence of terrestrial conditions, 
          as in the case of China, which, according to Richthoven, has been continental 
          since the Carboniferous epoch. In many cases there is distinct evidence 
          of such conditions in lacustrine or freshwater deposits, dirt-beds, 
          &amp;c. But if a gap of such vast extent both in space and time as that 
          here referred to were caused by the interchange of a continent and a 
          deep ocean, the fact that it was so produced would be clearly evidenced 
          by an almost uniform deposit either of organic or clayey ooze, similar 
          to those now everywhere forming over the oceanic area. Even if we make 
          the fullest allowance for denudation during elevation, sufficient indications 
          of so widespread a formation should be detected. Such a deposit would, 
          in fact, have every chance of being largely preserved, because, long 
          before it rose to the level where it would be subject to denudation 
          by waves or currents, it would, almost everywhere, be overlain by a 
          series of shore deposits, and wherever these latter were preserved on 
          the land surface the oceanic formation would necessarily be found under 
          them. That no such enormous deficiency in the geological series characterises 
          any of the continents, and that no widespread deposit of organic or 
          clayey ooze at some <font color="990000">[[p. 425]]</font> definite 
          horizon has been anywhere detected, though such a deposit must have 
          been formed and largely preserved if the whole or any considerable part 
          of a continent had risen from ocean depths at any period of its history, 
          constitutes of itself a very strong argument against any such interchange 
          of oceanic and continental areas having occurred. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have now shown that there are three distinct groups 
          of phenomena which are either altogether inconsistent with any general 
          interchange of oceanic and continental areas, or which render it exceedingly 
          difficult to understand how such interchange could have been brought 
          about. These phenomena are:--(1) The enormous disproportion between 
          the mean height of the land and the mean depth of the ocean, which would 
          render it very difficult for new land to reach the surface till long 
          after the total submergence of the sinking continent. (2) The wonderful 
          uniformity of level over by far the greater part of the ocean floor, 
          which indicates that it is not subject to the same disturbing agencies 
          which throughout all geological time have been creating irregularities 
          in the land-surface, irregularities which would be far greater than 
          they are were they not continually counteracted by the lowering and 
          equalising effects of subaerial denudation. (3) The remarkable parallelism 
          and completeness of the series of geological formations in all the best 
          known continents and larger continental islands, indicating that none 
          of them have risen from the ocean floor during any portion of known 
          geological history, a conclusion enforced by the absence from any of 
          them of that general deposit of oceanic ooze at some definite horizon, 
          which would be at once the result and proof of any such tremendous episode 
          in their past history. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I submit that these facts, and the conclusions to 
          be logically deduced from them, form a very powerful <i>&agrave; priori</i> 
          argument as against those who maintain the interchange of continents 
          and oceans as a means of explaining certain isolated geological or biological 
          phenomena; such, for instance, as the much-disputed origin of the chalk, 
          or the supposed necessity for land-communication to explain the distribution 
          of certain groups of reptiles or fishes in remote geological times. 
          Before postulating such vast revolutions of the terrestrial surface 
          in order to cut the gordian knot of difficulties which may be mainly 
          due to imperfect knowledge, it will be necessary to show that the considerations 
          here adduced, as well as the great body of facts which have caused many 
          eminent geologists, naturalists, and physicists to hold the doctrine 
          of oceanic permanence, are either illogical or founded on incorrect 
          data. For, surely, no one will suggest that so vast a problem of terrestrial 
          physics can be held to be solved till we have exhausted all the evidence 
          at our command, and have shown that it largely preponderates on one 
          side or the other.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present article is intended to supply 
          a hitherto unnoticed class of arguments for oceanic permanence, and 
          these must of course <font color="990000">[[p. 426]]</font> be taken 
          in connection with the other evidence which has been summarised in the 
          6th chapter of the writer's &quot;Island Life,&quot; and also with the admirable 
          &quot;Summary&quot; of the purely physical argument in the 2nd edition of Mr. 
          O. Fisher's &quot;Physics of the Earth's Crust.&quot; It is certainly a remarkable 
          fact that writers approaching the subject from so many distinct points 
          of view--as have Professor Dana, Mr. Darwin, Sir Archibald Geikie, Dr. 
          John Murray, Rev. O. Fisher, and myself--should yet arrive at what is 
          substantially an identical conclusion; and this must certainly be held 
          to afford a strong presumption that that conclusion is a correct one.</p>

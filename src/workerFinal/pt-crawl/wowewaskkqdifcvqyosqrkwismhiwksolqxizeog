	Now we fast forward to 1827 where <font color="FF0000"><b>Robert Brown</b></font>, a British botanist, 
	is observing a suspended pollen grain in water. While looking at this pollen grain underneath a microscope, he 
	notices that it undergoes a type of 
	<font color="0000FF"><b>random walk.</b></font>  The figure below depicts<a href="references.html"><sup>6</sup></a>
	  the type of random, seemingly 
	unpredictable motion, that the suspended particle underwent. <br><br>

	<br>
	This random motion is now referred to as <font color="FF0000"><b> BROWNIAN MOTION</b></font>, but the motion itself
	may be easily remembered as the <i>"Drunken Sailor Walk"</i>.<br><br>
	At first Brown attributed this motion to signs of life.  However, when he repeated the experiment with an inorganic
	body he observed the same motion.

	Now the phenomenon of Brownian motion has been discovered, but... <br><br>
	<center><font color="FF0000"><b> HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THIS SEEMINGLY RANDOM MOTION?</b></font></center><br>
	This question leads to two school of thought and a debate that lasted for 68 years!<br><br>

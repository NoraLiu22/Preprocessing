The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum&#8217;s rules, and these Terms of Use. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding on you and the Company.</p>
<p class="Paragraph"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Waiver of Jury Trial</span>. YOU AND THE COMPANY EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and the Company are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms of Use as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. In any litigation between you and the Company over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and the Company waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have a judge resolve the dispute.</p>
<p class="Paragraph"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</span>. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor the Company is entitled to arbitration. Instead, all claims and disputes will then be resolved in, and you and the Company agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of, the state or federal courts having jurisdiction over Travis County, Texas.</p>

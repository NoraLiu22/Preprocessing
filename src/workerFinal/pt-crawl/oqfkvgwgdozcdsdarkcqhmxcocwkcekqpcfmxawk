<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Now in its seventh annual edition, the Sight and Sound poll for the best video essays of the year surveys the online sphere, film festivals and audiovisual research in almost equal measure. Its primary purposes are to mark notable works and keep track of the various schools of thought concerning what video essays can or should be, and how they can communicate to a range of audiences.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>The poll was conducted with the assistance of 48 voters from 17 countries, including academics, critics, online creators and festival curators. Together, their 260 nominations include 181 distinct titles. Given the scope and abundance of recent video essays, even an extensive poll can only provide a cross-section of the topics, forms and rhetoric of their contemporary practice – a limitation many voters noted in their submissions. Of the nominated works, 47% were created by male video essayists, 39% by female, with several from non-binary creators and mixed teams. Around two-thirds feature voiceover, with the majority presented in English, although 14 languages feature in the overall poll.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>The nominations saw a relatively equal split between essays created for YouTube and those created for academic research, with 50 YouTube and 47 academic videos (or entire series). Publicly available videos’ viewership varies broadly, from 9.5 million views (for <a href="https://youtu.be/5wAo54DHDY0?si=64cLsJYtzrCSlIXg">MyHouse.wad</a>) to the low double digits; participants were keen to highlight new and underseen works as well as celebrating the achievements of established creators. Festival films or installation pieces also proved popular, with 53 arthouse shorts, features and documentaries nominated. Also present, although in a smaller proportion, were self-published Vimeo works or collaborative projects unaffiliated with a specific institution. However, within the yearly <span class="caps">S&amp;S</span> poll for video essays, there seems to be a slight decline both in independently produced and published Vimeo content, and in video output by cinephile magazines, while the academic sector is slowly but constantly expanding.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>The average runtime was 27 minutes, with most around the 15 minute mark – although a few marathon nominations like Will DiGravio’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/841294355">Against Polish</a> and Adam Curtis’ <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0d3hwl1/russia-19851999-traumazone">TraumaZone</a> (three and seven hours respectively) stick out. Three videos were one minute long or shorter.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Leading the nominations, Maryam Tafakory and Johannes Binotto tie for 10 nominations, with Tafakory’s split-screen work <a href="https://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste">chaste/unchaste</a> and Binotto’s <a href="https://blog.hslu.ch/videoessay/johannes-binotto-practices-of-viewing-description/">Practices</a> <a href="https://blog.hslu.ch/videoessay/johannes-binotto-practices-of-viewing-color/">of</a> <a href="https://blog.hslu.ch/videoessay/practices-viewing-distance/">Viewing</a> series coming out on top. <a href="https://www.ahistoryoftheworldaccordingtogettyimages.com/">A History of the World According to Getty Images</a> by Richard Misek received nine nominations, the most for a single work. Returning essayists of note include Chloé Galibert-Laîné, Barbara Zecchi and Ariel Avissar, while new entrants with multiple nominations include Occitane Lacurie (three noms for Xena’s Body: A Menstrual Auto-Investigation Using an iPhone) and James DeLisio (four nominations for <a href="https://youtu.be/wV8BnxuPF2Y?si=WFcpR127IAGAFaEW">Cinema in Pain: Decoding “Mad God”</a>).</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>It is worth noting that some videos appear in consecutive polls: among them, Misek’s History of the World According to Getty Images and Galibert-Laîné’s <a href="https://www.chloegalibertlaine.com/geomarkr">GeoMarkr</a> are now available online, while in <a href="/sight-and-sound/polls/best-video-essays-2022">the 2022 poll</a> they were occasionally mentioned, but less widely seen. It is often the case that videos travel in festivals or are viewed in conferences and among peers before being made public. While the current poll has several dozen videos to which we cannot presently direct our readers, we hope that in the near future many will be similarly available with unrestricted access.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Videographic collaborations make up a number of nominations in this years’ list. <a href="https://mediacommons.org/intransition/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-94-2023">Once upon a Screen: Vol. 2</a>, edited by Avissar and Evelyn Kreutzer, returns with two nominations for its second instalment. <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/9576546">Moving Poems</a>, also curated by Kreutzer, received five nominations, chiefly for Desiree de Jesus’ a raisin in the sun. And the <a href="https://www.16-9.dk/kategori/media/">169 Seconds</a> series, commissioned by Danish journal 16:9 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, received three nominations, including returning essayists Catherine Grant and Jason Mittell. Independent videographic community <a href="https://theessaylibrary.com/">The Essay Library</a> also features with one nomination for Lara Callaghan’s contribution to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzHhdsb5LkA">When Essay Met Library</a> collaboration.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A number of essays were published through new academic journals, including Zeitschrift für Medienwissenschaft with five videos nominated; other new entrants include Teknokultura and Feminist Media Histories. [in]Transition, Tecmerin and <span class="caps">NECSUS</span> are by now certified in making the works they publish visible among videographic researchers.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Independent streaming service <a href="https://nebula.tv/">Nebula</a> has continued to grow its base of creators, many of whom are video essayists. Out of 50 unique YouTube videos, seven were also published on Nebula. Three of these were directly cross-posted, another three were Nebula First (published earlier than YouTube), and one nomination – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIwwJGhbDb8">We Must Destroy What the Bomb Cannot</a> by Big Joel – was a Nebula Plus video, meaning it includes extra content beyond what is available on YouTube. Lily Alexandre’s Nebula-first essay <a href="https://youtu.be/OuaDbu_VBLY?si=YMVVLrvetpI1Dmtx">Everything Is Sludge: Art in the Post-Human Era</a> received three nods, bringing the total number of Nebula nominations up to nine.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Billed as a <a href="https://variety.com/2023/streaming/news/nebula-ceo-dave-wiskus-interview-1235782591/">creator-first streaming service</a>, Nebula aims to give its creators the freedom that they cannot find on YouTube. Many video essayists have joined Nebula after finding their work coming up against YouTube’s advertiser-friendly guidelines, restricting the discussion of mature topics. In February 2023, Maggie Mae Fish launched her series <a href="https://nebula.tv/unrated">Unrated</a> exploring sexuality in film, and Broey Deschanel followed suit in November with the <a href="https://nebula.tv/taboo">Taboo on Screen</a> series. There’s an oft-noted divide between ‘Vimeo-style’ essays – with their more academic leaning and longer clip length – and YouTube essays – with their quick cuts and <a href="https://medium.com/@tonyszhou/postmortem-1b338537fabc">careful stepping around automatic copyright claims</a>. This gap may be quickly closing, although whether a Nebula style will arise remains to be seen.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Although content creators can make money through AdSense and sponsorships on YouTube, many turn to community donations and subscriptions to fund their work. Forty-one of the nominated YouTube works included a link to Patreon, Ko-fi or PayPal in the video description. One nominated video, Brad Troemel’s <a href="https://youtu.be/sXYV-VUPneA?si=NOAXouLQBjMVTWGj">The Literalists</a>, is available exclusively on Patreon, with only a trailer uploaded to YouTube.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Vimeo essayists have also encountered in greater force the problems that have plagued YouTube essayists for years. Formerly a safe haven for video essays containing copyrighted materials, Vimeo has enacted a slew of copyright claims, viewing restrictions and takedowns on well-known video essays in recent months. This brings to mind Fandor’s 2016/2017 removal of multiple video essays from their channels in response to the threat of copyright claims, ringing alarm bells about the mixed potential of the Internet as an archive for videographic work. The long-running <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/8660446"><span class="caps">TV</span> Dictionary</a> project is just one example with multiple claims, despite its clear origin in academic research practice.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Nostalgia and memory, pop culture and cinephilia – sometimes mixed together – loom large in this year’s list, due in part to some popular academic series including <a href="https://indyvinyl.gla.ac.uk/indy-vinyl-for-the-masses/">Indy Vinyl for the Masses</a> (curated by Ian Garwood) and the <a href="https://tecmerin.uc3m.es/project/screen-stars-dictionary/?lang=en">Screen Stars Dictionary</a> (curated by Tecmerin and Ariel Avissar). Gender as spectacle makes its appearance in several videos, from the mainstream end of the spectrum (max teeth’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlu-Ffdxocc&amp;ab_channel=maxteeth">The Man/Car Gender Binary in John Carpenter’s Christine</a>) to critical discussions of star personae, cinema’s archetypal female protagonists as well as filmmaking/media practices (Morgane Frund’s short films, among other titles), to direct references to Laura Mulvey and Judith Butler at the other end.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>As with all other areas of discourse this year, <span class="caps">AI</span> featured in multiple videos, usually more as a thematic concern than as a videographic tool (although text-to-speech and some generative techniques feature in the list). Futurism more generally, whether dystopian or utopian, was a common theme in the YouTube nominations.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Interrogation of the video essay form itself continues to stimulate discussion within the field, including the drawing to a close of Johannes Binotto’s popular Practices of Viewing series. While this self-reflexivity was <a href="/sight-and-sound/polls/best-video-essays-2021">first noted in the 2021 poll</a>, it was seen more on YouTube in 2023, with videos ranging from <a href="https://youtu.be/t41M_E7BvDo?si=_-BKe5YuveA7jveS">assessing the state of the video essay landscape</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/sEEBKbCvDJE?si=caP9Ha_aIIOjHUZ8">dispensing advice about how to be a successful video essayist</a>. Harris Michael Brewis, better known as hbomberguy, released a nearly four-hour <a href="https://youtu.be/yDp3cB5fHXQ?si=aR6n5X0sHj65SkWp">exposé of plagiarism on YouTube</a> with a particular focus on video essays. The video passed two million views within 24 hours of its publication.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>While there are certainly great videos that remained unmentioned even with such dedicated teamwork on behalf of all voters, the present survey should be a solid starting point (and, in a few years’ time, a reminder) of the state of video essays in 2023. Thank you to everyone who participated.</p></div>

By jumping between the indistinct traces of <span class="caps">CLODO</span>, a terrorist group that bombed computer companies in 1980s France, it denies the pretension that the desktop interface is there ‘for us’ to make content readily available and uncovers the fundamental lack and self-destructivity of contemporary visual regimes.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A fascinating extension of the videographic impulse into a live performance. Lenay uses Zoom software to embody the experience of participating in the 1996 Summer Olympics and shakes our notions of audiovisual archives as well as the politics of individual and collective bodies.</p></div>

Čákanyová achieves it through a catalogue of experimental techniques that turn photochemical as well as digital images into emblems of an indistinct future in which we yet have to find our place.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A whimsically inventive video essay that resurrects the early 2000s’ teletext interface not just for its nostalgic appeal but chiefly for its unique temporality and inclusiveness.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A rare piece of videographic criticism that reworks a short Czechoslovak non-fiction film from the 1940s. Images of post-war reconstruction are poetically deconstructed to give voice to overlooked details and actors that shaped the spectacle in the first place.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Yazdandoost’s video, exploring the use of the arbitrary motion of fur in Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs and other stop-motion films, is an absolute treat, start to finish. It was made under the mentorship of Catherine Grant, as part of a wonderful videographic symposium held in Hanover late last year, where I first got to see it — and was published earlier this year in the ZfM blog Videography, which followed that symposium. Don’t miss it — and also check out her shorter, lovely video, <a href="https://vimeo.com/866170709">Wes Anderson’s Trains</a>.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>In another video first presented at the Hanover conference and published this year on the ZfM blog, Zecchi offers a 4-part exploration of the use of Italian accents in Hollywood films. Starting from House of Gucci, it examines various screen representations of Italians and Italian Americans and the political and ideological dimensions of the accented voice (following Zecchi’s<a href="https://vimeo.com/680718777"> previous work</a> on the subject). It is insightful, entertaining and highly inventive, experimenting with a diverse range of videographic techniques and forms of voiceover.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>One of the explicit inspirations for Zecchi’s video above, <span class="caps">O’L</span>eary’s is a tour de force of parametric criticism, or what he calls a form of “cyborg scholarship”. It is a fascinating and highly generative piece, and remains playful throughout; <span class="caps">O’L</span>early must have had a lot of fun while making it, like a child playing with Lego. It would be difficult to explain here just what the video does with its subject material (three narrative films made about the 2008 financial crash); luckily, <span class="caps">O’L</span>eary has already done that himself, in the accompanying creator’s statement, which you should definitely read prior to watching the video if you want any chance of figuring out what the hell is going on!</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Evelyn Kreutzer’s Moving Poems collection, which pairs poems with moving images, has generated some remarkable works over the past couple of years. This video by de Jesús is one of the standout pieces. It places the 1961 adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun in dialogue with Langston Hughes’s “Harlem”, from which its title was derived. It is an intelligent and complex piece, employing multiple, dense layerings of image, sound and text, and will benefit from repeat viewings. Check it out, as well as the <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/9576546">other pieces in the collection</a> – and consider contributing your own.</p></div>

You’d better watch Nathan Fielder’s The Rehearsal before watching this one; and while you’re at it, watch some of Professor Mittell’s previous pieces, where he established some of the ideas and approaches he’s developed here in elaborate and unexpected ways; specifically,<a href="https://vimeo.com/277901900"> this</a> and<a href="https://vimeo.com/142425249"> this</a>.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>This last one is unfortunately not available for viewing online, and has been making the festival round this past year – go and watch it if you get the chance. Is this a video essay? I don’t know. Here is how Tafakory describes it: “A love song that would never pass through the censors, Mast-del is about forbidden bodies and desires inside and outside post-revolution Iranian cinema.” Anyone who’s seen her previous work (and if you haven’t, you’re missing out), would recognise these themes and ideas that she has dealt with before. Here, she approaches them from a radically different aesthetic, masterfully blending clips from existing films, original footage, a scripted narrative and original score, to mesmerising and moving effect.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>“Sometimes I still picture myself.” Part of Evelyn’s fantastic Moving Poems initiative, yet a whole universe of its own. It pierces me. Everything in it. The artefacts of the video signal that devour the image, the high pitched hiss of the <span class="caps">TV</span>, the calm and sober voice that speaks of memories which sound innocuous but frighten you, and then the look on this face I recognise and which I have never seen like that.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Katie Bird’s haunting video essay and its bittersweet introduction makes us keep thinking, keep wondering, about the weight and value of labour, of film labour, scholarly labour, of what it means to hold, a camera, a child, a body, yourself, and how we can continue by letting go.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A videographic haiku, from one loving observer to the other, beautiful, personal, careful, vulnerable.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>An analysis of, as well as an act of resistance against visual capitalism going rampant. We need to fight a system that is already well ahead in co-opting, privatising, watermarking, and sealing the archives, depriving more and more people of their past, their collective memories. This video essay is an emergency call and a road map.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>“Ain’t it beautiful?” Playful. Painful. So precise. I cannot choose among the works of Dayna but I feel particularly connected to this one because I cannot separate it from all the conversations we had around it. Here is a beautiful artist and thinker driving at high speed to where video essays usually do not dare to go. Please take me with you, I will sit on the backseat.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>“Intention re-situates to the hands and fingers.” Abstract and visceral at the same time it is this experimental video essay that made me suddenly and fully understand and feel what “working with sound” could mean, how it feels to grasp what cannot be touched.

Scrolling, clicking, touching, feeling through images and associations, a flow of intertexts at the tip of your invisible finger. You better be careful with what you open next. In this one I feel seen by all these bodies, dismembered, scattered, commodified. Looking through the mirror stage and back again. And what about this little screen in my hand? Part of my body or not?</p></div>

Within 1 minute the purpose becomes clear; this woman who has very strong opinions and credentials will break down exactly what happened with the String Theory phenomenon while simultaneously stumbling through a playthrough of the vintage roguelike indie darling Binding of Isaac. A premise so absurd and hilarious (dare I say groundbreaking?) that you instantly want to watch and listen.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>I’ve yet to find a better interpreter of online culture than artist Brad Troemel, whose work satirises some of the internet’s most exasperating modes of expression. In fact, he so effectively mocks these aesthetics that his work often goes viral, with choruses of the terminally online taking it, well, literally (a recent post about the unionisation of the Taylor Swift fandom comes to mind). In addition to these posts, he creates video essays outlining his observations of online behaviour. In The Literalists, he takes a look at “millennial cultural liberalism” and the inclination to scrub content clean of any possible offence, connecting the “Satanic Panic” of the 1980s to the modern, flawed reasoning that it is morally bad to watch films with immoral characters. His essays are available exclusively on his Patreon, but it’s well worth at least a month’s subscription to binge them. You won’t regret it.</p></div>

Rather than try and explain why I picked them, I will instead attempt to describe something in each work. Here’s hoping it might inspire you to give them all a watch.</p></div>

Jasper Rigole’s short (aside from spotlighting his delightful<a href="https://iicadom.org/"> <span class="caps">IICADOM</span></a> archives, a true goldmine for home movie enthusiasts) does exactly that, while also bringing into question the spectatorship of archival footage.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Having once again decided to nominate for this poll only makers whose work I discovered this year, I realise that the five videos that I want to highlight are works I watched in the presence of their authors. Not only did their films inspire me, but I was moved by all five <span class="caps">Q&amp;A</span> sessions, for very different reasons. This may testify to a growing need for personal connection through videographic practices, in the midst of a media landscape that grows more cluttered and anonymous by the day. I also want to salute the engagement of makers who are committed to accompanying their creations in person and helping them reach an audience, even when economic or political circumstances are not favourable. My list is non hierarchical.</p></div>

There is something extremely moving about the care and tenderness with which Stéphane Gérard approaches this audiovisual document, as he edits a new short portrait of Soukaz’s late lover Hervé Couergou from the thousands of hours of footage Soukaz shot, making this testimony to the history of the «années sida» and the evolution of the gay movement accessible to a new generation of spectators, artists and activists.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A personal exploration of the complex power dynamics between a male filmer and female filmed subjects, when the camera is suddenly turned towards he whose gaze had hitherto remained unchallenged. Frund’s video essay is uncomfortable in the best sense of the word, and leaves its viewers with more questions than answers, providing a starting point for an essential conversation about gender, class and generational differences, and the ethics of documentary.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>The film is a moving and hilarious evocation of a walk through the streets of Paris on 1 May 1986, based on the filmmakers’ memories and a wide range of audiovisual archives. Images and sounds are saturated, superimposed, iridescent; facts and fantasies merge in a hallucinatory stream of real and fabricated memories, to which a final twist gives a whole new meaning.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Based on a selection of actual dreams that the filmmakers collected online, this essay explores how the figure of Vladimir Putin has crept into the psyches of Russian citizens since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Disturbing, violent, absurd, the dreams are narrated in voice over and accompanied by a visual score created with the 3D graphics program Unreal Engine, interspersed with bizarre and equally absurd archival footage of Putin. A nightmarish response to a nightmarish war, waged both on the frontline and on social media.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A portrait of Tito’s official cameraman Stevan Labudović, this feature-length essay film exhumes previously unseen archival footage from the 1961 Belgrade conference to explore the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement. As educational as it is politically sharp, the film accounts for the difficulties faced by Turajlic in working with unprocessed, barely identified archives, and offers Labudović an opportunity to share his personal and often humorous take on this turning point in the history of world politics.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Alexandre’s dissection of how algorithms are morphing our artistic tastes is insightful and biting. Although viewers may expect a video about <span class="caps">AI</span>, more time is spent on how humans are more than willing to start producing <span class="caps">AI</span>-esque content by hand in order to serve the tastes of their perceived audience. The real star of this video is the production, however. Alexandre speaks as a kaleidoscopic projection of Subway Surfer, minecraft montages, and other “sludge” is projected onto their face. As interesting as the essay’s script is, the viewer’s eye will inevitably slip to the endless stream of meaningless attention-grabbing clips – just as Alexandre intended, I imagine.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Equal parts essay and visual compendium, Face Full of Eyes’ video contains a dizzying amount of clips from hundreds of video games, all answering the same seemingly inconsequential question: how do the game’s characters handle guns with their dominant and non-dominant hands? The answer for any particular game isn’t important. The point of the video is instead that no decision is meaningless when creating art. In a created world like a video game, everything is a chance for storytelling— even the choice to depict how a left-handed person might have to reload a right-handed gun.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>The experience of watching Ahoy attempt a perfect replication of a digital illustration from 1985 somehow captures the energy of a 21st-century sculptor attempting to re-carve Michelangelo’s David. While he starts with modern Photoshop tools, the latter half of the video is a deep dive into save file formats and 40-year old display technology; a crucial realisation in the video comes from a monitor’s changing colour tone when turned to portrait orientation. The fact that all this is in service of a delightfully whimsical picture of a burger? Even better.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>In my opinion, it was an excellent year for video essays and so it was especially hard to make a selection for this poll. I used three parameters in the composition of my list: I had to choose works by different essayists from those for whom I voted in 2022; and my selection could only feature personal favourites in the field of videographic criticism, that is, a specific film, television and screen studies subset of the “video essay”. The videos also needed to be already published and freely available online, which ruled out a lot of great works for which I will undoubtedly be voting next year. I’m betting that 2024 will be an even more excellent year for video essays!</p></div>

Academic film and <span class="caps">TV</span> studies video essays have taken a very performative and embodied turn in recent years, but Mittell characteristically pushes this even further into the realm of extremely ambitious, very entertaining and deeply insightful pastiche.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Katie Bird’s virtuosic exploration of the affordances of desktop filmmaking to access the sensations of using a physical camera (and its highly original and moving audiovisual maker’s statement) made a magisterial contribution to Kevin B.

The other entries in the dossier were of excellent quality across the board, and I would particularly point to Ritika Kaushik and Brunella Tedesco-Barlocco’s great video essays for the ways in which, like Bird’s, their work points to how screen capture techniques can be harnessed to investigate very important and highly diverse screen studies research questions. </p></div>

The heart of each video lies in the wrap-up: Carlos has a knack for leaving viewers off with a perfect mix of “this sucks,” and “but I believe in us” and finally, “fuck yeah.”</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>“Physical pain does not simply resist language but actively destroys it.”</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>This thought-provoking video is an approachable look at a notoriously repulsive film (which I do not say lightly, as a squeamish viewer myself!). It proposes one lens of interpretation: what if a film like Mad God is our best chance as an audience to experience an articulation of pain through art? If pain is incommunicable through words, what sights and sounds, what deviations from expectation, can bring us into that headspace? This examination of the non-straightforward means through which cinema may operate has bent my brain, and I must recommend that you experience it for yourself.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>In the vein of Women Are Not Objects, but Objects Are Still Women, Max takes us through the special cinematic relationships between a man and his car, a man and his car who is also a woman, and a man and another man and a car which is somewhere nearby. The point: how have we learned to signify masculinity on screen? And how does John Carpenter’s Christine induce horror by perverting those signifiers? A cherry on top: this video is hilarious.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>As a bonus, I’ll also recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/_jScGztAlus?si=BJ-XXSCN_13khU7Y">their video on Hereditary</a> for its crisp, creative, and playful visual style.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>This is a tale as old as time, and yet even if you think you know this story, this video is a journey worth taking. Josh from The Nukes takes us on a personal musical tour through the many, many hidden (and not so hidden) ways that the music industry has historically catered to white sensibilities. Interesting, frustrating, and relentlessly funny – make sure to read the chapter markers for an extra dose of “this creator is having way too much fun.”</p></div>

Well, in that vein, Kendra’s channel has been a fantastic discovery for me this year. Kendra talks about architecture the way I talk about That One Funny Thing My Friend Did That One Time.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>It’s always fun letting someone take you on a journey through their random obsession, and watching all 151 Architectural Digest home tours probably enters “obsession” territory (and yet, one gets the sense that if not for the video, Kendra still would’ve done this anyway). The impression is less “I self-flagellate for content,” and more “let me give you my best takeaways from a task that you will likely never do yourself.” The difference between the two, I realised, is surprisingly important to me!             </p></div>

The essay breaks with the <span class="caps">US</span>-dominance in the study of (global) stardom by focusing on a Latin American star who becomes famous in Russia, Israel, and Central-European countries, thereby calling attention to a transnational movement that is not often addressed in star studies. The playful aesthetics of early 2000 digital culture highlights the importance of the internet in this transnational movement between “periphery” and “periphery.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Published in Feminist Media Histories, “Joséphine Baker Watches Herself” by Terri Francis shows the added value of videographic criticism to more conventional academic work. By connecting archival footage of early stage performances by Joséphine Baker to televised interviews with the iconic star in which she looks back and comments on her own star image, provides space for the Baker’s agency and voice within the narrative of her stardom in a way that could not be done so effectively (and affectively) in a written essay.</p></div>

Starting with a four-way split screen and a graphic that looks like a target finder from a rifle (or like a measuring rod), the audiovisual essay presents images of women from Iranian cinema, thereby highlighting how they are continuously scrutinised and policed, yet also how they challenge the omnipresent gaze. Using mirroring and repetition, combined by an uncanny soundtrack, the essay forces viewers (at least me) to question their preconceived notions and binary thinking. And what a surprise when the credits reveal that the footage comes from 32 films! As Maria Walsh concludes in her peer-review of the essay: “This is brave work.”</p></div>

The images come from one of the first silent fiction films, The Assassination of General Kléber (Georges Hatot, 1897), depicting the murder of the Napoleonic officer in 1800 by a Syrian student in Egypt. Abou Naddara discovered the remains of the presumed perpetrator, Soleyman El-Halebi, are kept by a French Museum, in its colonial collection and decided to take action: he wrote both a written and a videographic letter to French authorities, asking them to return the body as well as renounce the racist cliché, first printed in visual culture by the 1897 film, of the fanatic Syrian.</p></div>

Together, they also produced “Ouvrez les guillemets” (“Open the Quotes”) (for the online journal Mediapart) about political news. I wanted to cite one of their works for several reasons. One of them is that I find it very interesting how a video essay can engage with social and political criticism through mediatic images – the way Serge Daney, for instance, used to do it in a textual way in Libération. I also wanted to pay a specific homage to Usul, who for the last ten years, is, in my opinion, the most stimulating political video essayist of the French YouTube landscape and draws me to the art of montage and media criticism with his latest series “Mes chers contemporains” (“Dear Contemporaries”).</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Every time I watch a piece by Maryam Tafakory, I am overwhelmed by contradictory emotions. “chaste/unchaste,” Tafakory’s contribution to the ‘Feminist Videographic Diptych’ special issue of [in]Transition, is no exception. The use of uncanny repetition and graphic matches is both mesmerising and agitating, familiarising and defamiliarising, grounding and destabilising. And as always, I’m stunned by the quantity of films Tafakory uses to create the illusion of effortless coherent cohesion.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://deformativesoundlab.co.uk/2023/09/27/super-volume-a-tactile-art/">A Tactile Art</a> by Cormac Donnelly</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>It’s worthwhile to access Cormac Donnelly’s “second iteration of the Super Volume project” on his Deformative Sound Lab website to read about the process of making a video that is very much about process and processing. While Donnelly considers the piece a representation of a tactile art, what haunts me about the video is the juxtaposition of the ephemerality in the piece—both of the transparent layering of the participants’ hands as well as the audio track itself—with the technology at the intersection of the two: the artefact of interaction. I find this work unsettling in the very best of ways.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/872459036">Cycles of Labour: In the Metaverse, We Will Be Housewives</a> by Veronika Hanáková, Martin Tremčinský, and Jiří Anger</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>With each collaborative work, I find the dynamic duo of Veronica Hanáková and Jiří Anger increasingly enchanting. I can’t help it; I like their style. I was torn between this video and <a href="https://vimeo.com/groups/audiovisualcy/videos/828945268">their entry</a> in Ariel Avissar’s new Screen Stars Dictionary project which has some similar formal conceits, but the tongue-in-cheek nature of reframing Jeanne Dielmann’s daily routine as a “The Sim’s”-esque video game was the deciding factor. All too often, scholarly videographic criticism can feel heavy and bleak, particularly with trends in exploring thematised trauma. Here, along with Martin Tremčinský, Hanáková and Anger make a case for serious fun.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A companion piece to last year’s award-winning and frequent festival feature “Knit One, Stab Two,” here Alison Peirse shifts a feminist lens from the needle to the hook, and from the voice-over to the visualised voice, in this work on the role of crochet in horror. Peirse is developing a distinct videographic style and “Crochet” is a prime example of this aesthetic that takes the video essay (and what we think we know about horror) delightfully and impishly up a notch (or three). Note the original soundtrack created especially for the work.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Currently only available on the festival circuit, Chloé Galibert-Laîné’s most recent work is a deeply personal performance of catharsis years in the making. It is also, thankfully, very funny. The video is an inspiring whirlwind through multiple media objects and platforms, a flurry of failed and forced expressions of rage, that sticks its landing and compels us, once again, to rethink what we know about the potentials of the video essay. Details about forthcoming availability are likely to be found on their website in the future.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>I had the pleasure of seeing this video as a work in progress piece at the ‘In the Works: Makings and Unmakings of the Video Essay’ conference held at the Lucerne School of Art and Design at the beginning of November of this year. Even in an unfinished form, it was still one of my favourite videos I encountered this year, as well as one of the most timely. A desktop video in cell phone portrait mode, and perhaps even edited on one, Lacurie’s remarkable production brings together the personal and the political through the act of “doom scrolling” that involves, among other things, an episode of “Xena: Warrior Princess,” the iPhone menstruation application, text messages, online message boards, demonic imaginations of cell phone home screens, website searches, and an online tarot reading. Forthcoming and not soon enough.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>When I first saw this at the 2022 Venice Biennale, I didn’t recognise it as videographic, using physically reconstructed movie scenes for what might be called “spatial remix”. Seeing it again this year at the Hamburger Bahnhof, I could appreciate how much care it takes in reconstructing sites of Algerian cinema: not only sets from films set in Algeria, but also spaces where Algerian cinema is screened, preserved and contemplated. The video essay as artistic theme park, in the best sense possible, film history playfully resurrected.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>What an incredible video essay! This enthralling and meticulously edited piece uses a binary of chaste vs. unchaste to collapse in on itself as a gendered structure of representation in Iranian cinema. Tafakory uses repetition and juxtaposition to emphasise this undoing and mirrors clips of women in grids of four where they are (now) engaged with each other onscreen. She overlays certain clips, which seep into and onto each other as a form of touching, as if to queer the materiality of these clips as well as the newly formed relationships she has created through her editing.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A masterful and hypnotic piece that is seemingly edited on a smartphone that simultaneously demonstrates the source materials and inspiration for the work, while showing the methods and thinking of its construction. Lacurie takes us on an expansive menstruation journey that is personal and political—navigating apps, memes, video clips, and a tarot card reading through the analysis of a fatal penetrative wound on Xena Warrior Princess’s body. A mesmerising video essay from, In the Works: Makings and Unmakings of the Video Essay, Lucerne School of Art and Design, Switzerland. See Lacurie’s other work: https://vimeo.com/lacurieo</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A video essay with an ending you can dance to, I Would Like to Rage is smart, tender, and funny. Galibert-Laîné’s thorough and thoughtful practice is fully on display as they take us through various machinations of online and mediatised rage, its performativity, expression, and ownership, and how they experience or rather, attempt to experience rage authentically. A triumph of intelligent vulnerability expressed through an assemblage of self-reflection, video clips, memes, gifs, and Leslie Knope homages, this endearing delight of a video essay is surely coming to a film festival near you.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/838267891">Kiss me softly | crackly | sharply</a> by Lucy Fife Donaldson</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>An impeccable experimental video essay that exaggerates and emphasises the uncanny through foley and feminist intervention. Fife Donaldson aptly mixes and amplifies the sharp edges of <span class="caps">ASMR</span> sound artist Julie Rose Bower’s work by replacing the soundtrack for the knife scene in Kiss Me Deadly. Switchblades pop and fist punches snap and crack onscreen through Fife Donaldson’s use of this unique collection of sound, and her use of visual repetition and slow motion. I am particularly drawn to how she lingers on sound during a slow motion shot of the would-be attacker’s descent to the ground as he slides down a wall after the attempted knife fight.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A gong repeatedly sounds as ‘The End’ title text from a variety of films are shown onscreen in several languages. We hear a tapping—a soft clicking that is perhaps his keyboard, our viewership guided by his hand. The way that Binotto has arranged these endings and silenced their corresponding soundtracks are filled with loss as they each mark an ending to a specific film as well as the end of his incredible <a href="https://transferences.org/videoessays/practices-of-viewing/">Practices of Viewing series</a>. Binotto cites Roland Barthes while seemingly articulating his own work ethic: “writing as absolute brings with it a particular existential movement: the drive to finish the work in order to start again”. I can’t wait to see what comes next.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Using Evelyn Kreutzer’s Moving Poems prompt that asks makers to pair a poem with a media object, moving poems: a raisin in the sun (1961) is a poignant and poetic work that capitalises on affecting performances from the 1961 film adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun. De Jesús engages Langston Hughes’s short poem Harlem in onscreen text while expertly and artfully using opacity, repetition, movement, dialogue, and match cuts to sound in this stunning and layered poetic video essay.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A sublime supercut of every time the title character of Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles turns on and off the lights. Noall jumpcuts us through each of the rooms of this film and the quiet bland domesticity of house and sex work with this simple task. Only fans of this iconic film will recognise the importance of Noall’s final shot where Jeanne turns off the light of the kitchen while firmly grasping her silver scissors and shutting the door behind her with a thud.</p></div>

In my own video essay work, Be Kind Rewind is one of my biggest inspirations. Every video amazes me with the sheer knowledge and passion for film on display.

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>At the edge of the word lies silence, hesitation. On the other side of colour, there are bright colours, gray, black and white. This is a film that sits on the other side of the mirror and takes us through the tense and enigmatic reverse side of classic cinema. In Aguilar’s audiovisual essay, everything floats, expectantly, waiting to happen, inaugurating a new order, like a tense relationship between day and night, between the negative and the positive of a film stock.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>For each contact, each touch there is a split “I”, a network of sensation. Mirjam Leutwiler’s short audiovisual essay is not only interpreting Michel Serre’s text “The Five Senses. A Philosophy of Mingled Bodies”, but also telling us how that network about touching and feeling is underway in the cinematic phenomenology.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Kinoapparatum Remade is not only an homage to Vertov, Kaufman and Svilova’s seminal film Man with a Movie Camera. And also not only a reflection on Manovich’s ideas on the film regarding new media. It is all of this but it is also a collective collaborative effort in which we can see that recreation it also followed by actualisation, complementation and creative choices based on movement and form. And these particular choices of the “collective with the moving images” tells us that it is not only a question of past versus incoming future when we look at 1929’s masterpiece.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Digravio’s original audiovisual essay may work against the idea of perfection and neatness as a possible disguised style. But it is also an exposition of the work involved in the audiovisual essay. In this sense, it enters a loop, a mise-en-abîme where a “meta worker” develops a similar “meta mirror” to better highlight the nature of what is involved when reworking the images and sounds of a film. </p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>There has been so much exciting work to learn from in 2023 that I found it near-impossible to make this selection, even limiting myself (as I have) to ‘scholarly’ video essays. Let me name some makers in addition to the many mentioned below that have impacted my understanding of the practice this year: Ariane Hudelet, Cormac Donnelly, Dayna McLeod, Irina Trocan, Jemma Saunders, John Gibbs, Kevin Ferguson, Liz Greene, Maria Hofmann, Maud Ceuterick, Oswald Iten, Richard Misek, Susan Harewood… My point with this list, which could have been indefinitely extended, is that investigating the possibilities of the video essay is a collective endeavour. Brian Eno has a notion of collective ‘scenius’ (as opposed to individual ‘genius’) which refers to “the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene”: it’s this boisterous collective intelligence that I think we’re witnessing with the explosion of the video essay. Can it last? I do worry that the period of expansion, exploration and experimentation will exhaust itself, and that a single preferred mode of audiovisual rhetoric will be asserted or be insisted upon by the journals. I’m relieved this hasn’t happened yet, not in 2023 at any rate. And so my selection (which could easily have been several further sets of seven videos) is intended to indicate some of the striking variety, as well as the quality, of the work being done.<br/>

<a href="https://vimeo.com/827670996">Memories of It</a> by Kathleen Loock<br/>
<br/>
‘Memories of It’ mixes film, trailer and documentary footage with personal reflection and interview in order to tease out Kathleen Loock’s traumatic memory of watching (and fast-forwarding) the 1990 adaptation of It on <span class="caps">VHS</span> as a child. She links this memory with the condition of the Wendekinder, children like her of the former <span class="caps">GDR</span> forced to cope with a new world after German reunification. Does Kathleen over-sociologise her act of retrospectatorship by invoking shared generational experience? Is the video an attempt to contain as well as explain the threat of traumatic eruption? I’ll just have to watch ‘it’ again…<br/>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Thomas Pynchon’s Vineland is my favourite novel and one joy of my 2023 was encountering Peter Coviello’s Vineland Reread, a book that mixes literary criticism, cultural theory and autobiography to evoke the presence of Vineland in Coviello’s life and teaching. Drew Morton’s account of re-viewing and teaching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind at intervals since that film’s release is a similarly rich and joyful intellectual experience – Drew even shares some hard-earned lessons in love. (I recommend comparing the earlier version of the video linked in the creator statement, to see how an adept maker engages with challenging peer review.)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/723431318">Desktop Documentary</a> by Johannes Binotto</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Johannes Binotto’s literally/ironically titled ‘Desktop Documentary’ is expressly a “call to clutter”. As such, it makes me terribly anxious. But this is a brilliantly conceived and engagingly performed piece of explicatory and programmatic rhetoric that draws on YouTube how-to videos even as it nods to the opening of Cléo de 5 à 7. I am happy to grant Binotto’s fiction that his desk has not been curated because I am persuaded by his account of the desktop as recalcitrant technology. And I am especially seduced by his call for productive accident and a-rational research methods that look back to surrealism.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>True Enough might seem a jeu d’esprit compared to Chloé Galibert-Laîné’s longer video essays. But even as it draws on the functional aesthetic of the karaoke video, this adaptation of a text by Will Webb, made for Ariel Avissar and Evelyn Kreutzer’s Once upon A Screen project, is a work of great refinement. Galibert-Laîné creates a “fictional offscreen space” with beautifully composed filmed footage enlivened by dancing light from an unseen television. The cheerful font and sung accompaniment extend the possibilities of onscreen text and voiceover. As an added bonus (or intrinsic moment), it contains the best Simpsons allusion ever.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste">chaste/unchaste</a> by Maryam Tafakory</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>This has been a vintage year for multiscreen. Like the videos by Mittell and Arlander discussed below, Colleen Laird’s Eye-Camera-Ninagawa and Adam Cook’s A Cinema of Bodily Sense deploy multiscreen in powerful but contrasting ways. Maryam Tafakory uses it differently again in ‘chaste/unchaste’. The video is a supercut of female faces (plus one big cat and a gas hob) made from thirty-two Iranian films. It stages its imagining of queer desire as a progression from multiscreen to single screen to superimposition. ‘chaste/unchaste’ is a condensed masterclass in how argument can be made in formal terms without the aid of voiceover.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>To celebrate its twentieth anniversary, the Danish film journal 16:9 has been publishing 169-second video essays in a series that features makers like Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin, Jaap Kooijman, Catherine Grant, and Barbara Zecchi, with two impressive videos by my Aarhus colleague Mathias Bonde Korsgaard. My favourite is Jason Mittell’s cheeky afterthought to his videographic project on Breaking Bad (it traces Walter White’s story arc through his hairstyles). I like how the application of strict but ludic formal parameters, which Mittell derives from the journal name and video duration, generate a cryptic visual tapestry of the entire series.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://screenworks.org.uk/archive/volume-13-1/revisiting-the-aspen-tree">Revisiting the Aspen Tree</a> by Annette Arlander</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Between 2002 and 2014, artist Annette Arlander recorded weekly visits to locations on Harakka Island near Helsinki in a series of videos. In Revisiting the Aspen Tree, she returns to one such site and embeds those videos in the video document of the more recent visit. Differently from Mittell’s Trimming Time, Arlander uses parameters to dictate a practice that is physical, repetitive and durational. But it reminds me of Will DiGravio’s Rio Bravo project, and like DiGravio’s four-hour Against Polish, it suggests the value of an ‘ambient’ scholarship, in which iterative academic labour is presented in something like real time.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>My selections focus on creators who are pushing the critical boundaries of the video essay format. In particular, these are creators who both utilise critical theory, social theory, and philosophy while also producing videos that are entertaining and accessible. They also make the types of videos that leave you feeling like more questions have been opened than answered. Which, especially on YouTube, is an increasingly rare thing.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>This video might be Nicholas’s magnum opus, and it feels more like a digital documentary than it does a traditional video essay with a runtime of almost two hours. But he earns every minute of the video by not only exploring the growing phenomenon of digital grifters, but by showing how the logic of grifters exists in an ongoing dialectical relationship with the larger economic structures in our world. In this way he arrives at the logical core of the modern digital grifter, and shows how this same logic is at the heart of much of modern culture. He balances this out by also exploring the psychological factors that have made grifter scams and content so popular. Nicholas also deserves credit for working a level of theatricality into this video (and all of his videos) that’s visually engaging without being distracting. In a world of sad ex-grad students making videos about capitalism ruining our world, Nicholas is the relatable and entertaining lad that takes you just as deep without any performative nihilism.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>2023 was a banner year for content made by reactionary young men utilising various philosophical and political ideas to justify a sense of growing alienation. While it’s easy to dismiss this contingent of creators completely, the harder task is to engage with these trends, openly interrogating their ideological core. And this video does an exemplary job at this task, taking red pill philosophy to task, and in the process, exposing how it offers a shallow simulacrum of actual philosophical responses to complex social problems. The video acknowledges the alienating cultural conditions that produce the “manosphere” while exposing the illogical core at the heart of these ideas. In doing so, Then <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Now has created a video that pushes the viewer to not simply dismiss the modern reactionary, but to understand the logic of this movement, and see how this manner of thinking is more common than we might realise. Ultimately, it’s a video that skillfully uses seemingly esoteric and academic ideas to re-frame the contemporary crisis of masculinity while showing us all why we should care.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhlSgE1dkDc">the parasite class is killing us.</a> by Alice Capelle<br/>
<br/>
In this video, Alice Capelle uses the logic of vampire capitalism to show how the modern digital economy increasingly depends on acts of parasitism. She shows how the type of parasitic class relationships exemplified in Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite is replicated in digital spaces, and in particular, among self-styled business gurus using YouTube videos as a way to repeat the logic of class exploitation in the guise of self-help and business advice. Like most of Capelle’s work, this video utilises her ability to synthesise a French brand of critical social theory with an English-language based digital cultural space. This video feels like a sort of ethnography of the contemporary digital parasite, one that both exposes the exploitative core of their content, while hopefully encouraging us to undermine this logic however we can.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>This item is from the journal I edit. I chose it from our 2023 video articles because of how it uses a formally simple concept to stage a deep dive into a range of scholarly projects. This is a co-authored video article sharing the research of five academics, who not only speak to the camera about their work but also interact physically with various objects on a sparse kind of set. It is elegantly produced and designed to examine “the personal and intellectual contexts (peri) surrounding academics and their biographies (bio) through audio-visual representation (photy).”</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>This film is technically from 2022 (I don’t know which month), but since this is my first Sight and Sound poll, I have decided to include it. As far as I can tell, it has primarily been screened in 2023. In the film, scholar Ariella Aïsha Azoulay explores the complex history of colonialism between Algeria and Israel, with an emphasis on the gradual erasure of the important figure of the Arab Jew. Azoulay manages to put this history in the broader context of European colonialism in Africa and to interrogate the ongoing practices of colonial museums, all through the simple action of touching and talking about a wide array of books, photographs, mezuzot, and other objects on her desk. When I first saw this film, I immediately felt that it brings an extraordinary depth and power to the concept of the “desktop documentary.”</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Hold On, This Matilda Musical Snapping was a TikTok / Instagram trend in which a scene of dynamic choreography from the movie version of the musical Matilda is overlaid by various alternative musical tracks. While putting forward a 25-second social media remix as one of the best video essays of the year is certainly pushing the limits of the form, all the key elements are there: a creative and incisive juxtaposition of a video track with a distinct audio track is contextualised by the critical commentary of a textual annotation. The version I have chosen to link uses @wonder_kidd’s remix of Beyonce’s ‘Cuff It’, a choice that (as many of the Instagram commenters noted) effectively brings out the black cultural roots of Ellen Kane’s choreography, in sharp relief against the massively predominant whiteness of the British schoolchildren who perform it. In just a few seconds, this remix gives us both a snapping new version of Matilda and a cultural critique of how black dance knowledges circulate in predominantly white cultural fields.</p></div>

Each video is a deep dive on the cultural history of how the food is used and why, the basics of the culinary science behind it, and Chlebowski doing several taste tests and then giving recommendations at varying price points. While some of his conclusions are down to personal preference, his videos are nevertheless fascinating and done without judgement or pretension. I’d consider them a must-watch for new home cooks or those looking for a great example of engaging educational content that doesn’t condescend.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>This installation work surveys the history of Iran over several decades, focusing on oil extraction by the foreign company soon to be known as British Petroleum, through a technique called reflection seismography. The challenge, of course, as postcolonial scholarship taught us, is to look beyond the audiovisual self-representation of the company – and the artist accomplishes this extraordinarily well. A voiceover accompanies a collage/montage documenting industrial processes, while the collage in itself operates on the images – which sometimes look like spectral cutouts – workers disconnected from the background, initially black, that slowly takes shape behind them), while at other times these images show their age (for instance, when 1930s maps are juxtaposed with recent <span class="caps">CGI</span>).</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Films about revolutions often – and quite paradoxically – treat the event like a solidly contained point on the historical axis, with a beginning and an end, missing exactly their transformative potential and their collective character. One way to avoid this is to resort to the not-entirely-manipulable archives from the depicted era (and not just in short clips to lend the veneer of truth to fictional reenactments), and Between Revolutions is a pretty convincing demonstration of this strategy. Maria and Zahra are fictional med students from Romania and Iran, trying to figure out life amid social turmoil – but the footage, poems and songs that illustrate their journey existed in the world long before the making of this film, and even when made with obvious artistic or educational intent (not to mention elaborate choreography!), these reworked materials contain some trace or emotional truth of their times.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Bill Morrison is known to be interested in film only when it is analogue and beautifully degraded, and in this respect the <span class="caps">CCTV</span>/bodycam-sourced Incident is a long distance from <a href="https://vimeo.com/734548266">Buried News</a>. The killing of Harith Augustus by the Chicago police was previously examined by Forensic Architecture to persuasively oppose the authorities’ version of the event, but Morrison and Jamie Kalven at the Invisible Institute set out to do something else. The 30-minute film, often showing in split-screen multiple angles and parallel events, only tracks a short span of time, although 1) it seems dispiritingly endless and 2) it already anticipates the community’s reaction to seeing yet another African American killed, while the policemen, in an onlooker’s phrasing, “get their story straight”. Augustus’s lifeless body is present in the frame for a long stretch of the runtime, contrary to the <span class="caps">CPD</span>’s attempt to erase the “accident” from memory, while the eloquent rage of everyone in the community seems tragically rehearsed in similar prior events. The victim’s neighbours don’t get to express solidarity, but the colleagues of the policemen who fired the gun can, and do, help erase criminal guilt.</p></div>

Luckily, well-informed critiques, spanning many decades of <span class="caps">US</span> films, and listing all the problematic tropes implicit in the “makeover” are also competing for our attention. I can only hope that more young spectators see “The Makeover Movie”, where Sue Ding conjures a multiracial telephone slumber party with her girlfriends to understand how these films taught them “not only how to be a woman, but also how to be American”. Teen classics provide most material, but a handful of musicals plus Desplechin’s A Christmas Tale and Vertigo also fit the bill.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>The latest film by James N. Kienitz Wilkins is an intriguing and exhausting audio play voiced by the director, who plays the four main characters in a court inquiry about film memories, film still photographers, Kodak as a pharmaceutical enterprise, the negative aura of Tom Hanks, boom operators, and the elusiveness of Hollywood as a cultural agent. All of this is put together with a seemingly random selection of film stills. As usual, in Kienitz Wilkins’ work, discourse is moving and images are ecstatic.</p></div>

Edited as a frantic accumulation of non-images, we expect the worst and suffer the anticipation of immoral, violent, or graphic images. Without the images themselves, we are left with an essay on morality and sensibility as they evolve through time and shape the way we see the world around us and ourselves.</p></div>

A good recap doesn’t just communicate plot, but also the point of the essay; this does both. Excellent pacing and vocal delivery communicates the tone of the map, and becomes a jumping off point for an analysis of horror in gaming / the oft-discussed topic of liminal spaces.

DeLisio’s commentary includes text elements that are ingeniously expressed in a similar visual language to the film’s (faded, grainy, blurry). As commenter Max Tohline puts it, “not under the knife of Scarry, but in coequal conversation with Scarry”.</p></div>

Talk about ‘embodied practice’: hard for me to imagine a more clear example than Alexandre projecting the edited video text onto their own body for the entirety of this video. An interruption a few minutes in from YouTube’s algorithm –a split-screen beer advert no less– just added to the gag on my viewing. And throughout the to-camera presentation, I found my eye drawn off to the Minecraft parkour constantly, in a clever proving of Alexandre’s argument. Behind the overstimulating presentation, Alexandre’s analysis offers an insightful categorisation of a media type inexplicable on the surface but ever-present in the developing digital landscape.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>There’s a fine line between a shitpost and a videographic work; ironically, the more academic end of video essays (with their lack of in-video explanation due to abstract support, and leaning towards supercuts and split-screens) are more like this than popular YouTube works. Seinpeaks illustrates the fine line beautifully. It’s a long-running project mashing up Twin Peaks and Seinfeld (with guest appearances from other stalwart shows like Always Sunny and Friends). These two shows aired simultaneously and their shared visual language provides a jumping-off point for a surprising collab that draws out the humour in Twin Peaks and the absurdism in Seinfeld.</p></div>

The camera eye acts as a catalyst for encounters, while questioning the human gestures that shape materials and territories.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Svanik Surve has been making video essays steadily for a few years now, but expanded his output in 2023 when he created two new YouTube channels. This year, his work explored Indian culture, international art cinema, and philosophy. His creative, intelligent, and funny videos deserve a much larger audience.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@framemygaze">framemygaze</a> (nominated by Queline Meadows)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>In my eyes, there is nobody more immersed in the YouTube media and culture video essay landscape than framemygaze, and I say that as someone who runs a Discord server for video essay creators! I’ve found her in the comment sections of countless videos writing detailed notes that reflect her care and close attention to everything she watches. Framemygaze has only released one video so far, but if her deep understanding of the video essay community is any indication, there will be many more great videos in the future.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AliceCappelle">Alice Cappelle</a> (nominated by Michael <span class="caps">O’N</span>eill Burns)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Alice’s videos offer an intriguing perspective at the borders of Francophile and Anglophile culture. She’s a French creator making videos in English, often about topics and phenomena specific to English language digital spaces and culture. This perspective allows her to use the critical force of a French leftist theorist to tackle seemingly vapid and conceptually empty trends and practices. At other times, she’s able to translate the specificity of the French political moment to a broader audience in a way that’s far more accessible than standard news coverage.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SkipIntroYT">Jackson Maher </a>(nominated by Michael <span class="caps">O’N</span>eill Burns)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Jackson is an already accomplished editor who in recent years has put himself in front of the camera to create video essays that lure viewers in with analysis of popular media properties, but uses this as the occasion to expose deeper cultural ideologies buried within pop culture. His series of videos on Copaganda does a masterful job at showing us how the logic of policing has infected so much of our culture, down to popular children’s programme Paw Patrol. But maybe most impressively, Jackson does all this while being relatable and curious, never making the viewer feel judged but instead inviting us to dig deeper alongside him.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/-aRSLSAzbI8?si=HzPnuI05Lo8CfK7r">Lara Isobel Callaghan</a> (nominated by Will Webb)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>Lara is a new face on the video-essay scene, with a number of commissions across Little White Lies and the <span class="caps">BFI</span>. Although the commissioned work is excellent, I’m highlighting this video from the Essay Library collab, When Essay Met Library, due to its formal inventiveness and cheeky sense of humour. Using Hindi film Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan as a jumping off point, Lara examines Shakespeare’s influence on the rom-com genre through the lens of a 1980s infomercial. William Shakespeare’s Course of True Love: available now!</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://www.mediapolisjournal.com/2023/09/screen-journeys/">Jemma Saunders</a> (nominated by Will Webb)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>A doctoral researcher at the University of Birmingham, Jemma’s particular focus on sense of place (and Birmingham especially) comes to the fore in this fascinating essay examining automotive representations of the city. Other works in this vein include <a href="https://vimeo.com/787317723">Reaching Out Remotely</a>, covering <span class="caps">UK</span> soap Doctors’ covid episode, made all the more poignant by its cancellation this year.</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p><a href="https://www.carlymattox.com/">Carly Mattox</a> (nominated by Adam Woodward)</p></div>

<div class="Text__Outer-sc-1acyvkb-0 iESPyA text_block"><p>I met Carly in late 2022 when I gave a talk to the second year students at <span class="caps">NFTS</span>. She reached out to me earlier this year and has since contributed a handful of videos to the <span class="caps">LWL</span>ies YouTube channel.</p></div>

Its primary purposes are to mark notable works and keep track of the various schools of thought concerning what video essays can or should be, and how they can communicate to a range of&nbsp;audiences.</p>\n\n<p>The poll was conducted with the assistance of 48 voters from 17 countries, including academics, critics, online creators and festival curators. Together, their 260 nominations include 181 distinct titles. Given the scope and abundance of recent video essays, even an extensive poll can only provide a cross-section of the topics, forms and rhetoric of their contemporary practice – a limitation many voters noted in their submissions. Of the nominated works, 47% were created by male video essayists, 39% by female, with several from non-binary creators and mixed teams. Around two-thirds feature voiceover, with the majority presented in English, although 14 languages feature in the overall&nbsp;poll.</p>\n\n<p>The nominations saw a relatively equal split between essays created for YouTube and those created for academic research, with 50 YouTube and 47 academic videos (or entire series). Publicly available videos’ viewership varies broadly, from 9.5 million views (for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5wAo54DHDY0?si=64cLsJYtzrCSlIXg\">MyHouse.wad</a>) to the low double digits; participants were keen to highlight new and underseen works as well as celebrating the achievements of established creators. Festival films or installation pieces also proved popular, with 53 arthouse shorts, features and documentaries nominated. Also present, although in a smaller proportion, were self-published Vimeo works or collaborative projects unaffiliated with a specific institution. However, within the yearly <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span> poll for video essays, there seems to be a slight decline both in independently produced and published Vimeo content, and in video output by cinephile magazines, while the academic sector is slowly but constantly&nbsp;expanding.</p>\n\n<p>The average runtime was 27 minutes, with most around the 15 minute mark – although a few marathon nominations like Will DiGravio’s <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/841294355\">Against Polish</a> and Adam Curtis’ <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0d3hwl1/russia-19851999-traumazone\">TraumaZone</a> (three and seven hours respectively) stick out. Three videos were one minute long or&nbsp;shorter.</p>\n\n<p>Leading the nominations, Maryam Tafakory and Johannes Binotto tie for 10 nominations, with Tafakory’s split-screen work <a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste\">chaste/unchaste</a> and Binotto’s <a href=\"https://blog.hslu.ch/videoessay/johannes-binotto-practices-of-viewing-description/\">Practices</a> <a href=\"https://blog.hslu.ch/videoessay/johannes-binotto-practices-of-viewing-color/\">of</a> <a href=\"https://blog.hslu.ch/videoessay/practices-viewing-distance/\">Viewing</a> series coming out on top. <a href=\"https://www.ahistoryoftheworldaccordingtogettyimages.com/\">A History of the World According to Getty Images</a> by Richard Misek received nine nominations, the most for a single work. Returning essayists of note include Chloé Galibert-Laîné, Barbara Zecchi and Ariel Avissar, while new entrants with multiple nominations include Occitane Lacurie (three noms for Xena’s Body: A Menstrual Auto-Investigation Using an iPhone) and James DeLisio (four nominations for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wV8BnxuPF2Y?si=WFcpR127IAGAFaEW\">Cinema in Pain: Decoding “Mad God”</a>).</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that some videos appear in consecutive polls: among them, Misek’s History of the World According to Getty Images and Galibert-Laîné’s <a href=\"https://www.chloegalibertlaine.com/geomarkr\">GeoMarkr</a> are now available online, while in <a href=\"/sight-and-sound/polls/best-video-essays-2022\">the 2022 poll</a> they were occasionally mentioned, but less widely seen. It is often the case that videos travel in festivals or are viewed in conferences and among peers before being made public. While the current poll has several dozen videos to which we cannot presently direct our readers, we hope that in the near future many will be similarly available with unrestricted&nbsp;access.</p>\n\n<p>Videographic collaborations make up a number of nominations in this years’ list. <a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-94-2023\">Once upon a Screen: Vol. 2</a>, edited by Avissar and Evelyn Kreutzer, returns with two nominations for its second instalment. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/9576546\">Moving Poems</a>, also curated by Kreutzer, received five nominations, chiefly for Desiree de Jesus’ a raisin in the sun. And the <a href=\"https://www.16-9.dk/kategori/media/\">169 Seconds</a> series, commissioned by Danish journal 16:9 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, received three nominations, including returning essayists Catherine Grant and Jason Mittell. Independent videographic community <a href=\"https://theessaylibrary.com/\">The Essay Library</a> also features with one nomination for Lara Callaghan’s contribution to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzHhdsb5LkA\">When Essay Met Library</a> collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>A number of essays were published through new academic journals, including Zeitschrift für Medienwissenschaft with five videos nominated; other new entrants include Teknokultura and Feminist Media Histories. [in]Transition, Tecmerin and <span class=\"caps\">NECSUS</span> are by now certified in making the works they publish visible among videographic&nbsp;researchers.</p>\n\n<p>Independent streaming service <a href=\"https://nebula.tv/\">Nebula</a> has continued to grow its base of creators, many of whom are video essayists. Out of 50 unique YouTube videos, seven were also published on Nebula. Three of these were directly cross-posted, another three were Nebula First (published earlier than YouTube), and one nomination – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIwwJGhbDb8\">We Must Destroy What the Bomb Cannot</a> by Big Joel – was a Nebula Plus video, meaning it includes extra content beyond what is available on YouTube. Lily Alexandre’s Nebula-first essay <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OuaDbu_VBLY?si=YMVVLrvetpI1Dmtx\">Everything Is Sludge: Art in the Post-Human Era</a> received three nods, bringing the total number of Nebula nominations up to&nbsp;nine.</p>\n\n<p>Billed as a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/streaming/news/nebula-ceo-dave-wiskus-interview-1235782591/\">creator-first streaming service</a>, Nebula aims to give its creators the freedom that they cannot find on YouTube. Many video essayists have joined Nebula after finding their work coming up against YouTube’s advertiser-friendly guidelines, restricting the discussion of mature topics. In February 2023, Maggie Mae Fish launched her series <a href=\"https://nebula.tv/unrated\">Unrated</a> exploring sexuality in film, and Broey Deschanel followed suit in November with the <a href=\"https://nebula.tv/taboo\">Taboo on Screen</a> series. There’s an oft-noted divide between ‘Vimeo-style’ essays –&nbsp;with their more academic leaning and longer clip length – and YouTube essays – with their quick cuts and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tonyszhou/postmortem-1b338537fabc\">careful stepping around automatic copyright claims</a>. This gap may be quickly closing, although whether a Nebula style will arise remains to be&nbsp;seen.</p>\n\n<p>Although content creators can make money through AdSense and sponsorships on YouTube, many turn to community donations and subscriptions to fund their work. Forty-one of the nominated YouTube works included a link to Patreon, Ko-fi or PayPal in the video description. One nominated video, Brad Troemel’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sXYV-VUPneA?si=NOAXouLQBjMVTWGj\">The Literalists</a>, is available exclusively on Patreon, with only a trailer uploaded to&nbsp;YouTube.</p>\n\n<p>Vimeo essayists have also encountered in greater force the problems that have plagued YouTube essayists for years. Formerly a safe haven for video essays containing copyrighted materials, Vimeo has enacted a slew of copyright claims, viewing restrictions and takedowns on well-known video essays in recent months. This brings to mind Fandor’s 2016/2017 removal of multiple video essays from their channels in response to the threat of copyright claims, ringing alarm bells about the mixed potential of the Internet as an archive for videographic work. The long-running <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/8660446\"><span class=\"caps\">TV</span> Dictionary</a> project is just one example with multiple claims, despite its clear origin in academic research&nbsp;practice.</p>\n\n<p>Nostalgia and memory, pop culture and cinephilia – sometimes mixed together –&nbsp;loom large in this year’s list, due in part to some popular academic series including <a href=\"https://indyvinyl.gla.ac.uk/indy-vinyl-for-the-masses/\">Indy Vinyl for the Masses</a> (curated by Ian Garwood) and the <a href=\"https://tecmerin.uc3m.es/project/screen-stars-dictionary/?lang=en\">Screen Stars Dictionary</a> (curated by Tecmerin and Ariel Avissar). Gender as spectacle makes its appearance in several videos, from the mainstream end of the spectrum (max teeth’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlu-Ffdxocc&amp;ab_channel=maxteeth\">The Man/Car Gender Binary in John Carpenter’s Christine</a>) to critical discussions of star personae, cinema’s archetypal female protagonists as well as filmmaking/media practices (Morgane Frund’s short films, among other titles), to direct references to Laura Mulvey and Judith Butler at the other&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n<p>As with all other areas of discourse this year, <span class=\"caps\">AI</span> featured in multiple videos, usually more as a thematic concern than as a videographic tool (although text-to-speech and some generative techniques feature in the list). Futurism more generally, whether dystopian or utopian, was a common theme in the YouTube&nbsp;nominations.</p>\n\n<p>Interrogation of the video essay form itself continues to stimulate discussion within the field, including the drawing to a close of Johannes Binotto’s popular Practices of Viewing series. While this self-reflexivity was <a href=\"/sight-and-sound/polls/best-video-essays-2021\">first noted in the 2021 poll</a>, it was seen more on YouTube in 2023, with videos ranging from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/t41M_E7BvDo?si=_-BKe5YuveA7jveS\">assessing the state of the video essay landscape</a> to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sEEBKbCvDJE?si=caP9Ha_aIIOjHUZ8\">dispensing advice about how to be a successful video essayist</a>. Harris Michael Brewis, better known as hbomberguy, released a nearly four-hour <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yDp3cB5fHXQ?si=aR6n5X0sHj65SkWp\">exposé of plagiarism on YouTube</a> with a particular focus on video essays. The video passed two million views within 24 hours of its&nbsp;publication.</p>\n\n<p>While there are certainly great videos that remained unmentioned even with such dedicated teamwork on behalf of all voters, the present survey should be a solid starting point (and, in a few years’ time, a reminder) of the state of video essays in 2023. Thank you to everyone who&nbsp;participated.</p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"voters\">Full list of&nbsp;voters</a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#anger\">Jiří&nbsp;Anger</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#avissar\">Ariel&nbsp;Avissar</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#binotto\">Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#brubaker\">Philip Józef&nbsp;Brubaker</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#carvajal\">Nelson&nbsp;Carvajal</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#chinapen\">Ben&nbsp;Chinapen</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#custodio\">Isabel&nbsp;Custodio</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#digravio\">Will&nbsp;DiGravio</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#dima\">Flavia&nbsp;Dima</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#galibert\">Chloé&nbsp;Galibert-Laîné</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#geller\">Jacob&nbsp;Geller</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#genevicius\">Tomas&nbsp;Genevičius</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#gibbs\">John&nbsp;Gibbs</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#gills\">Libertad&nbsp;Gills</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#grant\">Catherine&nbsp;Grant</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#hofmann\">Maria&nbsp;Hofmann</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#iten\">Oswald&nbsp;Iten</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#jeanneret\">Delphine&nbsp;Jeanneret</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#jude\">Radu&nbsp;Jude</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#kern\">Sam&nbsp;Kern</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#kiss\">Miklós&nbsp;Kiss</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#kooijman\">Jaap&nbsp;Kooijman</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#kreutzer\">Evelyn&nbsp;Kreutzer</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#lacurie\">Occitane&nbsp;Lacurie</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#laird\">Colleen&nbsp;Laird</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#lee\">Kevin B.&nbsp;Lee</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#martin\">Adrian&nbsp;Martin</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#mcilwraith\">Daniel&nbsp;Mcilwraith</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#mcleod\">Dayna&nbsp;McLeod</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#meadows\">Queline&nbsp;Meadows</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#natalio\">Carlos&nbsp;Natálio</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#ogara\">Clare <span class=\"caps\">O’G</span>ara</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#oleary\">Alan <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#burns\">Michael <span class=\"caps\">O’N</span>eill&nbsp;Burns</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#ross\">Julian&nbsp;Ross</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#hinojosa\">José Sarmiento&nbsp;Hinojosa</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#saunders\">Jemma&nbsp;Saunders</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#schindel\">Dan&nbsp;Schindel</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#spatz\">Ben&nbsp;Spatz</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#strucci\">Shannon&nbsp;Strucci</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#tafoya\">Scout&nbsp;Tafoya</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#tohline\">Max&nbsp;Tohline</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#trocan\">Irina&nbsp;Trocan</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#vanau\">Ilinca&nbsp;Vânău</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#lisboa\">Ricardo Vieira&nbsp;Lisboa</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#webb\">Will&nbsp;Webb</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#woodward\">Adam&nbsp;Woodward</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#zecchi\">Barbara&nbsp;Zecchi</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>All the&nbsp;votes</h2>\n\n<h3><a name=\"anger\">Jiří&nbsp;Anger</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://qmul.academia.edu/JiriAnger\">Film theorist, curator, and video essayist</a>, Queen Mary University of London and Národní filmový&nbsp;archiv</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/history-world-according-getty-images\">A History of the World According to Getty Images</a> by Richard&nbsp;Misek</p>\n\n<p>A timely meditation on how even public domain images ‘we all know’ can become unattainable when they find themselves in the thrall of commercial archives and data banks.

By jumping between the indistinct traces of <span class=\"caps\">CLODO</span>, a terrorist group that bombed computer companies in 1980s France, it denies the pretension that the desktop interface is there ‘for us’ to make content readily available and uncovers the fundamental lack and self-destructivity of contemporary visual&nbsp;regimes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtAa7EGFAHk\">Twisties!</a> by Alice&nbsp;Lenay</p>\n\n<p>A fascinating extension of the videographic impulse into a live performance.

It was made under the mentorship of Catherine Grant, as part of a wonderful videographic symposium held in Hanover late last year, where I first got to see it — and was published earlier this year in the ZfM blog Videography, which followed that symposium. Don’t miss it — and also check out her shorter, lovely video, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/866170709\">Wes Anderson’s Trains</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zfmedienwissenschaft.de/en/online/videography-blog/accented-sound-of-camp\">The Accented Sound of Camp</a> by Barbara&nbsp;Zecchi</p>\n\n<p>In another video first presented at the Hanover conference and published this year on the ZfM blog, Zecchi offers a 4-part exploration of the use of Italian accents in Hollywood films. Starting from House of Gucci, it examines various screen representations of Italians and Italian Americans and the political and ideological dimensions of the accented voice (following Zecchi’s<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/680718777\"> previous work</a> on the subject). It is insightful, entertaining and highly inventive, experimenting with a diverse range of videographic techniques and forms of&nbsp;voiceover.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/men-shouting-history-7-episodes\">Men Shouting: A History in 7 Episodes</a> by Alan <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary</p>\n\n<p>One of the explicit inspirations for Zecchi’s video above, <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary’s is a tour de force of parametric criticism, or what he calls a form of “cyborg scholarship”. It is a fascinating and highly generative piece, and remains playful throughout; <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>early must have had a lot of fun while making it, like a child playing with Lego. It would be difficult to explain here just what the video does with its subject material (three narrative films made about the 2008 financial crash); luckily, <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary has already done that himself, in the accompanying creator’s statement, which you should definitely read prior to watching the video if you want any chance of figuring out what the hell is going&nbsp;on!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/847046095\">Moving Poems: A Raisin in the Sun (1961)</a> by Desirée de&nbsp;Jesús</p>\n\n<p>Evelyn Kreutzer’s Moving Poems collection, which pairs poems with moving images, has generated some remarkable works over the past couple of years. This video by de Jesús is one of the standout pieces. It places the 1961 adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun in dialogue with Langston Hughes’s “Harlem”, from which its title was derived. It is an intelligent and complex piece, employing multiple, dense layerings of image, sound and text, and will benefit from repeat viewings. Check it out, as well as the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/9576546\">other pieces in the collection</a> – and consider contributing your&nbsp;own.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/717263620\">Unsteady (for Elisabeth Bronfen)</a> by Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</p>\n\n<p>I will not say much about Binotto’s touching tribute to his former teacher and close friend, Elisabeth Bronfen, who retired from Zurich university this summer. You should simply watch it (all the way to the very end) and&nbsp;smile.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/815110756\">Watching the Rehearsal</a> by Jason&nbsp;Mittell</p>\n\n<p>Why leave scholarship to chance? You’d better watch Nathan Fielder’s The Rehearsal before watching this one; and while you’re at it, watch some of Professor Mittell’s previous pieces, where he established some of the ideas and approaches he’s developed here in elaborate and unexpected ways; specifically,<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/277901900\"> this</a> and<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/142425249\"> this</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.maryamtafakory.com/mast-del\">Mast-del</a> مست دل by Maryam&nbsp;Tafakory</p>\n\n<p>This last one is unfortunately not available for viewing online, and has been making the festival round this past year – go and watch it if you get the chance. Is this a video essay? I don’t know. Here is how Tafakory describes it: “A love song that would never pass through the censors, Mast-del is about forbidden bodies and desires inside and outside post-revolution Iranian cinema.” Anyone who’s seen her previous work (and if you haven’t, you’re missing out), would recognise these themes and ideas that she has dealt with before. Here, she approaches them from a radically different aesthetic, masterfully blending clips from existing films, original footage, a scripted narrative and original score, to mesmerising and moving&nbsp;effect.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"binotto\">Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</a></h3>\n\n<p>Media studies scholar, bricoleur, project leader <a href=\"https://videoessayresearch.org/\">videoessayresearch.org</a></p>\n\n<p>No representative overview, no proper summaries.

It pierces me. Everything in it. The artefacts of the video signal that devour the image, the high pitched hiss of the <span class=\"caps\">TV</span>, the calm and sober voice that speaks of memories which sound innocuous but frighten you, and then the look on this face I recognise and which I have never seen like&nbsp;that.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://necsus-ejms.org/with-a-camera-in-hand-i-was-alive/\">With a Camera in Hand, I Was Alive + Introduction</a> by Katie&nbsp;Bird</p>\n\n<p>“I keep thinking about&nbsp;gestures”.</p>\n\n<p>Katie Bird’s haunting video essay and its bittersweet introduction makes us keep thinking, keep wondering, about the weight and value of labour, of film labour, scholarly labour, of what it means to hold, a camera, a child, a body, yourself, and how we can continue by letting&nbsp;go.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/846426747\">Film Thought 5.

We need to fight a system that is already well ahead in co-opting, privatising, watermarking, and sealing the archives, depriving more and more people of their past, their collective memories.

Scrolling, clicking, touching, feeling through images and associations, a flow of intertexts at the tip of your invisible finger. You better be careful with what you open next.

In fact, he so effectively mocks these aesthetics that his work often goes viral, with choruses of the terminally online taking it, well, literally (a recent post about the unionisation of the Taylor Swift fandom comes to mind). In addition to these posts, he creates video essays outlining his observations of online behaviour. In The Literalists, he takes a look at “millennial cultural liberalism” and the inclination to scrub content clean of any possible offence, connecting the “Satanic Panic” of the 1980s to the modern, flawed reasoning that it is morally bad to watch films with immoral characters. His essays are available exclusively on his Patreon, but it’s well worth at least a month’s subscription to binge them.

Jasper Rigole’s short (aside from spotlighting his delightful<a href=\"https://iicadom.org/\"> <span class=\"caps\">IICADOM</span></a> archives, a true goldmine for home movie enthusiasts) does exactly that, while also bringing into question the spectatorship of archival&nbsp;footage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/699982796\">GeoMarkr</a> by Chloé Galibert-Laîné and Guillaume&nbsp;Grandjean</p>\n\n<p>Galibert-Laîné, brilliant as&nbsp;usual.</p>\n\n<p>Bliss.jpg by Emily Rose Apter and Elijah&nbsp;Stevens</p>\n\n<p>Some of the world’s most famous (digital — in all senses of the term) landscapes, reexamined, almost à la Richard Prince, or rather, a y2k take on the method of James Benning — brought back into materiality through 16mm&nbsp;film.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.unifrance.org/film/56547/le-film-que-vous-allez-voir\">The Film You Are About to See</a> by Maxime&nbsp;Martinot</p>\n\n<p>Despite all the hand-wringing in recent years, content warnings are by no means something new to cinema — and the double helix-like structure (going both backwards and forwards throughout the history) of Martinot’s incisive and irreverent short reveals this to the fullest, together with excavating the various mores and taboos that cinema was transgressing at various times in modern&nbsp;history.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.swissfilms.ch/en/movie/les-dieux-du-supermarche/20436371EE784510B4D92133823E62FF\">Gods of the Supermarket</a> by Alberto Gonzalez&nbsp;Morales</p>\n\n<p>I’m a sucker for any and all films that use ‘Wicked Game’ on their soundtrack.

This may testify to a growing need for personal connection through videographic practices, in the midst of a media landscape that grows more cluttered and anonymous by the day.

There is something extremely moving about the care and tenderness with which Stéphane Gérard approaches this audiovisual document, as he edits a new short portrait of Soukaz’s late lover Hervé Couergou from the thousands of hours of footage Soukaz shot, making this testimony to the history of the «années sida» and the evolution of the gay movement accessible to a new generation of spectators, artists and&nbsp;activists.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202305376.html\">Ours / Bear</a> by Morgane&nbsp;Frund</p>\n\n<p>A personal exploration of the complex power dynamics between a male filmer and female filmed subjects, when the camera is suddenly turned towards he whose gaze had hitherto remained unchallenged.

Images and sounds are saturated, superimposed, iridescent; facts and fantasies merge in a hallucinatory stream of real and fabricated memories, to which a final twist gives a whole new&nbsp;meaning.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/b5f485c0-8e35-454c-b189-539fc826a417/Dreams-About-Putin/\">Dreams About Putin</a> by Nastia Korkia and Vlad&nbsp;Fishez</p>\n\n<p>Based on a selection of actual dreams that the filmmakers collected online, this essay explores how the figure of Vladimir Putin has crept into the psyches of Russian citizens since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Disturbing, violent, absurd, the dreams are narrated in voice over and accompanied by a visual score created with the 3D graphics program Unreal Engine, interspersed with bizarre and equally absurd archival footage of Putin. A nightmarish response to a nightmarish war, waged both on the frontline and on social&nbsp;media.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk-7dyJ9Vz0\">Non-alignés: Scènes des archives Labudović / Non-Aligned: Scenes from the Labudovic Reels</a> by Mila&nbsp;Turajlic</p>\n\n<p>A portrait of Tito’s official cameraman Stevan Labudović, this feature-length essay film exhumes previously unseen archival footage from the 1961 Belgrade conference to explore the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement. As educational as it is politically sharp, the film accounts for the difficulties faced by Turajlic in working with unprocessed, barely identified archives, and offers Labudović an opportunity to share his personal and often humorous take on this turning point in the history of world&nbsp;politics.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"geller\">Jacob&nbsp;Geller</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@JacobGeller\">YouTube-based video essayist</a> writing about the intersection of games, culture, art, and&nbsp;politics</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OuaDbu_VBLY?si=jN2rYmPX6fdevFYf\">Everything Is Sludge: Art in the Post-Human Era</a> by Lily&nbsp;Alexandre</p>\n\n<p>Alexandre’s dissection of how algorithms are morphing our artistic tastes is insightful and biting. Although viewers may expect a video about <span class=\"caps\">AI</span>, more time is spent on how humans are more than willing to start producing <span class=\"caps\">AI</span>-esque content by hand in order to serve the tastes of their perceived audience. The real star of this video is the production, however. Alexandre speaks as a kaleidoscopic projection of Subway Surfer, minecraft montages, and other “sludge” is projected onto their face. As interesting as the essay’s script is, the viewer’s eye will inevitably slip to the endless stream of meaningless attention-grabbing clips – just as Alexandre intended, I&nbsp;imagine.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/P1la0GBUNB8?si=5TB98fxqQGx88mZd\">History of Handedness in Video Games</a> by Face Full of&nbsp;Eyes</p>\n\n<p>Equal parts essay and visual compendium, Face Full of Eyes’ video contains a dizzying amount of clips from hundreds of video games, all answering the same seemingly inconsequential question: how do the game’s characters handle guns with their dominant and non-dominant hands? The answer for any particular game isn’t important. The point of the video is instead that no decision is meaningless when creating art. In a created world like a video game, everything is a chance for storytelling— even the choice to depict how a left-handed person might have to reload a right-handed&nbsp;gun.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/i4EFkspO5p4?si=n3C1nziET8ojNYlc\">Four-Byte Burger</a> by&nbsp;Ahoy</p>\n\n<p>The experience of watching Ahoy attempt a perfect replication of a digital illustration from 1985 somehow captures the energy of a 21st-century sculptor attempting to re-carve Michelangelo’s David. While he starts with modern Photoshop tools, the latter half of the video is a deep dive into save file formats and 40-year old display technology; a crucial realisation in the video comes from a monitor’s changing colour tone when turned to portrait orientation. The fact that all this is in service of a delightfully whimsical picture of a burger?

Both are fascinating films, made in a video-essayistic spirit, that will hopefully circulate widely after their premiere this year at <span class=\"caps\">IFFR</span>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daynarama.com/thelma-louise-rape-culture-mudflaps-and-vaginal-horizons-video-essay/\">Thelma <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Louise: Rape Culture, Mudflaps, and Vaginal Horizons</a> by Dayna&nbsp;McLeod</p>\n\n<p>A fresh take on the beloved film Thelma <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Louise by video essayist and artist Dayna McLeod in which the final suicidal leap is transformed into a deep dive of the vagina (using an endoscopic camera)! Soon to be published in the special issue, ‘Right to Rage: Subjectivity and Activism’ edited by Barbara Zecchi and Diana Fernández Romero, in Teknokultura: Journal of Digital Culture and Social Movements (forthcoming).

I used three parameters in the composition of my list: I had to choose works by different essayists from those for whom I voted in 2022; and my selection could only feature personal favourites in the field of videographic criticism, that is, a specific film, television and screen studies subset of the “video essay”. The videos also needed to be already published and freely available online, which ruled out a lot of great works for which I will undoubtedly be voting next year. I’m betting that 2024 will be an even more excellent year for video&nbsp;essays!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/10404168/video/875575478\">Shah Rukh Khan. Screen Stars Dictionary</a> by Ritika&nbsp;Kaushik</p>\n\n<p>This was the video essay I most enjoyed watching in 2023! It was part of a joint venture inaugurated this year in which I was delighted to participate -<a href=\"https://tecmerin.uc3m.es/project/screen-stars-dictionary/?lang=en\"> The Screen Stars Dictionary</a>, launched by the Spanish audiovisual essay journal <span class=\"caps\">TECMERIN</span> in conjunction with video-essay entrepreneur extraordinaire Ariel Avissar, whose own contribution to the dictionary (on<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/10404168/video/828945225\"> Tom Cruise</a>) I also really&nbsp;loved.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/746837405\">Creative Geography, Creative Connections: Candyman</a> by John&nbsp;Gibbs</p>\n\n<p>An ambitious and highly significant work, published in <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/scapvc/film/movie\">Movie</a>, that is the perfect match of videographic critical form and content.

A great and powerful model for future work on the performativity and facticity of film and television&nbsp;locations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/responsive-eye-or-morning-show-may-destroy-you\">The Responsive Eye, or, The Morning Show May Destroy You</a> by Catherine&nbsp;Fowler</p>\n\n<p>Fowler’s magnificently inventive video essay on the two television series The Morning Show and I May Destroy You compared the relational technique that each takes to sexual abuse using a ‘feminist videographic diptych’ method. Her video formed part of a<a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-103-2023\"> brilliant special issue</a> on that method that she proposed, produced and guest edited for [in]Transition, the peer-reviewed journal I co-edit, which was full to the brim with similarly urgent and powerful feminist works using multiscreen and other juxtapositional&nbsp;procedures.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/815110756\">Watching the Rehearsal</a> by Jason&nbsp;Mittell</p>\n\n<p>This was the most original work of those I loved this year, and one I was fortunate to follow the making of while it was in progress.

This particular video, published in issue 9(4) of the journal Feminist Media Histories, is extraordinary. As the editor of that journal Jennifer Bean wrote of it in her<a href=\"https://online.ucpress.edu/fmh/article/9/4/1/197466/IntroductionFeeling-Videographic-Criticism\"> marvellous introductory essay</a> for the issue of <span class=\"caps\">FMH</span>, “[Zecchi’s] voice as well as her embodied, emotive presence on the screen are intrinsic features of a project that deploys videographic tools to sustain what she calls a ‘practice-based counterarchive’ capable of reversing the ongoing ‘dispossession’ of women’s contributions to media history.” Terri Francis’s remarkable 2019 video essay<a href=\"https://online.ucpress.edu/fmh/article/9/4/32/197468/Josephine-Baker-Watches-Herself?fbclid=IwAR0_KNgj9SMJYVwd-ueoIdUHS3jJcVcU2MTddRYiRXjrYfEMD7mD6ys0Ohs\"> Joséphine Baker Watches Herself</a> is also published in the issue’s exploration of the potential of videographic criticism for feminist media historiographies, alongside powerful new work by Celia&nbsp;Sainz.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://necsus-ejms.org/with-a-camera-in-hand-i-was-alive/\">With a Camera in Hand, I Was Alive</a> by Katie&nbsp;Bird</p>\n\n<p>Katie Bird’s virtuosic exploration of the affordances of desktop filmmaking to access the sensations of using a physical camera (and its highly original and moving audiovisual maker’s statement) made a magisterial contribution to Kevin B.

The other entries in the dossier were of excellent quality across the board, and I would particularly point to Ritika Kaushik and Brunella Tedesco-Barlocco’s great video essays for the ways in which, like Bird’s, their work points to how screen capture techniques can be harnessed to investigate very important and highly diverse screen studies research&nbsp;questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"hofmann\">Maria&nbsp;Hofmann</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/hofma071\">Film scholar</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user76036242/videos\">video essayist</a>; University of&nbsp;Minnesota</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/838267891\">Kiss me softly | crackly | sharply</a> by Lucy Fife&nbsp;Donaldson</p>\n\n<p>The combination of visuals and sound in this intriguing video forces the viewer into attention, listening and watching carefully while examining one’s own expectations and intimate reactions to individual&nbsp;moments.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zfmedienwissenschaft.de/en/online/videography-blog/nebular-epistemics\">Nebular Epistemics</a> by Alan <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary</p>\n\n<p>Incredibly dense on a theoretical level, performatively innovative, and yet still accessible and hilarious — what an accomplishment to combine these elements into a coherent whole and convincing&nbsp;argument.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tecmerin.uc3m.es/project/being-dolls-or-not-spinning-mothers-and-daughters-in-elena-ferrantes-adaptations/?lang=en\">Being Dolls (or Not): Spinning Mothers and Daughters in Elena Ferrante’s Adaptations</a> by Barbara&nbsp;Zecchi</p>\n\n<p>A dazzling watching experience that masterfully interweaves critical argument with audiovisual spectacle; a prime example of Zecchi’s superior sense of rhythm that permeates all her&nbsp;work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/home-bleak-home-bleak\">Home Is Bleak.

Attracted by the potential, they began by destroying everything. Then it was time to rebuild. To the weight of the rubble cans was added the weight of their families’ dreams and values. With affection and humour, Sophie deconstructs patriarchy, capitalism and inheritance in an attempt to make room for achievable&nbsp;utopias.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202304474.html\">Marungka Tjalatjunu (Dipped in Black)</a> by Derik Lynch, Matthew&nbsp;Thorne</p>\n\n<p>The film follows Yankunytjatjara man Derik Lynch’s road trip back to Country for spiritual healing, as memories from his childhood return. A journey from the oppression of white city life in Adelaide, back home to his remote Anangu Community (Aputula) to perform on sacred Inma ground. Inma is a traditional form of storytelling using the visual, verbal, and physical. It is how Anangu Tjukurpa (story connected to country / dreaming / myth / lore) have been passed down for over 60,000+ years from generation to&nbsp;generation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://juliaborderie.com/en/aequo/\">Æquo</a> by Eloïse Le Gallo, Julia&nbsp;Borderie</p>\n\n<p>The sound of an alphorn echoes in the mountains while glaciers are dripping. Far away, on an oceanographic boat, researchers probe the invisible seabed. Geological bodies of salt and ice emerge from the digital depths of a software. They melt and disintegrate in the hands of scientists. The filmmakers place encounters at the heart of their approach, anchoring their creative process in a poetic&nbsp;approach.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oyster-films.info/pacific-club\">Pacific Club</a> by Valentin&nbsp;Noujaïm</p>\n\n<p>In 1979, the Pacific Club opened in the basement of La Défense, the business district of Paris. It was the first nightclub for Arabs from the suburbs – a parallel world of dance, sweat, young love, and one-night utopias. Azedine, 17 years old at the time, tells us the forgotten story of this club and of this generation who dreamed of integrating into France but who soon came face to face with racism, the <span class=\"caps\">AIDS</span> epidemic, and heroin. The film gives visibility to the forgotten, the invisible and reflects on the power dynamics and dominance system within French&nbsp;society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.swissfilms.ch/en/movie/Out-of-the-Blue/A1DDED4E78CB4ECF839C9CECF54CA3EB\">Out of the Blue</a> by Morgane&nbsp;Frund</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, an auteur film causes a scandal due to its sex scenes. The filmmaker is 16 and one of the angry viewers. Ten years later, she is ready to settle the score with this film in the form of a video essay. Her film visits ways to tame the ‘male gaze’ and understand her position in a still man-made/thought&nbsp;world.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/us/films/tierra-de-leche\">Tierra de leche</a> by Milton Guillen and Fiona Guy&nbsp;Hall</p>\n\n<p>On New England dairy farms, daily life orbits around the milking parlour. Here, machinery and cows come together as an exploitation mechanism of migrant workers from Central America, consuming their every waking hour and even infiltrating their dreams.

Maza is an online video veteran, previously creating for Vox. His independent work allows him to flex his style: a blend of professionalism that says “this is worth taking seriously and I’ve put in the work” and casualness that says “we’re still going to make a tough topic go down easy.” He tackles some of the most contentious topics affecting our political landscape – this video covers the manufacturing of the “debt crisis” in the minds of the American public. The heart of each video lies in the wrap-up: Carlos has a knack for leaving viewers off with a perfect mix of “this sucks,” and “but I believe in us” and finally, “fuck&nbsp;yeah.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV8BnxuPF2Y&amp;ab_channel=JamesDeLisio\">Cinema in Pain: Decoding “Mad God”</a> by James&nbsp;DeLisio</p>\n\n<p>“Physical pain does not simply resist language but actively destroys&nbsp;it.”</p>\n\n<p>This thought-provoking video is an approachable look at a notoriously repulsive film (which I do not say lightly, as a squeamish viewer myself!). It proposes one lens of interpretation: what if a film like Mad God is our best chance as an audience to experience an articulation of pain through art? If pain is incommunicable through words, what sights and sounds, what deviations from expectation, can bring us into that headspace? This examination of the non-straightforward means through which cinema may operate has bent my brain, and I must recommend that you experience it for&nbsp;yourself.</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"slice_articles\" data-paragraph-id=\"0a2604fa-8c6d-484b-b076-7998b58c84f0\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"719448\" data-paragraph-type=\"video_embed\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlu-Ffdxocc&amp;ab_channel=maxteeth\">The Man/Car Gender Binary in John Carpenter’s Christine</a> by max&nbsp;teeth</p>\n\n<p>“Men are of course men and cars are cars but women are also&nbsp;cars.”</p>\n\n<p>In the vein of Women Are Not Objects, but Objects Are Still Women, Max takes us through the special cinematic relationships between a man and his car, a man and his car who is also a woman, and a man and another man and a car which is somewhere nearby. The point: how have we learned to signify masculinity on screen? And how does John Carpenter’s Christine induce horror by perverting those signifiers? A cherry on top: this video is&nbsp;hilarious.</p>\n\n<p>As a bonus, I’ll also recommend <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_jScGztAlus?si=BJ-XXSCN_13khU7Y\">their video on Hereditary</a> for its crisp, creative, and playful visual&nbsp;style.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2N_SGny_-0&amp;list=LL&amp;index=82&amp;ab_channel=TheNukes\">The Essential Whiteness of One-Hit Wonders</a> by The&nbsp;Nukes</p>\n\n<p>“Hey Josh, you’re white. Who sang Tainted Love? I answered easily and without thought: ‘Soft Cell.’ But a few have offered me a truth that I, in my whiteness, did not know then, but do know now. Soft Cell’s Tainted Love is a&nbsp;cover.”</p>\n\n<p>This is a tale as old as time, and yet even if you think you know this story, this video is a journey worth taking. Josh from The Nukes takes us on a personal musical tour through the many, many hidden (and not so hidden) ways that the music industry has historically catered to white sensibilities. Interesting, frustrating, and relentlessly funny – make sure to read the chapter markers for an extra dose of “this creator is having way too much&nbsp;fun.”</p>\n\n<p>(Another bonus recommendation: Josh’s “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hoVIjjD3Os4?si=EaWiOGjneMhYkDBY\">Is it Impossible to Dad</a>” is a heartfelt, prescient examination of the gap we attempt to bridge in parenthood – and in all relationships, really.

Well, in that vein, Kendra’s channel has been a fantastic discovery for me this year. Kendra talks about architecture the way I talk about That One Funny Thing My Friend Did That One Time. Her style feels comfy and inclusionary, like you’re both laughing&nbsp;together.</p>\n\n<p>It’s always fun letting someone take you on a journey through their random obsession, and watching all 151 Architectural Digest home tours probably enters “obsession” territory (and yet, one gets the sense that if not for the video, Kendra still would’ve done this anyway). The impression is less “I self-flagellate for content,” and more “let me give you my best takeaways from a task that you will likely never do yourself.” The difference between the two, I realised, is surprisingly important to&nbsp;me!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrT1aLP1xaU&amp;list=LL&amp;index=44&amp;ab_channel=KaiAfterKai\">The Importance of Spaces in The Last Black Man in San Francisco</a> by&nbsp;KaiAfterKai</p>\n\n<p>This video is a lovely exploration of the importance of personal connection to space, the ability to self-actualise through space, and connection to history through space, which all feel especially prescient to a generation of young adults who have been gatekept from home&nbsp;ownership.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like listening to a guided meditation tape; Kai is, as always, soothing in their delivery, punctuated by perfect music choices and encapsulated within a flawless structure.

Specifically, she calls attention to the way that people discover new lifestyles through the Internet, and whether the people selling that lifestyle are leaving out important details (and why they may be incentivised to do&nbsp;so!).</p>\n\n<p>Following up on her 2022 video on the Netflix show Motel Makeover, this video continues Maggie’s deep dives into the ways in which the lens of “content” turns building and designing spaces into a sales pitch, while unearthing the hidden costs that these shows are not incentivised to&nbsp;reveal.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"kiss\">Miklós&nbsp;Kiss</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://research.rug.nl/en/persons/mikl%C3%B3s-kiss\">Associate professor in audiovisual arts and cognition</a> at University of Groningen, <span class=\"caps\">NL</span> / co-author of <a href=\"https://scalar.usc.edu/works/film-studies-in-motion/index\">Film Studies in Motion: From Audiovisual Essay to Academic Research&nbsp;Video</a></p>\n\n<p>Trying to have a full grasp on a year’s videographic output is increasingly becoming an impossible effort.

A 27-minute contemplatively thorough dissection of Joris Ivens’ 12-minute short film Regen [Rain] – that creates an ‘archetypal rainstorm’ out of an 8-month sampling of rainy images – is exactly such a videographic&nbsp;work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/809458111\">Some Thoughts Occasioned by Four Desktops</a> by Ariel&nbsp;Avissar</p>\n\n<p>An attentive response, in desktop video form, to the four desktop videos (by Johannes Binotto, Katie Bird, Brunella Tedesco-Barlocco, and Ritika Kaushik – wish I could include all these videos in this best-of selection) that were part of the audiovisual section of the Spring edition of the Necsus journal.

Such tender intervention is not only a lovely tribute to Kiarostami but in fact a brilliant way of illustrating his characteristic “gentle humanism … that reveals the cosmic majesty and mystery of ordinary life” (The Criterion Collection for Kiarostami’s The Koker&nbsp;Trilogy).</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"kooijman\">Jaap&nbsp;Kooijman</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/o/j.w.kooijman/j.w.kooijman.html#English\">Associate professor Media Studies</a> at the University of&nbsp;Amsterdam</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/828945268\">Natalia Oreiro</a> by Jiří Anger and Veronika&nbsp;Hanáková</p>\n\n<p>Part of the innovative Screen Stars Dictionary series published by Tecmerin, “Natalia Oreiro” by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková stands out in both topic and aesthetics. The essay breaks with the <span class=\"caps\">US</span>-dominance in the study of (global) stardom by focusing on a Latin American star who becomes famous in Russia, Israel, and Central-European countries, thereby calling attention to a transnational movement that is not often addressed in star studies. The playful aesthetics of early 2000 digital culture highlights the importance of the internet in this transnational movement between “periphery” and&nbsp;“periphery.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://online.ucpress.edu/fmh/article/9/4/32/197468/Josephine-Baker-Watches-Herself\">Joséphine Baker Watches Herself</a> by Terri&nbsp;Francis</p>\n\n<p>Published in Feminist Media Histories, “Joséphine Baker Watches Herself” by Terri Francis shows the added value of videographic criticism to more conventional academic work. By connecting archival footage of early stage performances by Joséphine Baker to televised interviews with the iconic star in which she looks back and comments on her own star image, provides space for the Baker’s agency and voice within the narrative of her stardom in a way that could not be done so effectively (and affectively) in a written&nbsp;essay.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste\">chaste/unchaste</a> by Maryam Tafakory Published in [in]Transition, “chaste/unchaste” by Maryam Tafakory effectively challenges the binary that is spelled out in the title. Starting with a four-way split screen and a graphic that looks like a target finder from a rifle (or like a measuring rod), the audiovisual essay presents images of women from Iranian cinema, thereby highlighting how they are continuously scrutinised and policed, yet also how they challenge the omnipresent gaze. Using mirroring and repetition, combined by an uncanny soundtrack, the essay forces viewers (at least me) to question their preconceived notions and binary thinking. And what a surprise when the credits reveal that the footage comes from 32 films! As Maria Walsh concludes in her peer-review of the essay: “This is brave&nbsp;work.”</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"kreutzer\">Evelyn&nbsp;Kreutzer</a></h3>\n\n<p>Postdoctoral researcher and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/evelynkreutzer\">video essayist</a>, <a href=\"https://www.filmuniversitaet.de/en/portrait/person/evelyn-kreutzer\">Film University Babelsberg Konrad&nbsp;Wolf</a></p>\n\n<p>Just like in past years, I want to emphasise that I do not consider this a or my “best of” list but rather a list of video essays from different sub-genres and platforms that I found particularly interesting this year and with which I aim to hint at the breadth of video essay&nbsp;production.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KauemIMxFo\">moving poems: a raisin in the sun (1961)</a> by Desirée de&nbsp;Jesús</p>\n\n<p>An evocative and very layered meditation on poetry, drama, film and their (cross-)adaptations.

I really loved how they manage to produce a feminist and environmental analysis of the film using these layouts, subverting our video-essayistic habits (using cinema as a hermeneutic tool) by calling on videogame grammar to study&nbsp;film.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ommX0US1llM\">O fumo do fogo (Smoke of the Fire)</a> by Daryna&nbsp;Mamaisur</p>\n\n<p>Daryna Mamaisur is a Ukrainian artist and a refugee in Portugal. In her essay, she films closeups of her Portuguese handbooks, finding echoes of dispatches her friend sends her from their country – the dots and shapes of the three-colour printing of the old-fashioned books resemble the low-quality videos. I was fascinated by the way Mamaisur films her hands hovering over her desktop covered by childlike images, and how as soon as the editing flips them, the war and its trauma&nbsp;appears.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/819559793\">البحث عن السوري الإرهابي In Search of the Syrian Fanatic </a> by Abou&nbsp;Naddara</p>\n\n<p>The Syrian filmmaker collective Abou Naddara conducted this year a multimedia investigation about an image and a corpse, both hidden underneath layers of French colonial propaganda. The images come from one of the first silent fiction films, The Assassination of General Kléber (Georges Hatot, 1897), depicting the murder of the Napoleonic officer in 1800 by a Syrian student in Egypt. Abou Naddara discovered the remains of the presumed perpetrator, Soleyman El-Halebi, are kept by a French Museum, in its colonial collection and decided to take action: he wrote both a written and a videographic letter to French authorities, asking them to return the body as well as renounce the racist cliché, first printed in visual culture by the 1897 film, of the fanatic&nbsp;Syrian.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zent93oWko\">Alain Krivine, le trotskisme permanent (Alain Krivine, the Permanent Trotskism)</a> by Usul and&nbsp;Ostpolitik</p>\n\n<p>This video is part of a series created by the French videaste Usul and Ostpolitik, the “Portraits” telling the stories of central figures of French political history in a critical perspective (the series is published for the online channel Blast, continued by Ostpolitik and another youtuber, Modiie; meanwhile, Usul started another series, “Rhinoceros” about the rightisation of media). Together, they also produced “Ouvrez les guillemets” (“Open the Quotes”) (for the online journal Mediapart) about political news. I wanted to cite one of their works for several reasons. One of them is that I find it very interesting how a video essay can engage with social and political criticism through mediatic images – the way Serge Daney, for instance, used to do it in a textual way in Libération. I also wanted to pay a specific homage to Usul, who for the last ten years, is, in my opinion, the most stimulating political video essayist of the French YouTube landscape and draws me to the art of montage and media criticism with his latest series “Mes chers contemporains” (“Dear&nbsp;Contemporaries”).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chloegalibertlaine.com/i-would-like-to-rage\">I Would Like to Rage</a> by Chloé&nbsp;Galibert-Laîné</p>\n\n<p>Finally and above all, I wanted to mention a piece by Chloé Galibert-Laîné, whose work in general is of crucial importance to me, and whose I Would Like to Rage, in particular, touched me enormously. As I had the chance to tell them, their work navigates brilliantly the tricky art of self-memeification to address gendered and intimate political issues, escaping every trap set by the internalised (patriarchal) injunctions of concealing the “I” and its&nbsp;revolts.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"laird\">Colleen&nbsp;Laird</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.ubc.ca/profile/colleen-laird/\">Assistant professor</a> of Japanese cinema, The University of British&nbsp;Columbia</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/841304471\">Thelma <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Louise: Rape Culture, Mudflaps, <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Vaginal Horizons </a>by Dayna&nbsp;McLeod</p>\n\n<p>With this righteous and riotous very close look at Ridley Scott’s Thelma <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Louise (1991), Dayna McLeod continues to be one of the boldest and bravest new practitioners of the video essay. Constructed in three acts, the piece highlights the interplay between actions and reactions, both in the film and beyond to the discourse surrounding it. The end result, and in particular the resulting ending, is a thought-provoking dive into videographic criticism and film&nbsp;scholarship.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste\">chaste/unchaste</a> by Maryam&nbsp;Tafakory</p>\n\n<p>Every time I watch a piece by Maryam Tafakory, I am overwhelmed by contradictory emotions. “chaste/unchaste,” Tafakory’s contribution to the ‘Feminist Videographic Diptych’ special issue of [in]Transition, is no exception. The use of uncanny repetition and graphic matches is both mesmerising and agitating, familiarising and defamiliarising, grounding and destabilising. And as always, I’m stunned by the quantity of films Tafakory uses to create the illusion of effortless coherent&nbsp;cohesion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://deformativesoundlab.co.uk/2023/09/27/super-volume-a-tactile-art/\">A Tactile Art</a> by Cormac&nbsp;Donnelly</p>\n\n<p>It’s worthwhile to access Cormac Donnelly’s “second iteration of the Super Volume project” on his Deformative Sound Lab website to read about the process of making a video that is very much about process and processing. While Donnelly considers the piece a representation of a tactile art, what haunts me about the video is the juxtaposition of the ephemerality in the piece—both of the transparent layering of the participants’ hands as well as the audio track itself—with the technology at the intersection of the two: the artefact of interaction. I find this work unsettling in the very best of&nbsp;ways.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/872459036\">Cycles of Labour: In the Metaverse, We Will Be Housewives</a> by Veronika Hanáková, Martin Tremčinský, and Jiří&nbsp;Anger</p>\n\n<p>With each collaborative work, I find the dynamic duo of Veronica Hanáková and Jiří Anger increasingly enchanting. I can’t help it; I like their style. I was torn between this video and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/groups/audiovisualcy/videos/828945268\">their entry</a> in Ariel Avissar’s new Screen Stars Dictionary project which has some similar formal conceits, but the tongue-in-cheek nature of reframing Jeanne Dielmann’s daily routine as a “The Sim’s”-esque video game was the deciding factor. All too often, scholarly videographic criticism can feel heavy and bleak, particularly with trends in exploring thematised trauma. Here, along with Martin Tremčinský, Hanáková and Anger make a case for serious&nbsp;fun.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alisonpeirse.com/crochet-is-sick\">Crochet Is Sick</a> by Alison&nbsp;Peirse</p>\n\n<p>A companion piece to last year’s award-winning and frequent festival feature “Knit One, Stab Two,” here Alison Peirse shifts a feminist lens from the needle to the hook, and from the voice-over to the visualised voice, in this work on the role of crochet in horror. Peirse is developing a distinct videographic style and “Crochet” is a prime example of this aesthetic that takes the video essay (and what we think we know about horror) delightfully and impishly up a notch (or three). Note the original soundtrack created especially for the&nbsp;work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chloegalibertlaine.com/i-would-like-to-rage\">I Would Like to Rage</a> by Chloé&nbsp;Galibert-Laîné</p>\n\n<p>Currently only available on the festival circuit, Chloé Galibert-Laîné’s most recent work is a deeply personal performance of catharsis years in the making. It is also, thankfully, very funny. The video is an inspiring whirlwind through multiple media objects and platforms, a flurry of failed and forced expressions of rage, that sticks its landing and compels us, once again, to rethink what we know about the potentials of the video essay. Details about forthcoming availability are likely to be found on their website in the&nbsp;future.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/lacurieo\">Xena’s Body: A Menstrual Auto-Investigation Using an iPhone</a> by Occitane&nbsp;Lacurie</p>\n\n<p>I had the pleasure of seeing this video as a work in progress piece at the ‘In the Works: Makings and Unmakings of the Video Essay’ conference held at the Lucerne School of Art and Design at the beginning of November of this year. Even in an unfinished form, it was still one of my favourite videos I encountered this year, as well as one of the most timely. A desktop video in cell phone portrait mode, and perhaps even edited on one, Lacurie’s remarkable production brings together the personal and the political through the act of “doom scrolling” that involves, among other things, an episode of “Xena: Warrior Princess,” the iPhone menstruation application, text messages, online message boards, demonic imaginations of cell phone home screens, website searches, and an online tarot reading.

Seeing it again this year at the Hamburger Bahnhof, I could appreciate how much care it takes in reconstructing sites of Algerian cinema: not only sets from films set in Algeria, but also spaces where Algerian cinema is screened, preserved and contemplated.

This enthralling and meticulously edited piece uses a binary of chaste vs. unchaste to collapse in on itself as a gendered structure of representation in Iranian cinema. Tafakory uses repetition and juxtaposition to emphasise this undoing and mirrors clips of women in grids of four where they are (now) engaged with each other onscreen. She overlays certain clips, which seep into and onto each other as a form of touching, as if to queer the materiality of these clips as well as the newly formed relationships she has created through her&nbsp;editing.</p>\n\n<p>Xena’s Body: A Menstrual Auto-Investigation Using an iPhone by Occitane&nbsp;Lacurie</p>\n\n<p>A masterful and hypnotic piece that is seemingly edited on a smartphone that simultaneously demonstrates the source materials and inspiration for the work, while showing the methods and thinking of its construction. Lacurie takes us on an expansive menstruation journey that is personal and political—navigating apps, memes, video clips, and a tarot card reading through the analysis of a fatal penetrative wound on Xena Warrior Princess’s body. A mesmerising video essay from, In the Works: Makings and Unmakings of the Video Essay, Lucerne School of Art and Design, Switzerland.

Galibert-Laîné’s thorough and thoughtful practice is fully on display as they take us through various machinations of online and mediatised rage, its performativity, expression, and ownership, and how they experience or rather, attempt to experience rage authentically. A triumph of intelligent vulnerability expressed through an assemblage of self-reflection, video clips, memes, gifs, and Leslie Knope homages, this endearing delight of a video essay is surely coming to a film festival near&nbsp;you.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/838267891\">Kiss me softly | crackly | sharply</a> by Lucy Fife&nbsp;Donaldson</p>\n\n<p>An impeccable experimental video essay that exaggerates and emphasises the uncanny through foley and feminist intervention. Fife Donaldson aptly mixes and amplifies the sharp edges of <span class=\"caps\">ASMR</span> sound artist Julie Rose Bower’s work by replacing the soundtrack for the knife scene in Kiss Me Deadly. Switchblades pop and fist punches snap and crack onscreen through Fife Donaldson’s use of this unique collection of sound, and her use of visual repetition and slow motion. I am particularly drawn to how she lingers on sound during a slow motion shot of the would-be attacker’s descent to the ground as he slides down a wall after the attempted knife&nbsp;fight.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/786280371\">Practices of Viewing: Ending </a>by Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</p>\n\n<p>A gong repeatedly sounds as ‘The End’ title text from a variety of films are shown onscreen in several languages. We hear a tapping—a soft clicking that is perhaps his keyboard, our viewership guided by his hand. The way that Binotto has arranged these endings and silenced their corresponding soundtracks are filled with loss as they each mark an ending to a specific film as well as the end of his incredible <a href=\"https://transferences.org/videoessays/practices-of-viewing/\">Practices of Viewing series</a>. Binotto cites Roland Barthes while seemingly articulating his own work ethic: “writing as absolute brings with it a particular existential movement: the drive to finish the work in order to start again”. I can’t wait to see what comes&nbsp;next.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/847046095\">moving poems: a raisin in the sun (1961)</a> by Desirée de&nbsp;Jesús</p>\n\n<p>Using Evelyn Kreutzer’s Moving Poems prompt that asks makers to pair a poem with a media object, moving poems: a raisin in the sun (1961) is a poignant and poetic work that capitalises on affecting performances from the 1961 film adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun. De Jesús engages Langston Hughes’s short poem Harlem in onscreen text while expertly and artfully using opacity, repetition, movement, dialogue, and match cuts to sound in this stunning and layered poetic video&nbsp;essay.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/854913117\">Jeanne Dielman: On / Off</a> by Dan&nbsp;Noall</p>\n\n<p>A sublime supercut of every time the title character of Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles turns on and off the lights. Noall jumpcuts us through each of the rooms of this film and the quiet bland domesticity of house and sex work with this simple task. Only fans of this iconic film will recognise the importance of Noall’s final shot where Jeanne turns off the light of the kitchen while firmly grasping her silver scissors and shutting the door behind her with a&nbsp;thud.</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"slice_articles\" data-paragraph-id=\"9f5a5914-d47c-40e3-a20b-0baecdd52035\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"719465\" data-paragraph-type=\"video_embed\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"meadows\">Queline&nbsp;Meadows</a></h3>\n\n<p>Video essayist (as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC823RgYGE4ASwksrIvIySAQ\">kikikrazed</a>) and community manager for <a href=\"https://theessaylibrary.com/\">The Essay&nbsp;Library</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/X9RYuvPCQUA\">Everything is a Remix (Complete Updated 2023 Edition)</a> by Kirby&nbsp;Ferguson</p>\n\n<p>Kirby Ferguson has revisited this project multiple times since it debuted in 2010, remixing his own work to create new iterations. The 2023 edition, described as “the definitive Everything is a Remix experience” by Ferguson, includes a new part about <span class=\"caps\">AI</span> art, also released individually in 2023. Unfortunately, the video currently sits at under 100,000 views on YouTube due to unjust copyright claims that contradict fair use and the remix&nbsp;philosophy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hgaU4eqV-pY\">The <span class=\"caps\">PS1</span> Start-up Tells a Story</a> by Dennis&nbsp;Gallagher</p>\n\n<p>Gallagher’s 40-second essay (really only 30 seconds if you forget the credits) is a perfect example of a video essay with zero fluff. He narrates alongside the PlayStation startup sequence, guiding us through it with a sense of awe. The fantastic digital portal metaphor doesn’t overstay its welcome in this bite-sized&nbsp;treat.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/i4EFkspO5p4\">Four-Byte Burger</a> by Stuart Brown&nbsp;(Ahoy)</p>\n\n<p>Brown documents his faithful recreation of his favourite piece of Amiga art, Jack Haeger’s Four-Byte Burger.

In my own video essay work, Be Kind Rewind is one of my biggest inspirations. Every video amazes me with the sheer knowledge and passion for film on display. This essay is no different as it juggles the interconnected careers of actors, producers, and directors within the studio system at the&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/wV8BnxuPF2Y\">Cinema in Pain: Decoding “Mad God”</a> by James&nbsp;DeLisio</p>\n\n<p>Some video essays that rely on literature to examine a film can become too text-heavy, but this essay never feels like that. DeLisio’s careful narration and textured sound design allows him to speak with the film instead of over it. This intelligent, well-edited video cements James DeLisio’s status as one of the most exciting emerging video&nbsp;essayists.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"natalio\">Carlos&nbsp;Natálio</a></h3>\n\n<p>Film teacher and researcher at Escola das Artes in Católica University (O Porto); film programmer at IndieLisboa Film Festival; film critic at <a href=\"https://apaladewalsh.com/\">À pala de Walsh</a> website.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agencia.curtas.pt/filmes/show/570\">Exotic Words Drifted</a> by Sandro&nbsp;Aguilar</p>\n\n<p>At the edge of the word lies silence, hesitation. On the other side of colour, there are bright colours, gray, black and white. This is a film that sits on the other side of the mirror and takes us through the tense and enigmatic reverse side of classic cinema. In Aguilar’s audiovisual essay, everything floats, expectantly, waiting to happen, inaugurating a new order, like a tense relationship between day and night, between the negative and the positive of a film&nbsp;stock.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/history-world-according-getty-images\">A History of the World According to Getty Images </a>by Richard&nbsp;Misek</p>\n\n<p>Audiovisual essays are tools to unlock the imaginary and highlight possible paths and barriers. Misek’s work invites us to understand the struggles to show and hide images in contemporary digital agoras, where public versus private ownership is at stake in order to disseminate controlled versions of&nbsp;history.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/867126855\">Réseau des sens</a> by Mirjam&nbsp;Leutwiler</p>\n\n<p>For each contact, each touch there is a split “I”, a network of sensation. Mirjam Leutwiler’s short audiovisual essay is not only interpreting Michel Serre’s text “The Five Senses. A Philosophy of Mingled Bodies”, but also telling us how that network about touching and feeling is underway in the cinematic&nbsp;phenomenology.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/877135063\">Kinoapparatum Remade. A Videographic Montage Experiment.</a> by Johannes Binotto, Maurice Dietziker, Linus Bolliger, Arseni Gavrilov, Kilian Frei, Andrina Moos, Cécile Brossard, Sven Friedli, Mirjam Leutwiler, Jana Schlegel, Melina Hofer, Anja Hubmann, Fynn Groeber, Nora&nbsp;Gruetter.</p>\n\n<p>Kinoapparatum Remade is not only an homage to Vertov, Kaufman and Svilova’s seminal film Man with a Movie Camera. And also not only a reflection on Manovich’s ideas on the film regarding new media. It is all of this but it is also a collective collaborative effort in which we can see that recreation it also followed by actualisation, complementation and creative choices based on movement and form. And these particular choices of the “collective with the moving images” tells us that it is not only a question of past versus incoming future when we look at 1929’s&nbsp;masterpiece.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/841294355\">Against Polish or, Notes on Videographic Labor or, You Could Remix Blazing Saddles Today </a>Will&nbsp;Digravio</p>\n\n<p>Digravio’s original audiovisual essay may work against the idea of perfection and neatness as a possible disguised style. But it is also an exposition of the work involved in the audiovisual essay. In this sense, it enters a loop, a mise-en-abîme where a “meta worker” develops a similar “meta mirror” to better highlight the nature of what is involved when reworking the images and sounds of a&nbsp;film.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"ogara\">Clare <span class=\"caps\">O’G</span>ara</a></h3>\n\n<p>Media and cultural studies graduate student at the University of&nbsp;Wisconsin–Madison</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/EiZhdpLXZ8Q?si=q5MZJQG94Z4013uS\">The Future Is a Dead Mall — Decentraland and the Metaverse</a> by Dan Olson (Folding&nbsp;Ideas)</p>\n\n<p>Another long-form triumph from the creator of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YQ_xWvX1n9g?si=SE_fcCi_C4FmDO13\">Line Goes Up – The Problem with <span class=\"caps\">NTF</span>s</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JTfhYyTuT44?si=eOm3t0z8Ox-Dg8P5\">In Search of a Flat Earth</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/SArtgoMMDNg?si=PGXEZSdA7rZaGUH0\">Searching for Humanity in Fortnite’s Battle Royale</a> by Jonathan McIntosh (Pop Culture&nbsp;Detective)</p>\n\n<p>A fusion between a “Let’s Play” and a conventional YouTube video essay, this moving autoethnography finds optimism and community in one of the most unlikely online gaming&nbsp;spaces.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OuaDbu_VBLY?si=-pCjdg9zMYL9ILJV\">Everything Is Sludge: Art in the Post-Human Era</a> by Lily&nbsp;Alexandre</p>\n\n<p>Alexandre’s cleverly profound work on gender, sexuality, art, and digital culture never disappoints.

Let me name some makers in addition to the many mentioned below that have impacted my understanding of the practice this year: Ariane Hudelet, Cormac Donnelly, Dayna McLeod, Irina Trocan, Jemma Saunders, John Gibbs, Kevin Ferguson, Liz Greene, Maria Hofmann, Maud Ceuterick, Oswald Iten, Richard Misek, Susan Harewood… My point with this list, which could have been indefinitely extended, is that investigating the possibilities of the video essay is a collective endeavour. Brian Eno has a notion of collective ‘scenius’ (as opposed to individual ‘genius’) which refers to “the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene”: it’s this boisterous collective intelligence that I think we’re witnessing with the explosion of the video essay. Can it last? I do worry that the period of expansion, exploration and experimentation will exhaust itself, and that a single preferred mode of audiovisual rhetoric will be asserted or be insisted upon by the journals. I’m relieved this hasn’t happened yet, not in 2023 at any rate. And so my selection (which could easily have been several further sets of seven videos) is intended to indicate some of the striking variety, as well as the quality, of the work being done.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/827670996\">Memories of It</a> by Kathleen Loock<br>\n<br>\n‘Memories of It’ mixes film, trailer and documentary footage with personal reflection and interview in order to tease out Kathleen Loock’s traumatic memory of watching (and fast-forwarding) the 1990 adaptation of It on <span class=\"caps\">VHS</span> as a child. She links this memory with the condition of the Wendekinder, children like her of the former <span class=\"caps\">GDR</span> forced to cope with a new world after German reunification. Does Kathleen over-sociologise her act of retrospectatorship by invoking shared generational experience? Is the video an attempt to contain as well as explain the threat of traumatic eruption? I’ll just have to watch ‘it’ again…<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/everybody%E2%80%99s-gotta-learn-sometime\">Everybody’s Gotta Learn Sometime</a> by Drew&nbsp;Morton</p>\n\n<p>Thomas Pynchon’s Vineland is my favourite novel and one joy of my 2023 was encountering Peter Coviello’s Vineland Reread, a book that mixes literary criticism, cultural theory and autobiography to evoke the presence of Vineland in Coviello’s life and teaching. Drew Morton’s account of re-viewing and teaching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind at intervals since that film’s release is a similarly rich and joyful intellectual experience – Drew even shares some hard-earned lessons in love. (I recommend comparing the earlier version of the video linked in the creator statement, to see how an adept maker engages with challenging peer&nbsp;review.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/723431318\">Desktop Documentary</a> by Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</p>\n\n<p>Johannes Binotto’s literally/ironically titled ‘Desktop Documentary’ is expressly a “call to clutter”. As such, it makes me terribly anxious. But this is a brilliantly conceived and engagingly performed piece of explicatory and programmatic rhetoric that draws on YouTube how-to videos even as it nods to the opening of Cléo de 5 à 7. I am happy to grant Binotto’s fiction that his desk has not been curated because I am persuaded by his account of the desktop as recalcitrant technology. And I am especially seduced by his call for productive accident and a-rational research methods that look back to&nbsp;surrealism.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/true-enough\">True Enough</a> by Chloé&nbsp;Galibert-Laîné</p>\n\n<p>True Enough might seem a jeu d’esprit compared to Chloé Galibert-Laîné’s longer video essays. But even as it draws on the functional aesthetic of the karaoke video, this adaptation of a text by Will Webb, made for Ariel Avissar and Evelyn Kreutzer’s Once upon A Screen project, is a work of great refinement. Galibert-Laîné creates a “fictional offscreen space” with beautifully composed filmed footage enlivened by dancing light from an unseen television. The cheerful font and sung accompaniment extend the possibilities of onscreen text and voiceover. As an added bonus (or intrinsic moment), it contains the best Simpsons allusion&nbsp;ever.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste\">chaste/unchaste</a> by Maryam&nbsp;Tafakory</p>\n\n<p>This has been a vintage year for multiscreen. Like the videos by Mittell and Arlander discussed below, Colleen Laird’s Eye-Camera-Ninagawa and Adam Cook’s A Cinema of Bodily Sense deploy multiscreen in powerful but contrasting ways. Maryam Tafakory uses it differently again in ‘chaste/unchaste’. The video is a supercut of female faces (plus one big cat and a gas hob) made from thirty-two Iranian films. It stages its imagining of queer desire as a progression from multiscreen to single screen to superimposition. ‘chaste/unchaste’ is a condensed masterclass in how argument can be made in formal terms without the aid of&nbsp;voiceover.</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"slice_articles\" data-paragraph-id=\"167854aa-b1ce-44f5-a155-08b62f004688\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"719550\" data-paragraph-type=\"video_embed\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.16-9.dk/2023/02/169-seconds-breaking-bad/\">169 Seconds: Trimming Time in Breaking Bad</a> by Jason&nbsp;Mittell</p>\n\n<p>To celebrate its twentieth anniversary, the Danish film journal 16:9 has been publishing 169-second video essays in a series that features makers like Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin, Jaap Kooijman, Catherine Grant, and Barbara Zecchi, with two impressive videos by my Aarhus colleague Mathias Bonde Korsgaard. My favourite is Jason Mittell’s cheeky afterthought to his videographic project on Breaking Bad (it traces Walter White’s story arc through his hairstyles). I like how the application of strict but ludic formal parameters, which Mittell derives from the journal name and video duration, generate a cryptic visual tapestry of the entire&nbsp;series.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://screenworks.org.uk/archive/volume-13-1/revisiting-the-aspen-tree\">Revisiting the Aspen Tree</a> by Annette&nbsp;Arlander</p>\n\n<p>Between 2002 and 2014, artist Annette Arlander recorded weekly visits to locations on Harakka Island near Helsinki in a series of videos. In Revisiting the Aspen Tree, she returns to one such site and embeds those videos in the video document of the more recent visit. Differently from Mittell’s Trimming Time, Arlander uses parameters to dictate a practice that is physical, repetitive and durational. But it reminds me of Will DiGravio’s Rio Bravo project, and like DiGravio’s four-hour Against Polish, it suggests the value of an ‘ambient’ scholarship, in which iterative academic labour is presented in something like real&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"burns\">Michael <span class=\"caps\">O’N</span>eill&nbsp;Burns</a></h3>\n\n<p>Host and producer at&nbsp;Wisecrack</p>\n\n<p>My selections focus on creators who are pushing the critical boundaries of the video essay format. In particular, these are creators who both utilise critical theory, social theory, and philosophy while also producing videos that are entertaining and accessible. They also make the types of videos that leave you feeling like more questions have been opened than answered. Which, especially on YouTube, is an increasingly rare&nbsp;thing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bq3SdfzcA4\">Griftonomics: Why Scams Are Everywhere Now</a> by Tom&nbsp;Nicholas</p>\n\n<p>This video might be Nicholas’s magnum opus, and it feels more like a digital documentary than it does a traditional video essay with a runtime of almost two hours. But he earns every minute of the video by not only exploring the growing phenomenon of digital grifters, but by showing how the logic of grifters exists in an ongoing dialectical relationship with the larger economic structures in our world. In this way he arrives at the logical core of the modern digital grifter, and shows how this same logic is at the heart of much of modern culture. He balances this out by also exploring the psychological factors that have made grifter scams and content so popular. Nicholas also deserves credit for working a level of theatricality into this video (and all of his videos) that’s visually engaging without being distracting. In a world of sad ex-grad students making videos about capitalism ruining our world, Nicholas is the relatable and entertaining lad that takes you just as deep without any performative&nbsp;nihilism.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-hOpY-bFY\">What Red Pill Philosophy Gets Wrong</a> by Then <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Now</p>\n\n<p>2023 was a banner year for content made by reactionary young men utilising various philosophical and political ideas to justify a sense of growing alienation. While it’s easy to dismiss this contingent of creators completely, the harder task is to engage with these trends, openly interrogating their ideological core. And this video does an exemplary job at this task, taking red pill philosophy to task, and in the process, exposing how it offers a shallow simulacrum of actual philosophical responses to complex social problems. The video acknowledges the alienating cultural conditions that produce the “manosphere” while exposing the illogical core at the heart of these ideas. In doing so, Then <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Now has created a video that pushes the viewer to not simply dismiss the modern reactionary, but to understand the logic of this movement, and see how this manner of thinking is more common than we might realise. Ultimately, it’s a video that skillfully uses seemingly esoteric and academic ideas to re-frame the contemporary crisis of masculinity while showing us all why we should&nbsp;care.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhlSgE1dkDc\">the parasite class is killing us.</a> by Alice Capelle<br>\n<br>\nIn this video, Alice Capelle uses the logic of vampire capitalism to show how the modern digital economy increasingly depends on acts of parasitism. She shows how the type of parasitic class relationships exemplified in Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite is replicated in digital spaces, and in particular, among self-styled business gurus using YouTube videos as a way to repeat the logic of class exploitation in the guise of self-help and business advice. Like most of Capelle’s work, this video utilises her ability to synthesise a French brand of critical social theory with an English-language based digital cultural space. This video feels like a sort of ethnography of the contemporary digital parasite, one that both exposes the exploitative core of their content, while hopefully encouraging us to undermine this logic however we&nbsp;can.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"ross\">Julian&nbsp;Ross</a></h3>\n\n<p>Assistant professor, Leiden University, and film&nbsp;programmer</p>\n\n<p>Ross’s recommendations were submitted without&nbsp;comment.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZH6_C7omxM\">El juicio</a> by Ulises de la Orden<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28753636/\">Dau:añcut // Moving Along Image</a> by Adam&nbsp;Piron</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/us/films/silence-of-reason\">Silence of Reason</a> by Kumjana&nbsp;Novakova</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.maryamtafakory.com/mast-del\">Mast-del</a> by Maryam&nbsp;Tafakory</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/us/films/limitation\">Limitation</a> by Elene Asatiani, Soso&nbsp;Dumbadze</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bo-wang.net/an-asian-ghost-story.html\">An Asian Ghost Story</a> by Bo&nbsp;Wang</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/8518\">Still Film</a> by James N.

I chose it from our 2023 video articles because of how it uses a formally simple concept to stage a deep dive into a range of scholarly projects. This is a co-authored video article sharing the research of five academics, who not only speak to the camera about their work but also interact physically with various objects on a sparse kind of set. It is elegantly produced and designed to examine “the personal and intellectual contexts (peri) surrounding academics and their biographies (bio) through audio-visual representation&nbsp;(photy).”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/gb/films/the-world-like-a-jewel-in-the-hand\">The World like a Jewel in the Hand</a> by Ariella&nbsp;Azoulay</p>\n\n<p>This film is technically from 2022 (I don’t know which month), but since this is my first Sight and Sound poll, I have decided to include it. As far as I can tell, it has primarily been screened in 2023. In the film, scholar Ariella Aïsha Azoulay explores the complex history of colonialism between Algeria and Israel, with an emphasis on the gradual erasure of the important figure of the Arab Jew. Azoulay manages to put this history in the broader context of European colonialism in Africa and to interrogate the ongoing practices of colonial museums, all through the simple action of touching and talking about a wide array of books, photographs, mezuzot, and other objects on her desk. When I first saw this film, I immediately felt that it brings an extraordinary depth and power to the concept of the “desktop&nbsp;documentary.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://larissasansour.com/Familiar-Phantoms-2023\">Familiar Phantoms</a> by Larissa Sansour and Søren&nbsp;Lind</p>\n\n<p>I have to confess that I have not seen this film, only the trailer. I recently got a chance to see In the Future They Ate from the Finest Porcelain (2016) and In Vitro (2019) by the same creators. One of the challenges in selecting the “best” video essays from a given year is that so much videographic thought still takes place within the economy of fine arts and is therefore not made available online because it would thereby lose its aura. Larissa Sansour is a Palestinian video artist and filmmaker whose work is powerfully situated and discussed in Gil Z. Hochberg’s book, Becoming Palestine. I am including Familiar Phantoms on my list of selections as the 2023 video work I most wish to&nbsp;see.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p0rya/?hl=en\">A Short Film About Stealing (in Norway)</a> by Pouria&nbsp;Kazemi</p>\n\n<p>I have been able to find very little about Pouria Kazemi online and nothing about this film, which I had the chance to watch when it was submitted to a video festival I co-curated. This short animated video essay is a perfectly composed, brilliantly understated autobiographical statement about the necessity of petty theft under late capitalism. Among the more delightful and poignant touches is that the author’s friends, to protect their anonymity, are given as pseudonyms the names of the Norwegian royal&nbsp;family.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CmBM_gcP1fF/\">Hold On, This Matilda Musical Snapping 💀💀</a> by&nbsp;@wonder_kidd</p>\n\n<p>Hold On, This Matilda Musical Snapping was a TikTok / Instagram trend in which a scene of dynamic choreography from the movie version of the musical Matilda is overlaid by various alternative musical tracks. While putting forward a 25-second social media remix as one of the best video essays of the year is certainly pushing the limits of the form, all the key elements are there: a creative and incisive juxtaposition of a video track with a distinct audio track is contextualised by the critical commentary of a textual annotation. The version I have chosen to link uses @wonder_kidd’s remix of Beyonce’s ‘Cuff It’, a choice that (as many of the Instagram commenters noted) effectively brings out the black cultural roots of Ellen Kane’s choreography, in sharp relief against the massively predominant whiteness of the British schoolchildren who perform it. In just a few seconds, this remix gives us both a snapping new version of Matilda and a cultural critique of how black dance knowledges circulate in predominantly white cultural&nbsp;fields.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"strucci\">Shannon&nbsp;Strucci</a></h3>\n\n<p>Video essayist at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/struccimovies\">StrucciMovies</a>, actual play host on Oddity&nbsp;Roadshow</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkLzC1M7xww\">Colleen Ballinger and Commentary Culture</a> by Ro&nbsp;Ramdin</p>\n\n<p>Ro Ramdin’s work is incredible. Always sharply written, insightful, very funny, beautifully shot, and deeply thoughtful under the meticulous aesthetic and entertaining editing style. She’s one of those essayists I am more than happy to watch even if I have zero interest in the subject matter. I chose this video of hers in particular because I found her reflection on her place in the commentary channel ecosystem navigating the “algorithmic nightmare” of YouTube (as she puts it) especially&nbsp;compelling.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgES_Oj6-tQ\">Does Fresh Garlic Actually Taste Better than Garlic in a Jar?</a> by Ethan&nbsp;Chlebowski</p>\n\n<p>Ethan Chlebowski has made several videos posing the question of whether more expensive versions of the same ingredient are worth it and why, including on balsamic vinegar, olive oil, parmigiano reggiano, vanilla, and, here, garlic. Each video is a deep dive on the cultural history of how the food is used and why, the basics of the culinary science behind it, and Chlebowski doing several taste tests and then giving recommendations at varying price points. While some of his conclusions are down to personal preference, his videos are nevertheless fascinating and done without judgement or pretension. I’d consider them a must-watch for new home cooks or those looking for a great example of engaging educational content that doesn’t&nbsp;condescend.</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"slice_articles\" data-paragraph-id=\"a3c815c6-8270-4e43-b2d7-46dddf029a8e\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"719479\" data-paragraph-type=\"video_embed\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6lOY-Xx1yw\">Wayfinding Flight Rising Dailies <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Accessibility</a> by <span class=\"caps\">PSJ</span>ulie</p>\n\n<p>I started a Neopets account in elementary school, over twenty years ago. My interest in Neopets or other pet sim sites has long since waned but I’m still fascinated by the work of Pet Simmer Julie, who crafts in-depth videos on virtual pet games. Her depth of knowledge and passion for these games and communities is immediately evident with any of her videos. This video, for example, helped me understand my own problems navigating real-world attractions that had poor wayfinding, and I’ve thought back to it many times after&nbsp;watching.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"tafoya\">Scout&nbsp;Tafoya</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/honorszombiefilms\">Filmmaker</a>, author, video essayist,&nbsp;critic</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/833149389\">Practices of Viewing: Description</a> by Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</p>\n\n<p>A perfect capper to Johannes’ indispensable&nbsp;series</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://trailersfromhell.com/its-a-zabriskie-point-sneak-peek/\">It’s a Zabriskie, Zabriskie, Zabriskie, Zabriskie Point</a> by Daniel&nbsp;Kremer</p>\n\n<p>Daniel finally makes his epic, a great odyssey about why we get lost in&nbsp;movies.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/841294355\">Against Polish or, Notes on Videographic Labor or, You Could Remix Blazing Saddles Today</a> by Will&nbsp;DiGravio</p>\n\n<p>With the insouciance of late Godard or Leos Carax’s New Order music video, Will disassembles our need to&nbsp;assemble.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-quP3u9zYU\">Ozu Without Ozu</a> by Green and&nbsp;Red</p>\n\n<p>Deliciously busy exploration of&nbsp;auteurism.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/39-shots\">Once upon a Screen: The 39 Shots</a> by Ariel&nbsp;Avissar</p>\n\n<p>A recontextualisation of what’s in plain&nbsp;sight.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/HAAl3vXHWLs?si=etT2tvEUAoBkmLYd\">Random Acts of Flyness Season 2</a> by Terence&nbsp;Nance</p>\n\n<p>Terence and co’s vibrant and deeply necessary attack on commerce and media’s hideous parasitic relationship is an inspiration to all creators.

Why’d that happen? If we can’t explain why, maybe we can at least reproduce the effect, but with all the tools out in the open. And that’s what this essay does. After a forensics of the recut itself and a cataloguing of the reactions, a little zoom and slow motion unexpectedly imbue me with the same fascination with wonder and impermanence for contemporary online&nbsp;culture.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MUEXGaxFDA\">The <span class=\"caps\">AI</span> Revolution Is Rotten to the Core</a> by Jimmy&nbsp;McGee</p>\n\n<p>This is ground zero of visual culture now, and most of us are either too tired to catch up or hoping it’ll just go away. If you don’t know where to turn, turn here. It’s rigorously researched, historically grounded, theoretically canny, sardonically wise, and as quotable as Casablanca. “We need to choose between building a world for money to live in or building a world for people to live&nbsp;in.”</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"trocan\">Irina&nbsp;Trocan</a></h3>\n\n<p>Freelance <a href=\"https://www.filmsinframe.com/en/interviews/interview-irina-trocan/\">film critic</a>, film studies lecturer at <a href=\"https://scenaristicafilmologie.ro/en/staff/\"><span class=\"caps\">UNATC</span>&nbsp;Bucharest</a></p>\n\n<p>In retrospect, I seem to have compiled a mostly glum list, if not directly referring to contemporary events, at least haunted by&nbsp;them:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sanaz-sohrabi.com/scenes-of-extraction\">Scenes of Extraction</a> by Sanaz&nbsp;Sohrabi</p>\n\n<p>This installation work surveys the history of Iran over several decades, focusing on oil extraction by the foreign company soon to be known as British Petroleum, through a technique called reflection seismography. The challenge, of course, as postcolonial scholarship taught us, is to look beyond the audiovisual self-representation of the company – and the artist accomplishes this extraordinarily well. A voiceover accompanies a collage/montage documenting industrial processes, while the collage in itself operates on the images – which sometimes look like spectral cutouts – workers disconnected from the background, initially black, that slowly takes shape behind them), while at other times these images show their age (for instance, when 1930s maps are juxtaposed with recent <span class=\"caps\">CGI</span>).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB5WVLyADoc\">Between Revolutions</a> by Vlad&nbsp;Petri</p>\n\n<p>Films about revolutions often – and quite paradoxically – treat the event like a solidly contained point on the historical axis, with a beginning and an end, missing exactly their transformative potential and their collective character. One way to avoid this is to resort to the not-entirely-manipulable archives from the depicted era (and not just in short clips to lend the veneer of truth to fictional reenactments), and Between Revolutions is a pretty convincing demonstration of this strategy. Maria and Zahra are fictional med students from Romania and Iran, trying to figure out life amid social turmoil – but the footage, poems and songs that illustrate their journey existed in the world long before the making of this film, and even when made with obvious artistic or educational intent (not to mention elaborate choreography!), these reworked materials contain some trace or emotional truth of their&nbsp;times.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.unifrance.org/movie/56209/this-is-the-end\">This Is the End</a> by Vincent&nbsp;Dieutre</p>\n\n<p>By the most expansive definition a “videographic” work, Dieutre’s Los Angeles pandemic film has, I would argue, a family resemblance with Thom Andersen’s survey of polysemic Californian cityscapes. Love, longing and poetry readings (with actors’/directors’ cameos!) interrupt the grim silence of&nbsp;lockdown.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kortfilm.be/en/watch/she-asked-me-where-i-was\">She Asked Me Where I Was From</a> by Aulona&nbsp;Fetahaj</p>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.kortfilm.be/en/watch/she-asked-me-where-i-was\">reviewed this short film</a> for&nbsp;Kortfilm.be.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://indielisboa.com/en/film/incident/\">Incident</a> by Bill&nbsp;Morrison</p>\n\n<p>Bill Morrison is known to be interested in film only when it is analogue and beautifully degraded, and in this respect the <span class=\"caps\">CCTV</span>/bodycam-sourced Incident is a long distance from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/734548266\">Buried News</a>. The killing of Harith Augustus by the Chicago police was previously examined by Forensic Architecture to persuasively oppose the authorities’ version of the event, but Morrison and Jamie Kalven at the Invisible Institute set out to do something else. The 30-minute film, often showing in split-screen multiple angles and parallel events, only tracks a short span of time, although 1) it seems dispiritingly endless and 2) it already anticipates the community’s reaction to seeing yet another African American killed, while the policemen, in an onlooker’s phrasing, “get their story straight”. Augustus’s lifeless body is present in the frame for a long stretch of the runtime, contrary to the <span class=\"caps\">CPD</span>’s attempt to erase the “accident” from memory, while the eloquent rage of everyone in the community seems tragically rehearsed in similar prior events. The victim’s neighbours don’t get to express solidarity, but the colleagues of the policemen who fired the gun can, and do, help erase criminal&nbsp;guilt.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/e6cd089c-4c04-4903-8bd9-91b78e78ffaf/makeover-movie/\">Makeover Movie</a> by Sue&nbsp;Ding</p>\n\n<p>You’d think this is the second-oldest topic in the feminist book (immediately after suffrage), but makeovers seem here to stay. Just look at what the too-radical teen in Barbie has to go through, or scroll down any social media app on a new account. Luckily, well-informed critiques, spanning many decades of <span class=\"caps\">US</span> films, and listing all the problematic tropes implicit in the “makeover” are also competing for our attention. I can only hope that more young spectators see “The Makeover Movie”, where Sue Ding conjures a multiracial telephone slumber party with her girlfriends to understand how these films taught them “not only how to be a woman, but also how to be American”. Teen classics provide most material, but a handful of musicals plus Desplechin’s A Christmas Tale and Vertigo also fit the&nbsp;bill.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/828945268\">Screen Stars Dictionary.

Therefore, I owe Veronika and Jiří many thanks and a loud high-five for allowing me to mention her again as a media scholar in my 30s.

Kienitz&nbsp;Wilkins</p>\n\n<p>The latest film by James N. Kienitz Wilkins is an intriguing and exhausting audio play voiced by the director, who plays the four main characters in a court inquiry about film memories, film still photographers, Kodak as a pharmaceutical enterprise, the negative aura of Tom Hanks, boom operators, and the elusiveness of Hollywood as a cultural agent. All of this is put together with a seemingly random selection of film stills. As usual, in Kienitz Wilkins’ work, discourse is moving and images are&nbsp;ecstatic.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://maximemartinot.com/le-film-que-vous-allez-voir\">Le film que vous allez voir</a> by Maxime&nbsp;Martinot</p>\n\n<p>Maxime Martinot’s 11-minute film is an immensely funny compilation of disclaimer cards presented at the beginning of films throughout history. Edited as a frantic accumulation of non-images, we expect the worst and suffer the anticipation of immoral, violent, or graphic images. Without the images themselves, we are left with an essay on morality and sensibility as they evolve through time and shape the way we see the world around us and&nbsp;ourselves.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.film-documentaire.fr/4DACTION/w_fiche_film/66783_0\">Où en êtes-vous, Tsai Ming-Liang?</a> by Tsai&nbsp;Ming-Liang</p>\n\n<p>A 20-minute meditation by the greatest living filmmaker on back pain, the pleasure of sitting, the beauty of chairs and how to paint&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mk2films.com/en/film/room-999/\">Chambre 999</a> by Lubna&nbsp;Playoust</p>\n\n<p>A conceptual remake of Wim Wenders’ Chambre 666, made 40 years later. Cinema has changed, and today’s issues concerning viewership, distribution, and production are radically different from those of 1982. An uneven collection of thoughts that includes a wonderful opening act by Wenders himself as a burlesque doomsday&nbsp;prophet.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/pt/pt/films/where-is-pessoa\">Onde está o Pessoa? (Where is Pessoa?)</a> by Leonor&nbsp;Areal</p>\n\n<p>From a few minutes of film, shot in 1913, Leonor Areal loops, zooms, pans, and examines every detail (as in Ken Jacobs’ Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son), looking for the poet Fernando Pessoa, who was a cinephile, designed the logo of a movie company, wrote several film scripts, and was never caught on film.

A good recap doesn’t just communicate plot, but also the point of the essay; this does both. Excellent pacing and vocal delivery communicates the tone of the map, and becomes a jumping off point for an analysis of horror in gaming / the oft-discussed topic of liminal spaces. And, a special shoutout to an almost unedited six-minute segment of black and silence in the middle. Commitment to the&nbsp;bit!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV8BnxuPF2Y\">Cinema in Pain: Decoding “Mad God”</a> by James&nbsp;DeLisio</p>\n\n<p>Interrogating one of the strangest releases of last year, this essay takes on the unenviable task of articulating how the film articulates the inarticulable (via Elaine Scarry). DeLisio’s commentary includes text elements that are ingeniously expressed in a similar visual language to the film’s (faded, grainy, blurry). As commenter Max Tohline puts it, “not under the knife of Scarry, but in coequal conversation with&nbsp;Scarry”.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoVIjjD3Os4\">Is It Impossible to Dad?</a> by The&nbsp;Nukes</p>\n\n<p>A trademark The Nukes / Josh Geist essay in its analysis of a throwaway family animation property through a serious academic viewpoint – not (just) for the comedy of applying highbrow to lowbrow, but to recognise that even (and maybe especially?) the forgotten parts of pop culture express truths about humanity. Josh reorders his text via its characters’ viewpoints to tell a story about father-son communication – and, perhaps, the impossibility of communication&nbsp;itself.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuaDbu_VBLY\">Everything Is Sludge: Art in the Post-Human Era</a> by Lily&nbsp;Alexandre</p>\n\n<p>Alexandre investigates ‘sludge’ content – those splitscreens of a narrated reddit post and a Subway Surfers video, for instance – through a clever visual device. Talk about ‘embodied practice’: hard for me to imagine a more clear example than Alexandre projecting the edited video text onto their own body for the entirety of this video. An interruption a few minutes in from YouTube’s algorithm –a split-screen beer advert no less– just added to the gag on my viewing. And throughout the to-camera presentation, I found my eye drawn off to the Minecraft parkour constantly, in a clever proving of Alexandre’s argument. Behind the overstimulating presentation, Alexandre’s analysis offers an insightful categorisation of a media type inexplicable on the surface but ever-present in the developing digital&nbsp;landscape.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Vlu-Ffdxocc?si=4vunJSQgj2dgdkBh\">The Man/Car Gender Binary in John Carpenter’s Christine</a> by max&nbsp;teeth</p>\n\n<p>The breezy recap of the man/car binary in the opening moments of max teeth’s essay is authoritative, funny, and thought-provoking – everything a video essay can be, especially on YouTube. And the speed with which that’s just assumed and dropped as we speed into the main matter is a great example of how to explain succinctly.

Seinpeaks illustrates the fine line beautifully. It’s a long-running project mashing up Twin Peaks and Seinfeld (with guest appearances from other stalwart shows like Always Sunny and Friends). These two shows aired simultaneously and their shared visual language provides a jumping-off point for a surprising collab that draws out the humour in Twin Peaks and the absurdism in&nbsp;Seinfeld.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"woodward\">Adam&nbsp;Woodward</a></h3>\n\n<p>Editor-at-large and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@lwlies\">YouTube channel</a> manager at <a href=\"https://lwlies.com/\">Little White Lies&nbsp;magazine</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrXFHUW5Uk\">How Jane Campion Subverts the Violence of the Male Gaze</a> by Carly&nbsp;Mattox</p>\n\n<p>This was an idea pitched to me around focusing on the image of the woman on the street in cinema, especially at night, and especially in films directed by women. It took a little bit of back and forth to nail the structure and pacing, but the tone and central thesis of the piece was rock solid from the outset.

A work of art that redefines the boundaries of what’s possible in the medium. Its richness, originality, and creativity combine to create an experience that truly blows the mind. This videographic project is a testament to the limitless potential of form, its academic rigour, and artistry. It’s a visual and intellectual rollercoaster that will leave you in awe from start to&nbsp;finish.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://criticalcommons.org/view?m=Twhjate9p\"><span class=\"caps\">RAWR</span> </a>by Maud&nbsp;Ceuterick</p>\n\n<p>Beginning as a creative spark in an Aarhus workshop, it expanded at Middlebury College to become a true gem. Drawing from Judith Butler’s groundbreaking work, Ceuterick passionately interprets and deforms scenes of female rage, challenging gender norms. This transformative journey echoes Audre Lorde’s call for a radical change through the expression of rage. It’s a brilliant fusion of scholarship and&nbsp;creativity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://62c94e7dc27d5.site123.me/\">This is Not What I Normally Do: An Insignificant Step in the Downfall of the Humanities</a> by Ariel&nbsp;Avissar</p>\n\n<p>This is <span class=\"caps\">THE</span> video essay of the year. A bold departure from convention, this video defies expectations with its remarkable layers of provocation. Meticulously edited and expertly crafted, it pushes the boundaries of videographic criticism, skilfully weaving a captivating tapestry of thought-provoking insights in the&nbsp;field</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/816886504\">Sound Before Picture </a>by Cormac&nbsp;Donnelly</p>\n\n<p>One of the most captivating sound projects I’ve ever encountered. This video essay ventures into uncharted territory, pairing the audio from the beginning of films with the closing images, creating an extraordinary mosaic of sound and visuals. The result is an auditory and visual tapestry that defies conventional expectations. It’s a seamless blend of the familiar and the unexpected, challenging our perception of film&nbsp;narratives.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/830585666\">169 Seconds: Una mujer reflejada / A Reflected Woman</a> by Catherine&nbsp;Grant</p>\n\n<p>In this brief but profoundly impactful exploration, Catherine Grant manages to distil the essence of the film’s themes, performances, and significance with remarkable precision, a testament to the art of succinct and effective storytelling. It’s a research gem that demonstrates the power of brevity in conveying complex ideas. In just 169 seconds, this video essay is the best piece of research ever “written” on Sebastián Lelio’s&nbsp;film.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/lacurieo\">Xena’s Body: A Menstrual Auto-Investigation Using an iPhone</a> by Occitane&nbsp;Lacurie</p>\n\n<p>This provocative video essay skillfully employs desktop editing on an iPhone to present a feminist perspective on the enduring control of women’s bodies through the dissemination of misinformation about menstruation and the menstruation apps.

An intriguing title, with a clearly stressed-out person and also The Binding of Isaac in the thumbnail? What’s going on? Within one minute the purpose becomes clear; this woman who has very strong opinions and credentials will break down exactly what happened with the String Theory phenomenon while simultaneously stumbling through a playthrough of the vintage roguelike indie darling Binding of Isaac. A premise so absurd and hilarious (dare I say groundbreaking?) that you instantly want to watch and listen. It’s very informative and <span class=\"caps\">HIGHLY</span> entertaining for the joke of the idea alone. I’m glad this took off because it was worth it.

They graduated from Le Fresnoy in 2023. In an exploratory mode, they approach water as a substance that influences the territories it flows through and the bodies that live in it. Taking a poetic, documentary approach, they make the experience of otherness a condition of artistic creation. The camera eye acts as a catalyst for encounters, while questioning the human gestures that shape materials and&nbsp;territories.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of a mesh of viewpoints and disciplines (craft techniques, geology, chemistry, marine biology, etc.) and at the crossroads of sculpture and cinema, they are interested in the origin of the materials that form a landscape. Recently, their research has led them to question more specifically the complementarities between learned form and sensitive form, working with scientists on objects generated by their cutting edge technologies.

I was lucky enough to see May’s practice first hand at Embodying the Video Essay, a videographic workshop in Maine this summer and was blown away by May’s spectacularly intricate and layered work.

I’ve found her in the comment sections of countless videos writing detailed notes that reflect her care and close attention to everything she watches.

She’s a French creator making videos in English, often about topics and phenomena specific to English language digital spaces and culture. This perspective allows her to use the critical force of a French leftist theorist to tackle seemingly vapid and conceptually empty trends and practices. At other times, she’s able to translate the specificity of the French political moment to a broader audience in a way that’s far more accessible than standard news&nbsp;coverage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@SkipIntroYT\">Jackson Maher </a>(nominated by Michael <span class=\"caps\">O’N</span>eill&nbsp;Burns)</p>\n\n<p>Jackson is an already accomplished editor who in recent years has put himself in front of the camera to create video essays that lure viewers in with analysis of popular media properties, but uses this as the occasion to expose deeper cultural ideologies buried within pop culture. His series of videos on Copaganda does a masterful job at showing us how the logic of policing has infected so much of our culture, down to popular children’s programme Paw Patrol. But maybe most impressively, Jackson does all this while being relatable and curious, never making the viewer feel judged but instead inviting us to dig deeper alongside&nbsp;him.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/-aRSLSAzbI8?si=HzPnuI05Lo8CfK7r\">Lara Isobel Callaghan</a> (nominated by Will&nbsp;Webb)</p>\n\n<p>Lara is a new face on the video-essay scene, with a number of commissions across Little White Lies and the <span class=\"caps\">BFI</span>. Although the commissioned work is excellent, I’m highlighting this video from the Essay Library collab, When Essay Met Library, due to its formal inventiveness and cheeky sense of humour. Using Hindi film Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan as a jumping off point, Lara examines Shakespeare’s influence on the rom-com genre through the lens of a 1980s infomercial.

data-paragraph-type=\"newsletter_signup\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p>Now in its seventh annual edition, the Sight and Sound poll for the best video essays of the year surveys the online sphere, film festivals and audiovisual research in almost equal measure. Its primary purposes are to mark notable works and keep track of the various schools of thought concerning what video essays can or should be, and how they can communicate to a range of&nbsp;audiences.</p>\n\n<p>The poll was conducted with the assistance of 48 voters from 17 countries, including academics, critics, online creators and festival curators. Together, their 260 nominations include 181 distinct titles. Given the scope and abundance of recent video essays, even an extensive poll can only provide a cross-section of the topics, forms and rhetoric of their contemporary practice – a limitation many voters noted in their submissions. Of the nominated works, 47% were created by male video essayists, 39% by female, with several from non-binary creators and mixed teams. Around two-thirds feature voiceover, with the majority presented in English, although 14 languages feature in the overall&nbsp;poll.</p>\n\n<p>The nominations saw a relatively equal split between essays created for YouTube and those created for academic research, with 50 YouTube and 47 academic videos (or entire series). Publicly available videos’ viewership varies broadly, from 9.5 million views (for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5wAo54DHDY0?si=64cLsJYtzrCSlIXg\">MyHouse.wad</a>) to the low double digits; participants were keen to highlight new and underseen works as well as celebrating the achievements of established creators. Festival films or installation pieces also proved popular, with 53 arthouse shorts, features and documentaries nominated. Also present, although in a smaller proportion, were self-published Vimeo works or collaborative projects unaffiliated with a specific institution. However, within the yearly <span class=\"caps\">S&amp;S</span> poll for video essays, there seems to be a slight decline both in independently produced and published Vimeo content, and in video output by cinephile magazines, while the academic sector is slowly but constantly&nbsp;expanding.</p>\n\n<p>The average runtime was 27 minutes, with most around the 15 minute mark – although a few marathon nominations like Will DiGravio’s <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/841294355\">Against Polish</a> and Adam Curtis’ <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0d3hwl1/russia-19851999-traumazone\">TraumaZone</a> (three and seven hours respectively) stick out. Three videos were one minute long or&nbsp;shorter.</p>\n\n<p>Leading the nominations, Maryam Tafakory and Johannes Binotto tie for 10 nominations, with Tafakory’s split-screen work <a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste\">chaste/unchaste</a> and Binotto’s <a href=\"https://blog.hslu.ch/videoessay/johannes-binotto-practices-of-viewing-description/\">Practices</a> <a href=\"https://blog.hslu.ch/videoessay/johannes-binotto-practices-of-viewing-color/\">of</a> <a href=\"https://blog.hslu.ch/videoessay/practices-viewing-distance/\">Viewing</a> series coming out on top. <a href=\"https://www.ahistoryoftheworldaccordingtogettyimages.com/\">A History of the World According to Getty Images</a> by Richard Misek received nine nominations, the most for a single work. Returning essayists of note include Chloé Galibert-Laîné, Barbara Zecchi and Ariel Avissar, while new entrants with multiple nominations include Occitane Lacurie (three noms for Xena’s Body: A Menstrual Auto-Investigation Using an iPhone) and James DeLisio (four nominations for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wV8BnxuPF2Y?si=WFcpR127IAGAFaEW\">Cinema in Pain: Decoding “Mad God”</a>).</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that some videos appear in consecutive polls: among them, Misek’s History of the World According to Getty Images and Galibert-Laîné’s <a href=\"https://www.chloegalibertlaine.com/geomarkr\">GeoMarkr</a> are now available online, while in <a href=\"/sight-and-sound/polls/best-video-essays-2022\">the 2022 poll</a> they were occasionally mentioned, but less widely seen. It is often the case that videos travel in festivals or are viewed in conferences and among peers before being made public. While the current poll has several dozen videos to which we cannot presently direct our readers, we hope that in the near future many will be similarly available with unrestricted&nbsp;access.</p>\n\n<p>Videographic collaborations make up a number of nominations in this years’ list. <a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/journal-videographic-film-moving-image-studies-94-2023\">Once upon a Screen: Vol. 2</a>, edited by Avissar and Evelyn Kreutzer, returns with two nominations for its second instalment. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/9576546\">Moving Poems</a>, also curated by Kreutzer, received five nominations, chiefly for Desiree de Jesus’ a raisin in the sun. And the <a href=\"https://www.16-9.dk/kategori/media/\">169 Seconds</a> series, commissioned by Danish journal 16:9 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, received three nominations, including returning essayists Catherine Grant and Jason Mittell. Independent videographic community <a href=\"https://theessaylibrary.com/\">The Essay Library</a> also features with one nomination for Lara Callaghan’s contribution to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzHhdsb5LkA\">When Essay Met Library</a> collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>A number of essays were published through new academic journals, including Zeitschrift für Medienwissenschaft with five videos nominated; other new entrants include Teknokultura and Feminist Media Histories. [in]Transition, Tecmerin and <span class=\"caps\">NECSUS</span> are by now certified in making the works they publish visible among videographic&nbsp;researchers.</p>\n\n<p>Independent streaming service <a href=\"https://nebula.tv/\">Nebula</a> has continued to grow its base of creators, many of whom are video essayists. Out of 50 unique YouTube videos, seven were also published on Nebula. Three of these were directly cross-posted, another three were Nebula First (published earlier than YouTube), and one nomination – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIwwJGhbDb8\">We Must Destroy What the Bomb Cannot</a> by Big Joel – was a Nebula Plus video, meaning it includes extra content beyond what is available on YouTube. Lily Alexandre’s Nebula-first essay <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OuaDbu_VBLY?si=YMVVLrvetpI1Dmtx\">Everything Is Sludge: Art in the Post-Human Era</a> received three nods, bringing the total number of Nebula nominations up to&nbsp;nine.</p>\n\n<p>Billed as a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/streaming/news/nebula-ceo-dave-wiskus-interview-1235782591/\">creator-first streaming service</a>, Nebula aims to give its creators the freedom that they cannot find on YouTube. Many video essayists have joined Nebula after finding their work coming up against YouTube’s advertiser-friendly guidelines, restricting the discussion of mature topics. In February 2023, Maggie Mae Fish launched her series <a href=\"https://nebula.tv/unrated\">Unrated</a> exploring sexuality in film, and Broey Deschanel followed suit in November with the <a href=\"https://nebula.tv/taboo\">Taboo on Screen</a> series. There’s an oft-noted divide between ‘Vimeo-style’ essays –&nbsp;with their more academic leaning and longer clip length – and YouTube essays – with their quick cuts and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tonyszhou/postmortem-1b338537fabc\">careful stepping around automatic copyright claims</a>. This gap may be quickly closing, although whether a Nebula style will arise remains to be&nbsp;seen.</p>\n\n<p>Although content creators can make money through AdSense and sponsorships on YouTube, many turn to community donations and subscriptions to fund their work. Forty-one of the nominated YouTube works included a link to Patreon, Ko-fi or PayPal in the video description. One nominated video, Brad Troemel’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sXYV-VUPneA?si=NOAXouLQBjMVTWGj\">The Literalists</a>, is available exclusively on Patreon, with only a trailer uploaded to&nbsp;YouTube.</p>\n\n<p>Vimeo essayists have also encountered in greater force the problems that have plagued YouTube essayists for years. Formerly a safe haven for video essays containing copyrighted materials, Vimeo has enacted a slew of copyright claims, viewing restrictions and takedowns on well-known video essays in recent months. This brings to mind Fandor’s 2016/2017 removal of multiple video essays from their channels in response to the threat of copyright claims, ringing alarm bells about the mixed potential of the Internet as an archive for videographic work. The long-running <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/8660446\"><span class=\"caps\">TV</span> Dictionary</a> project is just one example with multiple claims, despite its clear origin in academic research&nbsp;practice.</p>\n\n<p>Nostalgia and memory, pop culture and cinephilia – sometimes mixed together –&nbsp;loom large in this year’s list, due in part to some popular academic series including <a href=\"https://indyvinyl.gla.ac.uk/indy-vinyl-for-the-masses/\">Indy Vinyl for the Masses</a> (curated by Ian Garwood) and the <a href=\"https://tecmerin.uc3m.es/project/screen-stars-dictionary/?lang=en\">Screen Stars Dictionary</a> (curated by Tecmerin and Ariel Avissar). Gender as spectacle makes its appearance in several videos, from the mainstream end of the spectrum (max teeth’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlu-Ffdxocc&amp;ab_channel=maxteeth\">The Man/Car Gender Binary in John Carpenter’s Christine</a>) to critical discussions of star personae, cinema’s archetypal female protagonists as well as filmmaking/media practices (Morgane Frund’s short films, among other titles), to direct references to Laura Mulvey and Judith Butler at the other&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n<p>As with all other areas of discourse this year, <span class=\"caps\">AI</span> featured in multiple videos, usually more as a thematic concern than as a videographic tool (although text-to-speech and some generative techniques feature in the list). Futurism more generally, whether dystopian or utopian, was a common theme in the YouTube&nbsp;nominations.</p>\n\n<p>Interrogation of the video essay form itself continues to stimulate discussion within the field, including the drawing to a close of Johannes Binotto’s popular Practices of Viewing series. While this self-reflexivity was <a href=\"/sight-and-sound/polls/best-video-essays-2021\">first noted in the 2021 poll</a>, it was seen more on YouTube in 2023, with videos ranging from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/t41M_E7BvDo?si=_-BKe5YuveA7jveS\">assessing the state of the video essay landscape</a> to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sEEBKbCvDJE?si=caP9Ha_aIIOjHUZ8\">dispensing advice about how to be a successful video essayist</a>. Harris Michael Brewis, better known as hbomberguy, released a nearly four-hour <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yDp3cB5fHXQ?si=aR6n5X0sHj65SkWp\">exposé of plagiarism on YouTube</a> with a particular focus on video essays. The video passed two million views within 24 hours of its&nbsp;publication.</p>\n\n<p>While there are certainly great videos that remained unmentioned even with such dedicated teamwork on behalf of all voters, the present survey should be a solid starting point (and, in a few years’ time, a reminder) of the state of video essays in 2023. Thank you to everyone who&nbsp;participated.</p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"voters\">Full list of&nbsp;voters</a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#anger\">Jiří&nbsp;Anger</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#avissar\">Ariel&nbsp;Avissar</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#binotto\">Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#brubaker\">Philip Józef&nbsp;Brubaker</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#carvajal\">Nelson&nbsp;Carvajal</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#chinapen\">Ben&nbsp;Chinapen</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#custodio\">Isabel&nbsp;Custodio</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#digravio\">Will&nbsp;DiGravio</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#dima\">Flavia&nbsp;Dima</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#galibert\">Chloé&nbsp;Galibert-Laîné</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#geller\">Jacob&nbsp;Geller</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#genevicius\">Tomas&nbsp;Genevičius</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#gibbs\">John&nbsp;Gibbs</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#gills\">Libertad&nbsp;Gills</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#grant\">Catherine&nbsp;Grant</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#hofmann\">Maria&nbsp;Hofmann</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#iten\">Oswald&nbsp;Iten</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#jeanneret\">Delphine&nbsp;Jeanneret</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#jude\">Radu&nbsp;Jude</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#kern\">Sam&nbsp;Kern</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#kiss\">Miklós&nbsp;Kiss</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#kooijman\">Jaap&nbsp;Kooijman</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#kreutzer\">Evelyn&nbsp;Kreutzer</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#lacurie\">Occitane&nbsp;Lacurie</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#laird\">Colleen&nbsp;Laird</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#lee\">Kevin B.&nbsp;Lee</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#martin\">Adrian&nbsp;Martin</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#mcilwraith\">Daniel&nbsp;Mcilwraith</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#mcleod\">Dayna&nbsp;McLeod</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#meadows\">Queline&nbsp;Meadows</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#natalio\">Carlos&nbsp;Natálio</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#ogara\">Clare <span class=\"caps\">O’G</span>ara</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#oleary\">Alan <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#burns\">Michael <span class=\"caps\">O’N</span>eill&nbsp;Burns</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#ross\">Julian&nbsp;Ross</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#hinojosa\">José Sarmiento&nbsp;Hinojosa</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#saunders\">Jemma&nbsp;Saunders</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#schindel\">Dan&nbsp;Schindel</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#spatz\">Ben&nbsp;Spatz</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#strucci\">Shannon&nbsp;Strucci</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#tafoya\">Scout&nbsp;Tafoya</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#tohline\">Max&nbsp;Tohline</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#trocan\">Irina&nbsp;Trocan</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#vanau\">Ilinca&nbsp;Vânău</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#lisboa\">Ricardo Vieira&nbsp;Lisboa</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#webb\">Will&nbsp;Webb</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#woodward\">Adam&nbsp;Woodward</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#zecchi\">Barbara&nbsp;Zecchi</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>All the&nbsp;votes</h2>\n\n<h3><a name=\"anger\">Jiří&nbsp;Anger</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://qmul.academia.edu/JiriAnger\">Film theorist, curator, and video essayist</a>, Queen Mary University of London and Národní filmový&nbsp;archiv</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/history-world-according-getty-images\">A History of the World According to Getty Images</a> by Richard&nbsp;Misek</p>\n\n<p>A timely meditation on how even public domain images ‘we all know’ can become unattainable when they find themselves in the thrall of commercial archives and data banks.

By jumping between the indistinct traces of <span class=\"caps\">CLODO</span>, a terrorist group that bombed computer companies in 1980s France, it denies the pretension that the desktop interface is there ‘for us’ to make content readily available and uncovers the fundamental lack and self-destructivity of contemporary visual&nbsp;regimes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtAa7EGFAHk\">Twisties!</a> by Alice&nbsp;Lenay</p>\n\n<p>A fascinating extension of the videographic impulse into a live performance.

It was made under the mentorship of Catherine Grant, as part of a wonderful videographic symposium held in Hanover late last year, where I first got to see it — and was published earlier this year in the ZfM blog Videography, which followed that symposium. Don’t miss it — and also check out her shorter, lovely video, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/866170709\">Wes Anderson’s Trains</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zfmedienwissenschaft.de/en/online/videography-blog/accented-sound-of-camp\">The Accented Sound of Camp</a> by Barbara&nbsp;Zecchi</p>\n\n<p>In another video first presented at the Hanover conference and published this year on the ZfM blog, Zecchi offers a 4-part exploration of the use of Italian accents in Hollywood films. Starting from House of Gucci, it examines various screen representations of Italians and Italian Americans and the political and ideological dimensions of the accented voice (following Zecchi’s<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/680718777\"> previous work</a> on the subject). It is insightful, entertaining and highly inventive, experimenting with a diverse range of videographic techniques and forms of&nbsp;voiceover.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/men-shouting-history-7-episodes\">Men Shouting: A History in 7 Episodes</a> by Alan <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary</p>\n\n<p>One of the explicit inspirations for Zecchi’s video above, <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary’s is a tour de force of parametric criticism, or what he calls a form of “cyborg scholarship”. It is a fascinating and highly generative piece, and remains playful throughout; <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>early must have had a lot of fun while making it, like a child playing with Lego. It would be difficult to explain here just what the video does with its subject material (three narrative films made about the 2008 financial crash); luckily, <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary has already done that himself, in the accompanying creator’s statement, which you should definitely read prior to watching the video if you want any chance of figuring out what the hell is going&nbsp;on!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/847046095\">Moving Poems: A Raisin in the Sun (1961)</a> by Desirée de&nbsp;Jesús</p>\n\n<p>Evelyn Kreutzer’s Moving Poems collection, which pairs poems with moving images, has generated some remarkable works over the past couple of years. This video by de Jesús is one of the standout pieces. It places the 1961 adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun in dialogue with Langston Hughes’s “Harlem”, from which its title was derived. It is an intelligent and complex piece, employing multiple, dense layerings of image, sound and text, and will benefit from repeat viewings. Check it out, as well as the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/9576546\">other pieces in the collection</a> – and consider contributing your&nbsp;own.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/717263620\">Unsteady (for Elisabeth Bronfen)</a> by Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</p>\n\n<p>I will not say much about Binotto’s touching tribute to his former teacher and close friend, Elisabeth Bronfen, who retired from Zurich university this summer. You should simply watch it (all the way to the very end) and&nbsp;smile.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/815110756\">Watching the Rehearsal</a> by Jason&nbsp;Mittell</p>\n\n<p>Why leave scholarship to chance? You’d better watch Nathan Fielder’s The Rehearsal before watching this one; and while you’re at it, watch some of Professor Mittell’s previous pieces, where he established some of the ideas and approaches he’s developed here in elaborate and unexpected ways; specifically,<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/277901900\"> this</a> and<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/142425249\"> this</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.maryamtafakory.com/mast-del\">Mast-del</a> مست دل by Maryam&nbsp;Tafakory</p>\n\n<p>This last one is unfortunately not available for viewing online, and has been making the festival round this past year – go and watch it if you get the chance. Is this a video essay? I don’t know. Here is how Tafakory describes it: “A love song that would never pass through the censors, Mast-del is about forbidden bodies and desires inside and outside post-revolution Iranian cinema.” Anyone who’s seen her previous work (and if you haven’t, you’re missing out), would recognise these themes and ideas that she has dealt with before. Here, she approaches them from a radically different aesthetic, masterfully blending clips from existing films, original footage, a scripted narrative and original score, to mesmerising and moving&nbsp;effect.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"binotto\">Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</a></h3>\n\n<p>Media studies scholar, bricoleur, project leader <a href=\"https://videoessayresearch.org/\">videoessayresearch.org</a></p>\n\n<p>No representative overview, no proper summaries.

It pierces me. Everything in it. The artefacts of the video signal that devour the image, the high pitched hiss of the <span class=\"caps\">TV</span>, the calm and sober voice that speaks of memories which sound innocuous but frighten you, and then the look on this face I recognise and which I have never seen like&nbsp;that.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://necsus-ejms.org/with-a-camera-in-hand-i-was-alive/\">With a Camera in Hand, I Was Alive + Introduction</a> by Katie&nbsp;Bird</p>\n\n<p>“I keep thinking about&nbsp;gestures”.</p>\n\n<p>Katie Bird’s haunting video essay and its bittersweet introduction makes us keep thinking, keep wondering, about the weight and value of labour, of film labour, scholarly labour, of what it means to hold, a camera, a child, a body, yourself, and how we can continue by letting&nbsp;go.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/846426747\">Film Thought 5.

We need to fight a system that is already well ahead in co-opting, privatising, watermarking, and sealing the archives, depriving more and more people of their past, their collective memories.

Scrolling, clicking, touching, feeling through images and associations, a flow of intertexts at the tip of your invisible finger. You better be careful with what you open next. In this one I feel seen by all these bodies, dismembered, scattered, commodified. Looking through the mirror stage and back again. And what about this little screen in my hand?

Within 1 minute the purpose becomes clear; this woman who has very strong opinions and credentials will break down exactly what happened with the String Theory phenomenon while simultaneously stumbling through a playthrough of the vintage roguelike indie darling Binding of Isaac. A premise so absurd and hilarious (dare I say groundbreaking?) that you instantly want to watch and listen.

In fact, he so effectively mocks these aesthetics that his work often goes viral, with choruses of the terminally online taking it, well, literally (a recent post about the unionisation of the Taylor Swift fandom comes to mind). In addition to these posts, he creates video essays outlining his observations of online behaviour. In The Literalists, he takes a look at “millennial cultural liberalism” and the inclination to scrub content clean of any possible offence, connecting the “Satanic Panic” of the 1980s to the modern, flawed reasoning that it is morally bad to watch films with immoral characters. His essays are available exclusively on his Patreon, but it’s well worth at least a month’s subscription to binge them.

She charts the decline of the relatively literal disaster film with the rise of a looming, paralysing belief in our pre-determined doom.

Here’s hoping it might inspire you to give them all a&nbsp;watch.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://online.ucpress.edu/fmh/article/9/4/32/197468/Josephine-Baker-Watches-Herself\">Joséphine Baker Watches Herself</a> by Terri&nbsp;Francis</p>\n\n<p>[3:43] On the left, Joséphine Baker performs in the famous skirt made out of bananas.

And I like difficult films,” says <span class=\"caps\">DJ</span> Black. But if it is bad, “I can’t dub it.” [04:51] An incisive documentary about film culture in&nbsp;Tanzania.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://intermedialites.com/en/new-publication-no-41-sleeping-dormir/\">watch me sleep: self-surveillance and middle-aging queer performance anxiety</a> by Dayna&nbsp;McLeod</p>\n\n<p>There’s a moment in the second minute I felt throughout my whole body.

Perhaps the best zero-budget film in many years — which affords itself the very rare “luxury” of playfully engaging with the legacy of Harun Farocki. You’ll never look at a doorbell with the same eyes after this film, not ever&nbsp;again.</p>\n\n<p>Dear Gerald by Jasper&nbsp;Rigole</p>\n\n<p>Rarely does the perspective of film archivists — with its particular way of looking at film, and its entire universe of both material and ethical dilemmas — actually transpire in film. Jasper Rigole’s short (aside from spotlighting his delightful<a href=\"https://iicadom.org/\"> <span class=\"caps\">IICADOM</span></a> archives, a true goldmine for home movie enthusiasts) does exactly that, while also bringing into question the spectatorship of archival&nbsp;footage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/699982796\">GeoMarkr</a> by Chloé Galibert-Laîné and Guillaume&nbsp;Grandjean</p>\n\n<p>Galibert-Laîné, brilliant as&nbsp;usual.</p>\n\n<p>Bliss.jpg by Emily Rose Apter and Elijah&nbsp;Stevens</p>\n\n<p>Some of the world’s most famous (digital — in all senses of the term) landscapes, reexamined, almost à la Richard Prince, or rather, a y2k take on the method of James Benning — brought back into materiality through 16mm&nbsp;film.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.unifrance.org/film/56547/le-film-que-vous-allez-voir\">The Film You Are About to See</a> by Maxime&nbsp;Martinot</p>\n\n<p>Despite all the hand-wringing in recent years, content warnings are by no means something new to cinema — and the double helix-like structure (going both backwards and forwards throughout the history) of Martinot’s incisive and irreverent short reveals this to the fullest, together with excavating the various mores and taboos that cinema was transgressing at various times in modern&nbsp;history.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.swissfilms.ch/en/movie/les-dieux-du-supermarche/20436371EE784510B4D92133823E62FF\">Gods of the Supermarket</a> by Alberto Gonzalez&nbsp;Morales</p>\n\n<p>I’m a sucker for any and all films that use ‘Wicked Game’ on their soundtrack.

Not only did their films inspire me, but I was moved by all five <span class=\"caps\">Q&amp;A</span> sessions, for very different reasons. This may testify to a growing need for personal connection through videographic practices, in the midst of a media landscape that grows more cluttered and anonymous by the day. I also want to salute the engagement of makers who are committed to accompanying their creations in person and helping them reach an audience, even when economic or political circumstances are not favourable. My list is non&nbsp;hierarchical.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fidmarseille.org/film/artistes-en-zone-troubles-2/\">Artistes en zone troublés</a> by Stéphane Gérard and Lionel&nbsp;Soukaz</p>\n\n<p>Lionel Soukaz’s video diary Journal annales is not only a milestone in the history of French experimental cinema, it is also an essential piece of <span class=\"caps\">LGBTQIA</span>+ heritage. There is something extremely moving about the care and tenderness with which Stéphane Gérard approaches this audiovisual document, as he edits a new short portrait of Soukaz’s late lover Hervé Couergou from the thousands of hours of footage Soukaz shot, making this testimony to the history of the «années sida» and the evolution of the gay movement accessible to a new generation of spectators, artists and&nbsp;activists.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202305376.html\">Ours / Bear</a> by Morgane&nbsp;Frund</p>\n\n<p>A personal exploration of the complex power dynamics between a male filmer and female filmed subjects, when the camera is suddenly turned towards he whose gaze had hitherto remained unchallenged. Frund’s video essay is uncomfortable in the best sense of the word, and leaves its viewers with more questions than answers, providing a starting point for an essential conversation about gender, class and generational differences, and the ethics of&nbsp;documentary.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/ro/films/nobody-was-cool\">Personne n’était sympa / Nobody Was Cool</a> by Hélèna Villovitch and David <span class=\"caps\">TV</span></p>\n\n<p>The film is a moving and hilarious evocation of a walk through the streets of Paris on 1 May 1986, based on the filmmakers’ memories and a wide range of audiovisual archives. Images and sounds are saturated, superimposed, iridescent; facts and fantasies merge in a hallucinatory stream of real and fabricated memories, to which a final twist gives a whole new&nbsp;meaning.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/b5f485c0-8e35-454c-b189-539fc826a417/Dreams-About-Putin/\">Dreams About Putin</a> by Nastia Korkia and Vlad&nbsp;Fishez</p>\n\n<p>Based on a selection of actual dreams that the filmmakers collected online, this essay explores how the figure of Vladimir Putin has crept into the psyches of Russian citizens since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Disturbing, violent, absurd, the dreams are narrated in voice over and accompanied by a visual score created with the 3D graphics program Unreal Engine, interspersed with bizarre and equally absurd archival footage of Putin. A nightmarish response to a nightmarish war, waged both on the frontline and on social&nbsp;media.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk-7dyJ9Vz0\">Non-alignés: Scènes des archives Labudović / Non-Aligned: Scenes from the Labudovic Reels</a> by Mila&nbsp;Turajlic</p>\n\n<p>A portrait of Tito’s official cameraman Stevan Labudović, this feature-length essay film exhumes previously unseen archival footage from the 1961 Belgrade conference to explore the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement. As educational as it is politically sharp, the film accounts for the difficulties faced by Turajlic in working with unprocessed, barely identified archives, and offers Labudović an opportunity to share his personal and often humorous take on this turning point in the history of world&nbsp;politics.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"geller\">Jacob&nbsp;Geller</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@JacobGeller\">YouTube-based video essayist</a> writing about the intersection of games, culture, art, and&nbsp;politics</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OuaDbu_VBLY?si=jN2rYmPX6fdevFYf\">Everything Is Sludge: Art in the Post-Human Era</a> by Lily&nbsp;Alexandre</p>\n\n<p>Alexandre’s dissection of how algorithms are morphing our artistic tastes is insightful and biting. Although viewers may expect a video about <span class=\"caps\">AI</span>, more time is spent on how humans are more than willing to start producing <span class=\"caps\">AI</span>-esque content by hand in order to serve the tastes of their perceived audience. The real star of this video is the production, however. Alexandre speaks as a kaleidoscopic projection of Subway Surfer, minecraft montages, and other “sludge” is projected onto their face. As interesting as the essay’s script is, the viewer’s eye will inevitably slip to the endless stream of meaningless attention-grabbing clips – just as Alexandre intended, I&nbsp;imagine.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/P1la0GBUNB8?si=5TB98fxqQGx88mZd\">History of Handedness in Video Games</a> by Face Full of&nbsp;Eyes</p>\n\n<p>Equal parts essay and visual compendium, Face Full of Eyes’ video contains a dizzying amount of clips from hundreds of video games, all answering the same seemingly inconsequential question: how do the game’s characters handle guns with their dominant and non-dominant hands? The answer for any particular game isn’t important. The point of the video is instead that no decision is meaningless when creating art. In a created world like a video game, everything is a chance for storytelling— even the choice to depict how a left-handed person might have to reload a right-handed&nbsp;gun.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/i4EFkspO5p4?si=n3C1nziET8ojNYlc\">Four-Byte Burger</a> by&nbsp;Ahoy</p>\n\n<p>The experience of watching Ahoy attempt a perfect replication of a digital illustration from 1985 somehow captures the energy of a 21st-century sculptor attempting to re-carve Michelangelo’s David. While he starts with modern Photoshop tools, the latter half of the video is a deep dive into save file formats and 40-year old display technology; a crucial realisation in the video comes from a monitor’s changing colour tone when turned to portrait orientation. The fact that all this is in service of a delightfully whimsical picture of a burger? Even&nbsp;better.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"genevicius\">Tomas&nbsp;Genevičius</a></h3>\n\n<p>Film critic,<a href=\"http://kritikosatlasas.com/\"> kritikosatlasas.com</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/818633482\">A History of the World According to Getty Images</a> by Richard&nbsp;Misek</p>\n\n<p>This video essay gives additional meaning to the idea that cinema is a warehouse of&nbsp;memory.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/868241324\">The Thinking Machine #73: Revealing Leone</a> by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian&nbsp;Martin</p>\n\n<p>Video essay exploring Sergio Leone’s technique of “revealing”.

I used three parameters in the composition of my list: I had to choose works by different essayists from those for whom I voted in 2022; and my selection could only feature personal favourites in the field of videographic criticism, that is, a specific film, television and screen studies subset of the “video essay”. The videos also needed to be already published and freely available online, which ruled out a lot of great works for which I will undoubtedly be voting next year.

This particular video, published in issue 9(4) of the journal Feminist Media Histories, is extraordinary. As the editor of that journal Jennifer Bean wrote of it in her<a href=\"https://online.ucpress.edu/fmh/article/9/4/1/197466/IntroductionFeeling-Videographic-Criticism\"> marvellous introductory essay</a> for the issue of <span class=\"caps\">FMH</span>, “[Zecchi’s] voice as well as her embodied, emotive presence on the screen are intrinsic features of a project that deploys videographic tools to sustain what she calls a ‘practice-based counterarchive’ capable of reversing the ongoing ‘dispossession’ of women’s contributions to media history.” Terri Francis’s remarkable 2019 video essay<a href=\"https://online.ucpress.edu/fmh/article/9/4/32/197468/Josephine-Baker-Watches-Herself?fbclid=IwAR0_KNgj9SMJYVwd-ueoIdUHS3jJcVcU2MTddRYiRXjrYfEMD7mD6ys0Ohs\"> Joséphine Baker Watches Herself</a> is also published in the issue’s exploration of the potential of videographic criticism for feminist media historiographies, alongside powerful new work by Celia&nbsp;Sainz.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://necsus-ejms.org/with-a-camera-in-hand-i-was-alive/\">With a Camera in Hand, I Was Alive</a> by Katie&nbsp;Bird</p>\n\n<p>Katie Bird’s virtuosic exploration of the affordances of desktop filmmaking to access the sensations of using a physical camera (and its highly original and moving audiovisual maker’s statement) made a magisterial contribution to Kevin B.

The other entries in the dossier were of excellent quality across the board, and I would particularly point to Ritika Kaushik and Brunella Tedesco-Barlocco’s great video essays for the ways in which, like Bird’s, their work points to how screen capture techniques can be harnessed to investigate very important and highly diverse screen studies research&nbsp;questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"hofmann\">Maria&nbsp;Hofmann</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/hofma071\">Film scholar</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user76036242/videos\">video essayist</a>; University of&nbsp;Minnesota</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/838267891\">Kiss me softly | crackly | sharply</a> by Lucy Fife&nbsp;Donaldson</p>\n\n<p>The combination of visuals and sound in this intriguing video forces the viewer into attention, listening and watching carefully while examining one’s own expectations and intimate reactions to individual&nbsp;moments.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zfmedienwissenschaft.de/en/online/videography-blog/nebular-epistemics\">Nebular Epistemics</a> by Alan <span class=\"caps\">O’L</span>eary</p>\n\n<p>Incredibly dense on a theoretical level, performatively innovative, and yet still accessible and hilarious — what an accomplishment to combine these elements into a coherent whole and convincing&nbsp;argument.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tecmerin.uc3m.es/project/being-dolls-or-not-spinning-mothers-and-daughters-in-elena-ferrantes-adaptations/?lang=en\">Being Dolls (or Not): Spinning Mothers and Daughters in Elena Ferrante’s Adaptations</a> by Barbara&nbsp;Zecchi</p>\n\n<p>A dazzling watching experience that masterfully interweaves critical argument with audiovisual spectacle; a prime example of Zecchi’s superior sense of rhythm that permeates all her&nbsp;work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/home-bleak-home-bleak\">Home Is Bleak.

A Live Performance</a> by Alice&nbsp;Lenay</p>\n\n<p>The notion of what videographic criticism can do has been constantly challenged for a few years now.

Attracted by the potential, they began by destroying everything. Then it was time to rebuild. To the weight of the rubble cans was added the weight of their families’ dreams and values. With affection and humour, Sophie deconstructs patriarchy, capitalism and inheritance in an attempt to make room for achievable&nbsp;utopias.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202304474.html\">Marungka Tjalatjunu (Dipped in Black)</a> by Derik Lynch, Matthew&nbsp;Thorne</p>\n\n<p>The film follows Yankunytjatjara man Derik Lynch’s road trip back to Country for spiritual healing, as memories from his childhood return. A journey from the oppression of white city life in Adelaide, back home to his remote Anangu Community (Aputula) to perform on sacred Inma ground. Inma is a traditional form of storytelling using the visual, verbal, and physical. It is how Anangu Tjukurpa (story connected to country / dreaming / myth / lore) have been passed down for over 60,000+ years from generation to&nbsp;generation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://juliaborderie.com/en/aequo/\">Æquo</a> by Eloïse Le Gallo, Julia&nbsp;Borderie</p>\n\n<p>The sound of an alphorn echoes in the mountains while glaciers are dripping. Far away, on an oceanographic boat, researchers probe the invisible seabed. Geological bodies of salt and ice emerge from the digital depths of a software. They melt and disintegrate in the hands of scientists. The filmmakers place encounters at the heart of their approach, anchoring their creative process in a poetic&nbsp;approach.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oyster-films.info/pacific-club\">Pacific Club</a> by Valentin&nbsp;Noujaïm</p>\n\n<p>In 1979, the Pacific Club opened in the basement of La Défense, the business district of Paris. It was the first nightclub for Arabs from the suburbs – a parallel world of dance, sweat, young love, and one-night utopias. Azedine, 17 years old at the time, tells us the forgotten story of this club and of this generation who dreamed of integrating into France but who soon came face to face with racism, the <span class=\"caps\">AIDS</span> epidemic, and heroin. The film gives visibility to the forgotten, the invisible and reflects on the power dynamics and dominance system within French&nbsp;society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.swissfilms.ch/en/movie/Out-of-the-Blue/A1DDED4E78CB4ECF839C9CECF54CA3EB\">Out of the Blue</a> by Morgane&nbsp;Frund</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, an auteur film causes a scandal due to its sex scenes. The filmmaker is 16 and one of the angry viewers. Ten years later, she is ready to settle the score with this film in the form of a video essay. Her film visits ways to tame the ‘male gaze’ and understand her position in a still man-made/thought&nbsp;world.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/us/films/tierra-de-leche\">Tierra de leche</a> by Milton Guillen and Fiona Guy&nbsp;Hall</p>\n\n<p>On New England dairy farms, daily life orbits around the milking parlour. Here, machinery and cows come together as an exploitation mechanism of migrant workers from Central America, consuming their every waking hour and even infiltrating their dreams. The film denounces a terrible reality told in the most poetic and respectful&nbsp;way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"jude\">Radu&nbsp;Jude</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/cast/radu-jude\">Filmmaker</a></p>\n\n<p>Not sure what a video essay is, so my choices might be slightly&nbsp;off-topic.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/aigeneratednonsense/videos/250567407727565/\">Mickey Takes Acid</a> by <span class=\"caps\">AI</span> Generated&nbsp;Nonsense</p>\n\n<p>It is great, very funny, and not sure a human could find all those weird&nbsp;connections.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0d3hwl1/russia-19851999-traumazone\">TraumaZone</a> by Adam&nbsp;Curtis</p>\n\n<p>I heard many people complaining that Adam Curtis’s essay is simplistic, you cannot express the collapse of the <span class=\"caps\">USSR</span> in such a short time etc. Maybe it is so, but it is exactly because of this method that he achieves a kind of poetic truth, if I may say&nbsp;so.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFIRPG0x6xg&amp;t=568s\">Der Elvis</a> by Joe&nbsp;Moritsugu</p>\n\n<p>It is older, but since I never have heard of it, I consider it new.

Maza is an online video veteran, previously creating for Vox. His independent work allows him to flex his style: a blend of professionalism that says “this is worth taking seriously and I’ve put in the work” and casualness that says “we’re still going to make a tough topic go down easy.” He tackles some of the most contentious topics affecting our political landscape – this video covers the manufacturing of the “debt crisis” in the minds of the American public. The heart of each video lies in the wrap-up: Carlos has a knack for leaving viewers off with a perfect mix of “this sucks,” and “but I believe in us” and finally, “fuck&nbsp;yeah.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV8BnxuPF2Y&amp;ab_channel=JamesDeLisio\">Cinema in Pain: Decoding “Mad God”</a> by James&nbsp;DeLisio</p>\n\n<p>“Physical pain does not simply resist language but actively destroys&nbsp;it.”</p>\n\n<p>This thought-provoking video is an approachable look at a notoriously repulsive film (which I do not say lightly, as a squeamish viewer myself!). It proposes one lens of interpretation: what if a film like Mad God is our best chance as an audience to experience an articulation of pain through art? If pain is incommunicable through words, what sights and sounds, what deviations from expectation, can bring us into that headspace? This examination of the non-straightforward means through which cinema may operate has bent my brain, and I must recommend that you experience it for&nbsp;yourself.</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"slice_articles\" data-paragraph-id=\"0a2604fa-8c6d-484b-b076-7998b58c84f0\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"719448\" data-paragraph-type=\"video_embed\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlu-Ffdxocc&amp;ab_channel=maxteeth\">The Man/Car Gender Binary in John Carpenter’s Christine</a> by max&nbsp;teeth</p>\n\n<p>“Men are of course men and cars are cars but women are also&nbsp;cars.”</p>\n\n<p>In the vein of Women Are Not Objects, but Objects Are Still Women, Max takes us through the special cinematic relationships between a man and his car, a man and his car who is also a woman, and a man and another man and a car which is somewhere nearby. The point: how have we learned to signify masculinity on screen? And how does John Carpenter’s Christine induce horror by perverting those signifiers? A cherry on top: this video is&nbsp;hilarious.</p>\n\n<p>As a bonus, I’ll also recommend <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_jScGztAlus?si=BJ-XXSCN_13khU7Y\">their video on Hereditary</a> for its crisp, creative, and playful visual&nbsp;style.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2N_SGny_-0&amp;list=LL&amp;index=82&amp;ab_channel=TheNukes\">The Essential Whiteness of One-Hit Wonders</a> by The&nbsp;Nukes</p>\n\n<p>“Hey Josh, you’re white. Who sang Tainted Love? I answered easily and without thought: ‘Soft Cell.’ But a few have offered me a truth that I, in my whiteness, did not know then, but do know now. Soft Cell’s Tainted Love is a&nbsp;cover.”</p>\n\n<p>This is a tale as old as time, and yet even if you think you know this story, this video is a journey worth taking. Josh from The Nukes takes us on a personal musical tour through the many, many hidden (and not so hidden) ways that the music industry has historically catered to white sensibilities. Interesting, frustrating, and relentlessly funny – make sure to read the chapter markers for an extra dose of “this creator is having way too much&nbsp;fun.”</p>\n\n<p>(Another bonus recommendation: Josh’s “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hoVIjjD3Os4?si=EaWiOGjneMhYkDBY\">Is it Impossible to Dad</a>” is a heartfelt, prescient examination of the gap we attempt to bridge in parenthood – and in all relationships, really.

Well, in that vein, Kendra’s channel has been a fantastic discovery for me this year. Kendra talks about architecture the way I talk about That One Funny Thing My Friend Did That One Time. Her style feels comfy and inclusionary, like you’re both laughing&nbsp;together.</p>\n\n<p>It’s always fun letting someone take you on a journey through their random obsession, and watching all 151 Architectural Digest home tours probably enters “obsession” territory (and yet, one gets the sense that if not for the video, Kendra still would’ve done this anyway). The impression is less “I self-flagellate for content,” and more “let me give you my best takeaways from a task that you will likely never do yourself.” The difference between the two, I realised, is surprisingly important to&nbsp;me!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrT1aLP1xaU&amp;list=LL&amp;index=44&amp;ab_channel=KaiAfterKai\">The Importance of Spaces in The Last Black Man in San Francisco</a> by&nbsp;KaiAfterKai</p>\n\n<p>This video is a lovely exploration of the importance of personal connection to space, the ability to self-actualise through space, and connection to history through space, which all feel especially prescient to a generation of young adults who have been gatekept from home&nbsp;ownership.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like listening to a guided meditation tape; Kai is, as always, soothing in their delivery, punctuated by perfect music choices and encapsulated within a flawless structure. This is the essay equivalent of sitting back in a field, relaxing, letting ideas wash over&nbsp;you.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIcnCaVsYFI\">Is the “Off-Grid” Lifestyle a Lie??</a> by Maggie Mae&nbsp;Fish</p>\n\n<p>Also on the topic of spaces, Maggie explores a trend that may seem like a dream to young people growing increasingly unsure that they will ever be able to afford typical homeownership: off-gridding. Specifically, she calls attention to the way that people discover new lifestyles through the Internet, and whether the people selling that lifestyle are leaving out important details (and why they may be incentivised to do&nbsp;so!).</p>\n\n<p>Following up on her 2022 video on the Netflix show Motel Makeover, this video continues Maggie’s deep dives into the ways in which the lens of “content” turns building and designing spaces into a sales pitch, while unearthing the hidden costs that these shows are not incentivised to&nbsp;reveal.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"kiss\">Miklós&nbsp;Kiss</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://research.rug.nl/en/persons/mikl%C3%B3s-kiss\">Associate professor in audiovisual arts and cognition</a> at University of Groningen, <span class=\"caps\">NL</span> / co-author of <a href=\"https://scalar.usc.edu/works/film-studies-in-motion/index\">Film Studies in Motion: From Audiovisual Essay to Academic Research&nbsp;Video</a></p>\n\n<p>Trying to have a full grasp on a year’s videographic output is increasingly becoming an impossible effort.

A 27-minute contemplatively thorough dissection of Joris Ivens’ 12-minute short film Regen [Rain] – that creates an ‘archetypal rainstorm’ out of an 8-month sampling of rainy images – is exactly such a videographic&nbsp;work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/809458111\">Some Thoughts Occasioned by Four Desktops</a> by Ariel&nbsp;Avissar</p>\n\n<p>An attentive response, in desktop video form, to the four desktop videos (by Johannes Binotto, Katie Bird, Brunella Tedesco-Barlocco, and Ritika Kaushik – wish I could include all these videos in this best-of selection) that were part of the audiovisual section of the Spring edition of the Necsus journal.

The essay breaks with the <span class=\"caps\">US</span>-dominance in the study of (global) stardom by focusing on a Latin American star who becomes famous in Russia, Israel, and Central-European countries, thereby calling attention to a transnational movement that is not often addressed in star studies.

By connecting archival footage of early stage performances by Joséphine Baker to televised interviews with the iconic star in which she looks back and comments on her own star image, provides space for the Baker’s agency and voice within the narrative of her stardom in a way that could not be done so effectively (and affectively) in a written&nbsp;essay.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste\">chaste/unchaste</a> by Maryam Tafakory Published in [in]Transition, “chaste/unchaste” by Maryam Tafakory effectively challenges the binary that is spelled out in the title. Starting with a four-way split screen and a graphic that looks like a target finder from a rifle (or like a measuring rod), the audiovisual essay presents images of women from Iranian cinema, thereby highlighting how they are continuously scrutinised and policed, yet also how they challenge the omnipresent gaze. Using mirroring and repetition, combined by an uncanny soundtrack, the essay forces viewers (at least me) to question their preconceived notions and binary thinking. And what a surprise when the credits reveal that the footage comes from 32 films! As Maria Walsh concludes in her peer-review of the essay: “This is brave&nbsp;work.”</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"kreutzer\">Evelyn&nbsp;Kreutzer</a></h3>\n\n<p>Postdoctoral researcher and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/evelynkreutzer\">video essayist</a>, <a href=\"https://www.filmuniversitaet.de/en/portrait/person/evelyn-kreutzer\">Film University Babelsberg Konrad&nbsp;Wolf</a></p>\n\n<p>Just like in past years, I want to emphasise that I do not consider this a or my “best of” list but rather a list of video essays from different sub-genres and platforms that I found particularly interesting this year and with which I aim to hint at the breadth of video essay&nbsp;production.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KauemIMxFo\">moving poems: a raisin in the sun (1961)</a> by Desirée de&nbsp;Jesús</p>\n\n<p>An evocative and very layered meditation on poetry, drama, film and their (cross-)adaptations.

The video also includes one of the best “plot twists” I’ve seen in video essay work so&nbsp;far!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhZxoKNopJQ\">Why Do We Make Comedies about Existential Dread?</a> by&nbsp;Afterthoughts</p>\n\n<p>A highly entertaining and evocative video on contemporary absurdist, dark, “meme-y” comedy that asks questions like “Why are we so weird and sad right now?” and ponders on realisations like “When I’m alone with my thoughts, I’m alone with y’all’s&nbsp;thoughts.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/833149389\">Practices of Viewing: Description</a> by Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</p>\n\n<p>Another great piece from Binotto’s Practices of Viewing series – one that I referred to as an “anti video essay” when I first saw&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202304676.html\">Hello Dankness</a> by Soda&nbsp;Jerk</p>\n\n<p>An impressive assemblage of excerpts from all kinds of Hollywood films from the past ca. 40 years, sampled into a dark comedic take on the 2016 <span class=\"caps\">US</span> elections and the Trump&nbsp;presidency.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhATFOBu9l8\">How to Make Money from Video Essays: A Guide to Pitching</a> by Will&nbsp;Webb</p>\n\n<p>An unconventional pick since it’s not a video essay itself but a video about how to make (specifically pitch) video essays but one that I find useful to include here (perhaps as a bonus pick) because it provides insights into the ways in which video essayists produce and monetise their work outside the direct infrastructures of academic&nbsp;institutions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"lacurie\">Occitane&nbsp;Lacurie</a></h3>\n\n<p>Video essayist, critique and researcher in visual&nbsp;culture</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/872459036\">Cycles of Labor: In the Metaverse, We Will Be Housewives</a> by Veronika Hanáková, Martin Tremčinský, Jiří&nbsp;Anger</p>\n\n<p>Using interfaces familiar to anyone who grew up in the 2000s and 2010s, the authors reedit a film that recently won the votes of the Sight and Sound Greatest Films of all Times poll: Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman. I really loved how they manage to produce a feminist and environmental analysis of the film using these layouts, subverting our video-essayistic habits (using cinema as a hermeneutic tool) by calling on videogame grammar to study&nbsp;film.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ommX0US1llM\">O fumo do fogo (Smoke of the Fire)</a> by Daryna&nbsp;Mamaisur</p>\n\n<p>Daryna Mamaisur is a Ukrainian artist and a refugee in Portugal. In her essay, she films closeups of her Portuguese handbooks, finding echoes of dispatches her friend sends her from their country – the dots and shapes of the three-colour printing of the old-fashioned books resemble the low-quality videos. I was fascinated by the way Mamaisur films her hands hovering over her desktop covered by childlike images, and how as soon as the editing flips them, the war and its trauma&nbsp;appears.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/819559793\">البحث عن السوري الإرهابي In Search of the Syrian Fanatic </a> by Abou&nbsp;Naddara</p>\n\n<p>The Syrian filmmaker collective Abou Naddara conducted this year a multimedia investigation about an image and a corpse, both hidden underneath layers of French colonial propaganda. The images come from one of the first silent fiction films, The Assassination of General Kléber (Georges Hatot, 1897), depicting the murder of the Napoleonic officer in 1800 by a Syrian student in Egypt. Abou Naddara discovered the remains of the presumed perpetrator, Soleyman El-Halebi, are kept by a French Museum, in its colonial collection and decided to take action: he wrote both a written and a videographic letter to French authorities, asking them to return the body as well as renounce the racist cliché, first printed in visual culture by the 1897 film, of the fanatic&nbsp;Syrian.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zent93oWko\">Alain Krivine, le trotskisme permanent (Alain Krivine, the Permanent Trotskism)</a> by Usul and&nbsp;Ostpolitik</p>\n\n<p>This video is part of a series created by the French videaste Usul and Ostpolitik, the “Portraits” telling the stories of central figures of French political history in a critical perspective (the series is published for the online channel Blast, continued by Ostpolitik and another youtuber, Modiie; meanwhile, Usul started another series, “Rhinoceros” about the rightisation of media). Together, they also produced “Ouvrez les guillemets” (“Open the Quotes”) (for the online journal Mediapart) about political news. I wanted to cite one of their works for several reasons. One of them is that I find it very interesting how a video essay can engage with social and political criticism through mediatic images – the way Serge Daney, for instance, used to do it in a textual way in Libération. I also wanted to pay a specific homage to Usul, who for the last ten years, is, in my opinion, the most stimulating political video essayist of the French YouTube landscape and draws me to the art of montage and media criticism with his latest series “Mes chers contemporains” (“Dear&nbsp;Contemporaries”).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chloegalibertlaine.com/i-would-like-to-rage\">I Would Like to Rage</a> by Chloé&nbsp;Galibert-Laîné</p>\n\n<p>Finally and above all, I wanted to mention a piece by Chloé Galibert-Laîné, whose work in general is of crucial importance to me, and whose I Would Like to Rage, in particular, touched me enormously. As I had the chance to tell them, their work navigates brilliantly the tricky art of self-memeification to address gendered and intimate political issues, escaping every trap set by the internalised (patriarchal) injunctions of concealing the “I” and its&nbsp;revolts.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"laird\">Colleen&nbsp;Laird</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.ubc.ca/profile/colleen-laird/\">Assistant professor</a> of Japanese cinema, The University of British&nbsp;Columbia</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/841304471\">Thelma <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Louise: Rape Culture, Mudflaps, <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Vaginal Horizons </a>by Dayna&nbsp;McLeod</p>\n\n<p>With this righteous and riotous very close look at Ridley Scott’s Thelma <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Louise (1991), Dayna McLeod continues to be one of the boldest and bravest new practitioners of the video essay. Constructed in three acts, the piece highlights the interplay between actions and reactions, both in the film and beyond to the discourse surrounding it. The end result, and in particular the resulting ending, is a thought-provoking dive into videographic criticism and film&nbsp;scholarship.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste\">chaste/unchaste</a> by Maryam&nbsp;Tafakory</p>\n\n<p>Every time I watch a piece by Maryam Tafakory, I am overwhelmed by contradictory emotions. “chaste/unchaste,” Tafakory’s contribution to the ‘Feminist Videographic Diptych’ special issue of [in]Transition, is no exception. The use of uncanny repetition and graphic matches is both mesmerising and agitating, familiarising and defamiliarising, grounding and destabilising. And as always, I’m stunned by the quantity of films Tafakory uses to create the illusion of effortless coherent&nbsp;cohesion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://deformativesoundlab.co.uk/2023/09/27/super-volume-a-tactile-art/\">A Tactile Art</a> by Cormac&nbsp;Donnelly</p>\n\n<p>It’s worthwhile to access Cormac Donnelly’s “second iteration of the Super Volume project” on his Deformative Sound Lab website to read about the process of making a video that is very much about process and processing. While Donnelly considers the piece a representation of a tactile art, what haunts me about the video is the juxtaposition of the ephemerality in the piece—both of the transparent layering of the participants’ hands as well as the audio track itself—with the technology at the intersection of the two: the artefact of interaction. I find this work unsettling in the very best of&nbsp;ways.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/872459036\">Cycles of Labour: In the Metaverse, We Will Be Housewives</a> by Veronika Hanáková, Martin Tremčinský, and Jiří&nbsp;Anger</p>\n\n<p>With each collaborative work, I find the dynamic duo of Veronica Hanáková and Jiří Anger increasingly enchanting. I can’t help it; I like their style. I was torn between this video and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/groups/audiovisualcy/videos/828945268\">their entry</a> in Ariel Avissar’s new Screen Stars Dictionary project which has some similar formal conceits, but the tongue-in-cheek nature of reframing Jeanne Dielmann’s daily routine as a “The Sim’s”-esque video game was the deciding factor. All too often, scholarly videographic criticism can feel heavy and bleak, particularly with trends in exploring thematised trauma. Here, along with Martin Tremčinský, Hanáková and Anger make a case for serious&nbsp;fun.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alisonpeirse.com/crochet-is-sick\">Crochet Is Sick</a> by Alison&nbsp;Peirse</p>\n\n<p>A companion piece to last year’s award-winning and frequent festival feature “Knit One, Stab Two,” here Alison Peirse shifts a feminist lens from the needle to the hook, and from the voice-over to the visualised voice, in this work on the role of crochet in horror. Peirse is developing a distinct videographic style and “Crochet” is a prime example of this aesthetic that takes the video essay (and what we think we know about horror) delightfully and impishly up a notch (or three). Note the original soundtrack created especially for the&nbsp;work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chloegalibertlaine.com/i-would-like-to-rage\">I Would Like to Rage</a> by Chloé&nbsp;Galibert-Laîné</p>\n\n<p>Currently only available on the festival circuit, Chloé Galibert-Laîné’s most recent work is a deeply personal performance of catharsis years in the making. It is also, thankfully, very funny. The video is an inspiring whirlwind through multiple media objects and platforms, a flurry of failed and forced expressions of rage, that sticks its landing and compels us, once again, to rethink what we know about the potentials of the video essay. Details about forthcoming availability are likely to be found on their website in the&nbsp;future.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/lacurieo\">Xena’s Body: A Menstrual Auto-Investigation Using an iPhone</a> by Occitane&nbsp;Lacurie</p>\n\n<p>I had the pleasure of seeing this video as a work in progress piece at the ‘In the Works: Makings and Unmakings of the Video Essay’ conference held at the Lucerne School of Art and Design at the beginning of November of this year. Even in an unfinished form, it was still one of my favourite videos I encountered this year, as well as one of the most timely. A desktop video in cell phone portrait mode, and perhaps even edited on one, Lacurie’s remarkable production brings together the personal and the political through the act of “doom scrolling” that involves, among other things, an episode of “Xena: Warrior Princess,” the iPhone menstruation application, text messages, online message boards, demonic imaginations of cell phone home screens, website searches, and an online tarot reading.

Seeing it again this year at the Hamburger Bahnhof, I could appreciate how much care it takes in reconstructing sites of Algerian cinema: not only sets from films set in Algeria, but also spaces where Algerian cinema is screened, preserved and contemplated. The video essay as artistic theme park, in the best sense possible, film history playfully resurrected.

Even while keeping within the format of a feature film, it is as expansive as Sedira’s installation, bravely projecting itself into a post-cinematic, post-human finale.

This enthralling and meticulously edited piece uses a binary of chaste vs. unchaste to collapse in on itself as a gendered structure of representation in Iranian cinema. Tafakory uses repetition and juxtaposition to emphasise this undoing and mirrors clips of women in grids of four where they are (now) engaged with each other onscreen. She overlays certain clips, which seep into and onto each other as a form of touching, as if to queer the materiality of these clips as well as the newly formed relationships she has created through her&nbsp;editing.</p>\n\n<p>Xena’s Body: A Menstrual Auto-Investigation Using an iPhone by Occitane&nbsp;Lacurie</p>\n\n<p>A masterful and hypnotic piece that is seemingly edited on a smartphone that simultaneously demonstrates the source materials and inspiration for the work, while showing the methods and thinking of its construction. Lacurie takes us on an expansive menstruation journey that is personal and political—navigating apps, memes, video clips, and a tarot card reading through the analysis of a fatal penetrative wound on Xena Warrior Princess’s body. A mesmerising video essay from, In the Works: Makings and Unmakings of the Video Essay, Lucerne School of Art and Design, Switzerland.

Galibert-Laîné’s thorough and thoughtful practice is fully on display as they take us through various machinations of online and mediatised rage, its performativity, expression, and ownership, and how they experience or rather, attempt to experience rage authentically. A triumph of intelligent vulnerability expressed through an assemblage of self-reflection, video clips, memes, gifs, and Leslie Knope homages, this endearing delight of a video essay is surely coming to a film festival near&nbsp;you.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/838267891\">Kiss me softly | crackly | sharply</a> by Lucy Fife&nbsp;Donaldson</p>\n\n<p>An impeccable experimental video essay that exaggerates and emphasises the uncanny through foley and feminist intervention. Fife Donaldson aptly mixes and amplifies the sharp edges of <span class=\"caps\">ASMR</span> sound artist Julie Rose Bower’s work by replacing the soundtrack for the knife scene in Kiss Me Deadly. Switchblades pop and fist punches snap and crack onscreen through Fife Donaldson’s use of this unique collection of sound, and her use of visual repetition and slow motion. I am particularly drawn to how she lingers on sound during a slow motion shot of the would-be attacker’s descent to the ground as he slides down a wall after the attempted knife&nbsp;fight.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/786280371\">Practices of Viewing: Ending </a>by Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</p>\n\n<p>A gong repeatedly sounds as ‘The End’ title text from a variety of films are shown onscreen in several languages. We hear a tapping—a soft clicking that is perhaps his keyboard, our viewership guided by his hand. The way that Binotto has arranged these endings and silenced their corresponding soundtracks are filled with loss as they each mark an ending to a specific film as well as the end of his incredible <a href=\"https://transferences.org/videoessays/practices-of-viewing/\">Practices of Viewing series</a>. Binotto cites Roland Barthes while seemingly articulating his own work ethic: “writing as absolute brings with it a particular existential movement: the drive to finish the work in order to start again”. I can’t wait to see what comes&nbsp;next.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/847046095\">moving poems: a raisin in the sun (1961)</a> by Desirée de&nbsp;Jesús</p>\n\n<p>Using Evelyn Kreutzer’s Moving Poems prompt that asks makers to pair a poem with a media object, moving poems: a raisin in the sun (1961) is a poignant and poetic work that capitalises on affecting performances from the 1961 film adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun. De Jesús engages Langston Hughes’s short poem Harlem in onscreen text while expertly and artfully using opacity, repetition, movement, dialogue, and match cuts to sound in this stunning and layered poetic video&nbsp;essay.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/854913117\">Jeanne Dielman: On / Off</a> by Dan&nbsp;Noall</p>\n\n<p>A sublime supercut of every time the title character of Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles turns on and off the lights. Noall jumpcuts us through each of the rooms of this film and the quiet bland domesticity of house and sex work with this simple task. Only fans of this iconic film will recognise the importance of Noall’s final shot where Jeanne turns off the light of the kitchen while firmly grasping her silver scissors and shutting the door behind her with a&nbsp;thud.</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"slice_articles\" data-paragraph-id=\"9f5a5914-d47c-40e3-a20b-0baecdd52035\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"719465\" data-paragraph-type=\"video_embed\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"meadows\">Queline&nbsp;Meadows</a></h3>\n\n<p>Video essayist (as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC823RgYGE4ASwksrIvIySAQ\">kikikrazed</a>) and community manager for <a href=\"https://theessaylibrary.com/\">The Essay&nbsp;Library</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/X9RYuvPCQUA\">Everything is a Remix (Complete Updated 2023 Edition)</a> by Kirby&nbsp;Ferguson</p>\n\n<p>Kirby Ferguson has revisited this project multiple times since it debuted in 2010, remixing his own work to create new iterations.

In my own video essay work, Be Kind Rewind is one of my biggest inspirations. Every video amazes me with the sheer knowledge and passion for film on display. This essay is no different as it juggles the interconnected careers of actors, producers, and directors within the studio system at the&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/wV8BnxuPF2Y\">Cinema in Pain: Decoding “Mad God”</a> by James&nbsp;DeLisio</p>\n\n<p>Some video essays that rely on literature to examine a film can become too text-heavy, but this essay never feels like that. DeLisio’s careful narration and textured sound design allows him to speak with the film instead of over it. This intelligent, well-edited video cements James DeLisio’s status as one of the most exciting emerging video&nbsp;essayists.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"natalio\">Carlos&nbsp;Natálio</a></h3>\n\n<p>Film teacher and researcher at Escola das Artes in Católica University (O Porto); film programmer at IndieLisboa Film Festival; film critic at <a href=\"https://apaladewalsh.com/\">À pala de Walsh</a> website.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agencia.curtas.pt/filmes/show/570\">Exotic Words Drifted</a> by Sandro&nbsp;Aguilar</p>\n\n<p>At the edge of the word lies silence, hesitation. On the other side of colour, there are bright colours, gray, black and white. This is a film that sits on the other side of the mirror and takes us through the tense and enigmatic reverse side of classic cinema. In Aguilar’s audiovisual essay, everything floats, expectantly, waiting to happen, inaugurating a new order, like a tense relationship between day and night, between the negative and the positive of a film&nbsp;stock.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/history-world-according-getty-images\">A History of the World According to Getty Images </a>by Richard&nbsp;Misek</p>\n\n<p>Audiovisual essays are tools to unlock the imaginary and highlight possible paths and barriers.

Mirjam Leutwiler’s short audiovisual essay is not only interpreting Michel Serre’s text “The Five Senses. A Philosophy of Mingled Bodies”, but also telling us how that network about touching and feeling is underway in the cinematic&nbsp;phenomenology.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/877135063\">Kinoapparatum Remade. A Videographic Montage Experiment.</a> by Johannes Binotto, Maurice Dietziker, Linus Bolliger, Arseni Gavrilov, Kilian Frei, Andrina Moos, Cécile Brossard, Sven Friedli, Mirjam Leutwiler, Jana Schlegel, Melina Hofer, Anja Hubmann, Fynn Groeber, Nora&nbsp;Gruetter.</p>\n\n<p>Kinoapparatum Remade is not only an homage to Vertov, Kaufman and Svilova’s seminal film Man with a Movie Camera. And also not only a reflection on Manovich’s ideas on the film regarding new media. It is all of this but it is also a collective collaborative effort in which we can see that recreation it also followed by actualisation, complementation and creative choices based on movement and form. And these particular choices of the “collective with the moving images” tells us that it is not only a question of past versus incoming future when we look at 1929’s&nbsp;masterpiece.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/841294355\">Against Polish or, Notes on Videographic Labor or, You Could Remix Blazing Saddles Today </a>Will&nbsp;Digravio</p>\n\n<p>Digravio’s original audiovisual essay may work against the idea of perfection and neatness as a possible disguised style. But it is also an exposition of the work involved in the audiovisual essay. In this sense, it enters a loop, a mise-en-abîme where a “meta worker” develops a similar “meta mirror” to better highlight the nature of what is involved when reworking the images and sounds of a&nbsp;film.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"ogara\">Clare <span class=\"caps\">O’G</span>ara</a></h3>\n\n<p>Media and cultural studies graduate student at the University of&nbsp;Wisconsin–Madison</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/EiZhdpLXZ8Q?si=q5MZJQG94Z4013uS\">The Future Is a Dead Mall — Decentraland and the Metaverse</a> by Dan Olson (Folding&nbsp;Ideas)</p>\n\n<p>Another long-form triumph from the creator of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YQ_xWvX1n9g?si=SE_fcCi_C4FmDO13\">Line Goes Up – The Problem with <span class=\"caps\">NTF</span>s</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JTfhYyTuT44?si=eOm3t0z8Ox-Dg8P5\">In Search of a Flat Earth</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/SArtgoMMDNg?si=PGXEZSdA7rZaGUH0\">Searching for Humanity in Fortnite’s Battle Royale</a> by Jonathan McIntosh (Pop Culture&nbsp;Detective)</p>\n\n<p>A fusion between a “Let’s Play” and a conventional YouTube video essay, this moving autoethnography finds optimism and community in one of the most unlikely online gaming&nbsp;spaces.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OuaDbu_VBLY?si=-pCjdg9zMYL9ILJV\">Everything Is Sludge: Art in the Post-Human Era</a> by Lily&nbsp;Alexandre</p>\n\n<p>Alexandre’s cleverly profound work on gender, sexuality, art, and digital culture never disappoints.

Let me name some makers in addition to the many mentioned below that have impacted my understanding of the practice this year: Ariane Hudelet, Cormac Donnelly, Dayna McLeod, Irina Trocan, Jemma Saunders, John Gibbs, Kevin Ferguson, Liz Greene, Maria Hofmann, Maud Ceuterick, Oswald Iten, Richard Misek, Susan Harewood… My point with this list, which could have been indefinitely extended, is that investigating the possibilities of the video essay is a collective endeavour. Brian Eno has a notion of collective ‘scenius’ (as opposed to individual ‘genius’) which refers to “the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene”: it’s this boisterous collective intelligence that I think we’re witnessing with the explosion of the video essay. Can it last? I do worry that the period of expansion, exploration and experimentation will exhaust itself, and that a single preferred mode of audiovisual rhetoric will be asserted or be insisted upon by the journals. I’m relieved this hasn’t happened yet, not in 2023 at any rate. And so my selection (which could easily have been several further sets of seven videos) is intended to indicate some of the striking variety, as well as the quality, of the work being done.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/827670996\">Memories of It</a> by Kathleen Loock<br>\n<br>\n‘Memories of It’ mixes film, trailer and documentary footage with personal reflection and interview in order to tease out Kathleen Loock’s traumatic memory of watching (and fast-forwarding) the 1990 adaptation of It on <span class=\"caps\">VHS</span> as a child. She links this memory with the condition of the Wendekinder, children like her of the former <span class=\"caps\">GDR</span> forced to cope with a new world after German reunification. Does Kathleen over-sociologise her act of retrospectatorship by invoking shared generational experience? Is the video an attempt to contain as well as explain the threat of traumatic eruption? I’ll just have to watch ‘it’ again…<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/everybody%E2%80%99s-gotta-learn-sometime\">Everybody’s Gotta Learn Sometime</a> by Drew&nbsp;Morton</p>\n\n<p>Thomas Pynchon’s Vineland is my favourite novel and one joy of my 2023 was encountering Peter Coviello’s Vineland Reread, a book that mixes literary criticism, cultural theory and autobiography to evoke the presence of Vineland in Coviello’s life and teaching. Drew Morton’s account of re-viewing and teaching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind at intervals since that film’s release is a similarly rich and joyful intellectual experience – Drew even shares some hard-earned lessons in love. (I recommend comparing the earlier version of the video linked in the creator statement, to see how an adept maker engages with challenging peer&nbsp;review.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/723431318\">Desktop Documentary</a> by Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</p>\n\n<p>Johannes Binotto’s literally/ironically titled ‘Desktop Documentary’ is expressly a “call to clutter”. As such, it makes me terribly anxious. But this is a brilliantly conceived and engagingly performed piece of explicatory and programmatic rhetoric that draws on YouTube how-to videos even as it nods to the opening of Cléo de 5 à 7. I am happy to grant Binotto’s fiction that his desk has not been curated because I am persuaded by his account of the desktop as recalcitrant technology. And I am especially seduced by his call for productive accident and a-rational research methods that look back to&nbsp;surrealism.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/true-enough\">True Enough</a> by Chloé&nbsp;Galibert-Laîné</p>\n\n<p>True Enough might seem a jeu d’esprit compared to Chloé Galibert-Laîné’s longer video essays. But even as it draws on the functional aesthetic of the karaoke video, this adaptation of a text by Will Webb, made for Ariel Avissar and Evelyn Kreutzer’s Once upon A Screen project, is a work of great refinement. Galibert-Laîné creates a “fictional offscreen space” with beautifully composed filmed footage enlivened by dancing light from an unseen television. The cheerful font and sung accompaniment extend the possibilities of onscreen text and voiceover. As an added bonus (or intrinsic moment), it contains the best Simpsons allusion&nbsp;ever.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/chasteunchaste\">chaste/unchaste</a> by Maryam&nbsp;Tafakory</p>\n\n<p>This has been a vintage year for multiscreen. Like the videos by Mittell and Arlander discussed below, Colleen Laird’s Eye-Camera-Ninagawa and Adam Cook’s A Cinema of Bodily Sense deploy multiscreen in powerful but contrasting ways. Maryam Tafakory uses it differently again in ‘chaste/unchaste’. The video is a supercut of female faces (plus one big cat and a gas hob) made from thirty-two Iranian films. It stages its imagining of queer desire as a progression from multiscreen to single screen to superimposition. ‘chaste/unchaste’ is a condensed masterclass in how argument can be made in formal terms without the aid of&nbsp;voiceover.</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"slice_articles\" data-paragraph-id=\"167854aa-b1ce-44f5-a155-08b62f004688\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"719550\" data-paragraph-type=\"video_embed\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.16-9.dk/2023/02/169-seconds-breaking-bad/\">169 Seconds: Trimming Time in Breaking Bad</a> by Jason&nbsp;Mittell</p>\n\n<p>To celebrate its twentieth anniversary, the Danish film journal 16:9 has been publishing 169-second video essays in a series that features makers like Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin, Jaap Kooijman, Catherine Grant, and Barbara Zecchi, with two impressive videos by my Aarhus colleague Mathias Bonde Korsgaard. My favourite is Jason Mittell’s cheeky afterthought to his videographic project on Breaking Bad (it traces Walter White’s story arc through his hairstyles). I like how the application of strict but ludic formal parameters, which Mittell derives from the journal name and video duration, generate a cryptic visual tapestry of the entire&nbsp;series.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://screenworks.org.uk/archive/volume-13-1/revisiting-the-aspen-tree\">Revisiting the Aspen Tree</a> by Annette&nbsp;Arlander</p>\n\n<p>Between 2002 and 2014, artist Annette Arlander recorded weekly visits to locations on Harakka Island near Helsinki in a series of videos. In Revisiting the Aspen Tree, she returns to one such site and embeds those videos in the video document of the more recent visit. Differently from Mittell’s Trimming Time, Arlander uses parameters to dictate a practice that is physical, repetitive and durational. But it reminds me of Will DiGravio’s Rio Bravo project, and like DiGravio’s four-hour Against Polish, it suggests the value of an ‘ambient’ scholarship, in which iterative academic labour is presented in something like real&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"burns\">Michael <span class=\"caps\">O’N</span>eill&nbsp;Burns</a></h3>\n\n<p>Host and producer at&nbsp;Wisecrack</p>\n\n<p>My selections focus on creators who are pushing the critical boundaries of the video essay format. In particular, these are creators who both utilise critical theory, social theory, and philosophy while also producing videos that are entertaining and accessible. They also make the types of videos that leave you feeling like more questions have been opened than answered. Which, especially on YouTube, is an increasingly rare&nbsp;thing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bq3SdfzcA4\">Griftonomics: Why Scams Are Everywhere Now</a> by Tom&nbsp;Nicholas</p>\n\n<p>This video might be Nicholas’s magnum opus, and it feels more like a digital documentary than it does a traditional video essay with a runtime of almost two hours. But he earns every minute of the video by not only exploring the growing phenomenon of digital grifters, but by showing how the logic of grifters exists in an ongoing dialectical relationship with the larger economic structures in our world. In this way he arrives at the logical core of the modern digital grifter, and shows how this same logic is at the heart of much of modern culture. He balances this out by also exploring the psychological factors that have made grifter scams and content so popular. Nicholas also deserves credit for working a level of theatricality into this video (and all of his videos) that’s visually engaging without being distracting. In a world of sad ex-grad students making videos about capitalism ruining our world, Nicholas is the relatable and entertaining lad that takes you just as deep without any performative&nbsp;nihilism.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-hOpY-bFY\">What Red Pill Philosophy Gets Wrong</a> by Then <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Now</p>\n\n<p>2023 was a banner year for content made by reactionary young men utilising various philosophical and political ideas to justify a sense of growing alienation. While it’s easy to dismiss this contingent of creators completely, the harder task is to engage with these trends, openly interrogating their ideological core. And this video does an exemplary job at this task, taking red pill philosophy to task, and in the process, exposing how it offers a shallow simulacrum of actual philosophical responses to complex social problems. The video acknowledges the alienating cultural conditions that produce the “manosphere” while exposing the illogical core at the heart of these ideas. In doing so, Then <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Now has created a video that pushes the viewer to not simply dismiss the modern reactionary, but to understand the logic of this movement, and see how this manner of thinking is more common than we might realise. Ultimately, it’s a video that skillfully uses seemingly esoteric and academic ideas to re-frame the contemporary crisis of masculinity while showing us all why we should&nbsp;care.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhlSgE1dkDc\">the parasite class is killing us.</a> by Alice Capelle<br>\n<br>\nIn this video, Alice Capelle uses the logic of vampire capitalism to show how the modern digital economy increasingly depends on acts of parasitism. She shows how the type of parasitic class relationships exemplified in Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite is replicated in digital spaces, and in particular, among self-styled business gurus using YouTube videos as a way to repeat the logic of class exploitation in the guise of self-help and business advice. Like most of Capelle’s work, this video utilises her ability to synthesise a French brand of critical social theory with an English-language based digital cultural space. This video feels like a sort of ethnography of the contemporary digital parasite, one that both exposes the exploitative core of their content, while hopefully encouraging us to undermine this logic however we&nbsp;can.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"ross\">Julian&nbsp;Ross</a></h3>\n\n<p>Assistant professor, Leiden University, and film&nbsp;programmer</p>\n\n<p>Ross’s recommendations were submitted without&nbsp;comment.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZH6_C7omxM\">El juicio</a> by Ulises de la Orden<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28753636/\">Dau:añcut // Moving Along Image</a> by Adam&nbsp;Piron</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/us/films/silence-of-reason\">Silence of Reason</a> by Kumjana&nbsp;Novakova</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.maryamtafakory.com/mast-del\">Mast-del</a> by Maryam&nbsp;Tafakory</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/us/films/limitation\">Limitation</a> by Elene Asatiani, Soso&nbsp;Dumbadze</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bo-wang.net/an-asian-ghost-story.html\">An Asian Ghost Story</a> by Bo&nbsp;Wang</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/8518\">Still Film</a> by James N.

I chose it from our 2023 video articles because of how it uses a formally simple concept to stage a deep dive into a range of scholarly projects. This is a co-authored video article sharing the research of five academics, who not only speak to the camera about their work but also interact physically with various objects on a sparse kind of set. It is elegantly produced and designed to examine “the personal and intellectual contexts (peri) surrounding academics and their biographies (bio) through audio-visual representation&nbsp;(photy).”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/gb/films/the-world-like-a-jewel-in-the-hand\">The World like a Jewel in the Hand</a> by Ariella&nbsp;Azoulay</p>\n\n<p>This film is technically from 2022 (I don’t know which month), but since this is my first Sight and Sound poll, I have decided to include it. As far as I can tell, it has primarily been screened in 2023. In the film, scholar Ariella Aïsha Azoulay explores the complex history of colonialism between Algeria and Israel, with an emphasis on the gradual erasure of the important figure of the Arab Jew. Azoulay manages to put this history in the broader context of European colonialism in Africa and to interrogate the ongoing practices of colonial museums, all through the simple action of touching and talking about a wide array of books, photographs, mezuzot, and other objects on her desk. When I first saw this film, I immediately felt that it brings an extraordinary depth and power to the concept of the “desktop&nbsp;documentary.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://larissasansour.com/Familiar-Phantoms-2023\">Familiar Phantoms</a> by Larissa Sansour and Søren&nbsp;Lind</p>\n\n<p>I have to confess that I have not seen this film, only the trailer. I recently got a chance to see In the Future They Ate from the Finest Porcelain (2016) and In Vitro (2019) by the same creators. One of the challenges in selecting the “best” video essays from a given year is that so much videographic thought still takes place within the economy of fine arts and is therefore not made available online because it would thereby lose its aura. Larissa Sansour is a Palestinian video artist and filmmaker whose work is powerfully situated and discussed in Gil Z. Hochberg’s book, Becoming Palestine. I am including Familiar Phantoms on my list of selections as the 2023 video work I most wish to&nbsp;see.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p0rya/?hl=en\">A Short Film About Stealing (in Norway)</a> by Pouria&nbsp;Kazemi</p>\n\n<p>I have been able to find very little about Pouria Kazemi online and nothing about this film, which I had the chance to watch when it was submitted to a video festival I co-curated. This short animated video essay is a perfectly composed, brilliantly understated autobiographical statement about the necessity of petty theft under late capitalism. Among the more delightful and poignant touches is that the author’s friends, to protect their anonymity, are given as pseudonyms the names of the Norwegian royal&nbsp;family.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CmBM_gcP1fF/\">Hold On, This Matilda Musical Snapping 💀💀</a> by&nbsp;@wonder_kidd</p>\n\n<p>Hold On, This Matilda Musical Snapping was a TikTok / Instagram trend in which a scene of dynamic choreography from the movie version of the musical Matilda is overlaid by various alternative musical tracks. While putting forward a 25-second social media remix as one of the best video essays of the year is certainly pushing the limits of the form, all the key elements are there: a creative and incisive juxtaposition of a video track with a distinct audio track is contextualised by the critical commentary of a textual annotation. The version I have chosen to link uses @wonder_kidd’s remix of Beyonce’s ‘Cuff It’, a choice that (as many of the Instagram commenters noted) effectively brings out the black cultural roots of Ellen Kane’s choreography, in sharp relief against the massively predominant whiteness of the British schoolchildren who perform it. In just a few seconds, this remix gives us both a snapping new version of Matilda and a cultural critique of how black dance knowledges circulate in predominantly white cultural&nbsp;fields.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"strucci\">Shannon&nbsp;Strucci</a></h3>\n\n<p>Video essayist at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/struccimovies\">StrucciMovies</a>, actual play host on Oddity&nbsp;Roadshow</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkLzC1M7xww\">Colleen Ballinger and Commentary Culture</a> by Ro&nbsp;Ramdin</p>\n\n<p>Ro Ramdin’s work is incredible. Always sharply written, insightful, very funny, beautifully shot, and deeply thoughtful under the meticulous aesthetic and entertaining editing style. She’s one of those essayists I am more than happy to watch even if I have zero interest in the subject matter. I chose this video of hers in particular because I found her reflection on her place in the commentary channel ecosystem navigating the “algorithmic nightmare” of YouTube (as she puts it) especially&nbsp;compelling.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgES_Oj6-tQ\">Does Fresh Garlic Actually Taste Better than Garlic in a Jar?</a> by Ethan&nbsp;Chlebowski</p>\n\n<p>Ethan Chlebowski has made several videos posing the question of whether more expensive versions of the same ingredient are worth it and why, including on balsamic vinegar, olive oil, parmigiano reggiano, vanilla, and, here, garlic. Each video is a deep dive on the cultural history of how the food is used and why, the basics of the culinary science behind it, and Chlebowski doing several taste tests and then giving recommendations at varying price points. While some of his conclusions are down to personal preference, his videos are nevertheless fascinating and done without judgement or pretension. I’d consider them a must-watch for new home cooks or those looking for a great example of engaging educational content that doesn’t&nbsp;condescend.</p>\n\n<drupal-paragraph data-embed-button=\"slice_articles\" data-paragraph-id=\"a3c815c6-8270-4e43-b2d7-46dddf029a8e\" data-paragraph-revision-id=\"719479\" data-paragraph-type=\"video_embed\"></drupal-paragraph>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6lOY-Xx1yw\">Wayfinding Flight Rising Dailies <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Accessibility</a> by <span class=\"caps\">PSJ</span>ulie</p>\n\n<p>I started a Neopets account in elementary school, over twenty years ago. My interest in Neopets or other pet sim sites has long since waned but I’m still fascinated by the work of Pet Simmer Julie, who crafts in-depth videos on virtual pet games. Her depth of knowledge and passion for these games and communities is immediately evident with any of her videos. This video, for example, helped me understand my own problems navigating real-world attractions that had poor wayfinding, and I’ve thought back to it many times after&nbsp;watching.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"tafoya\">Scout&nbsp;Tafoya</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/honorszombiefilms\">Filmmaker</a>, author, video essayist,&nbsp;critic</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/833149389\">Practices of Viewing: Description</a> by Johannes&nbsp;Binotto</p>\n\n<p>A perfect capper to Johannes’ indispensable&nbsp;series</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://trailersfromhell.com/its-a-zabriskie-point-sneak-peek/\">It’s a Zabriskie, Zabriskie, Zabriskie, Zabriskie Point</a> by Daniel&nbsp;Kremer</p>\n\n<p>Daniel finally makes his epic, a great odyssey about why we get lost in&nbsp;movies.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/841294355\">Against Polish or, Notes on Videographic Labor or, You Could Remix Blazing Saddles Today</a> by Will&nbsp;DiGravio</p>\n\n<p>With the insouciance of late Godard or Leos Carax’s New Order music video, Will disassembles our need to&nbsp;assemble.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-quP3u9zYU\">Ozu Without Ozu</a> by Green and&nbsp;Red</p>\n\n<p>Deliciously busy exploration of&nbsp;auteurism.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mediacommons.org/intransition/39-shots\">Once upon a Screen: The 39 Shots</a> by Ariel&nbsp;Avissar</p>\n\n<p>A recontextualisation of what’s in plain&nbsp;sight.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/HAAl3vXHWLs?si=etT2tvEUAoBkmLYd\">Random Acts of Flyness Season 2</a> by Terence&nbsp;Nance</p>\n\n<p>Terence and co’s vibrant and deeply necessary attack on commerce and media’s hideous parasitic relationship is an inspiration to all creators.

Magnificently, this essay doesn’t assume that scholars have more authority than artists, and opts instead to orchestrate a coequal conversation between two of&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://necsus-ejms.org/indians-from-1967-a-reaction/\">Indians from 1967: A Reaction</a> by Ritika&nbsp;Kaushik</p>\n\n<p>A time-capsule doc from 1967 resurfaces recut online and inspires a bevy of reaction videos. Why’d that happen? If we can’t explain why, maybe we can at least reproduce the effect, but with all the tools out in the open. And that’s what this essay does. After a forensics of the recut itself and a cataloguing of the reactions, a little zoom and slow motion unexpectedly imbue me with the same fascination with wonder and impermanence for contemporary online&nbsp;culture.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MUEXGaxFDA\">The <span class=\"caps\">AI</span> Revolution Is Rotten to the Core</a> by Jimmy&nbsp;McGee</p>\n\n<p>This is ground zero of visual culture now, and most of us are either too tired to catch up or hoping it’ll just go away. If you don’t know where to turn, turn here. It’s rigorously researched, historically grounded, theoretically canny, sardonically wise, and as quotable as Casablanca. “We need to choose between building a world for money to live in or building a world for people to live&nbsp;in.”</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"trocan\">Irina&nbsp;Trocan</a></h3>\n\n<p>Freelance <a href=\"https://www.filmsinframe.com/en/interviews/interview-irina-trocan/\">film critic</a>, film studies lecturer at <a href=\"https://scenaristicafilmologie.ro/en/staff/\"><span class=\"caps\">UNATC</span>&nbsp;Bucharest</a></p>\n\n<p>In retrospect, I seem to have compiled a mostly glum list, if not directly referring to contemporary events, at least haunted by&nbsp;them:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sanaz-sohrabi.com/scenes-of-extraction\">Scenes of Extraction</a> by Sanaz&nbsp;Sohrabi</p>\n\n<p>This installation work surveys the history of Iran over several decades, focusing on oil extraction by the foreign company soon to be known as British Petroleum, through a technique called reflection seismography. The challenge, of course, as postcolonial scholarship taught us, is to look beyond the audiovisual self-representation of the company – and the artist accomplishes this extraordinarily well. A voiceover accompanies a collage/montage documenting industrial processes, while the collage in itself operates on the images – which sometimes look like spectral cutouts – workers disconnected from the background, initially black, that slowly takes shape behind them), while at other times these images show their age (for instance, when 1930s maps are juxtaposed with recent <span class=\"caps\">CGI</span>).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB5WVLyADoc\">Between Revolutions</a> by Vlad&nbsp;Petri</p>\n\n<p>Films about revolutions often – and quite paradoxically – treat the event like a solidly contained point on the historical axis, with a beginning and an end, missing exactly their transformative potential and their collective character. One way to avoid this is to resort to the not-entirely-manipulable archives from the depicted era (and not just in short clips to lend the veneer of truth to fictional reenactments), and Between Revolutions is a pretty convincing demonstration of this strategy. Maria and Zahra are fictional med students from Romania and Iran, trying to figure out life amid social turmoil – but the footage, poems and songs that illustrate their journey existed in the world long before the making of this film, and even when made with obvious artistic or educational intent (not to mention elaborate choreography!), these reworked materials contain some trace or emotional truth of their&nbsp;times.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.unifrance.org/movie/56209/this-is-the-end\">This Is the End</a> by Vincent&nbsp;Dieutre</p>\n\n<p>By the most expansive definition a “videographic” work, Dieutre’s Los Angeles pandemic film has, I would argue, a family resemblance with Thom Andersen’s survey of polysemic Californian cityscapes. Love, longing and poetry readings (with actors’/directors’ cameos!) interrupt the grim silence of&nbsp;lockdown.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kortfilm.be/en/watch/she-asked-me-where-i-was\">She Asked Me Where I Was From</a> by Aulona&nbsp;Fetahaj</p>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.kortfilm.be/en/watch/she-asked-me-where-i-was\">reviewed this short film</a> for&nbsp;Kortfilm.be.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://indielisboa.com/en/film/incident/\">Incident</a> by Bill&nbsp;Morrison</p>\n\n<p>Bill Morrison is known to be interested in film only when it is analogue and beautifully degraded, and in this respect the <span class=\"caps\">CCTV</span>/bodycam-sourced Incident is a long distance from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/734548266\">Buried News</a>. The killing of Harith Augustus by the Chicago police was previously examined by Forensic Architecture to persuasively oppose the authorities’ version of the event, but Morrison and Jamie Kalven at the Invisible Institute set out to do something else. The 30-minute film, often showing in split-screen multiple angles and parallel events, only tracks a short span of time, although 1) it seems dispiritingly endless and 2) it already anticipates the community’s reaction to seeing yet another African American killed, while the policemen, in an onlooker’s phrasing, “get their story straight”. Augustus’s lifeless body is present in the frame for a long stretch of the runtime, contrary to the <span class=\"caps\">CPD</span>’s attempt to erase the “accident” from memory, while the eloquent rage of everyone in the community seems tragically rehearsed in similar prior events. The victim’s neighbours don’t get to express solidarity, but the colleagues of the policemen who fired the gun can, and do, help erase criminal&nbsp;guilt.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/e6cd089c-4c04-4903-8bd9-91b78e78ffaf/makeover-movie/\">Makeover Movie</a> by Sue&nbsp;Ding</p>\n\n<p>You’d think this is the second-oldest topic in the feminist book (immediately after suffrage), but makeovers seem here to stay. Just look at what the too-radical teen in Barbie has to go through, or scroll down any social media app on a new account. Luckily, well-informed critiques, spanning many decades of <span class=\"caps\">US</span> films, and listing all the problematic tropes implicit in the “makeover” are also competing for our attention. I can only hope that more young spectators see “The Makeover Movie”, where Sue Ding conjures a multiracial telephone slumber party with her girlfriends to understand how these films taught them “not only how to be a woman, but also how to be American”. Teen classics provide most material, but a handful of musicals plus Desplechin’s A Christmas Tale and Vertigo also fit the&nbsp;bill.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/828945268\">Screen Stars Dictionary.

Therefore, I owe Veronika and Jiří many thanks and a loud high-five for allowing me to mention her again as a media scholar in my 30s. Autobiography aside, this playful video is a throwback to 2000s <span class=\"caps\">TV</span> series, music clips and shows, computer interfaces, and a persuasive argument about how the model-periphery theory of dissemination is a far from rigorous&nbsp;model.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"vanau\">Ilinca&nbsp;Vânău</a></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ilincavanau.com/\">Film programmer and&nbsp;researcher</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXBlyRnECM0\">Where Is Little Trixie?</a> by Carlos&nbsp;Baixauli</p>\n\n<p>A very moving work that packs a lot of wonder and attentive detail in under four minutes, building a bridge between the works of two women filmmakers more than a century&nbsp;apart.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/813866030\">Who Speaks?

Kienitz&nbsp;Wilkins</p>\n\n<p>The latest film by James N. Kienitz Wilkins is an intriguing and exhausting audio play voiced by the director, who plays the four main characters in a court inquiry about film memories, film still photographers, Kodak as a pharmaceutical enterprise, the negative aura of Tom Hanks, boom operators, and the elusiveness of Hollywood as a cultural agent. All of this is put together with a seemingly random selection of film stills. As usual, in Kienitz Wilkins’ work, discourse is moving and images are&nbsp;ecstatic.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://maximemartinot.com/le-film-que-vous-allez-voir\">Le film que vous allez voir</a> by Maxime&nbsp;Martinot</p>\n\n<p>Maxime Martinot’s 11-minute film is an immensely funny compilation of disclaimer cards presented at the beginning of films throughout history. Edited as a frantic accumulation of non-images, we expect the worst and suffer the anticipation of immoral, violent, or graphic images. Without the images themselves, we are left with an essay on morality and sensibility as they evolve through time and shape the way we see the world around us and&nbsp;ourselves.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.film-documentaire.fr/4DACTION/w_fiche_film/66783_0\">Où en êtes-vous, Tsai Ming-Liang?</a> by Tsai&nbsp;Ming-Liang</p>\n\n<p>A 20-minute meditation by the greatest living filmmaker on back pain, the pleasure of sitting, the beauty of chairs and how to paint&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mk2films.com/en/film/room-999/\">Chambre 999</a> by Lubna&nbsp;Playoust</p>\n\n<p>A conceptual remake of Wim Wenders’ Chambre 666, made 40 years later.

Excellent pacing and vocal delivery communicates the tone of the map, and becomes a jumping off point for an analysis of horror in gaming / the oft-discussed topic of liminal spaces.

DeLisio’s commentary includes text elements that are ingeniously expressed in a similar visual language to the film’s (faded, grainy, blurry).

Talk about ‘embodied practice’: hard for me to imagine a more clear example than Alexandre projecting the edited video text onto their own body for the entirety of this video. An interruption a few minutes in from YouTube’s algorithm –a split-screen beer advert no less– just added to the gag on my viewing. And throughout the to-camera presentation, I found my eye drawn off to the Minecraft parkour constantly, in a clever proving of Alexandre’s argument. Behind the overstimulating presentation, Alexandre’s analysis offers an insightful categorisation of a media type inexplicable on the surface but ever-present in the developing digital&nbsp;landscape.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Vlu-Ffdxocc?si=4vunJSQgj2dgdkBh\">The Man/Car Gender Binary in John Carpenter’s Christine</a> by max&nbsp;teeth</p>\n\n<p>The breezy recap of the man/car binary in the opening moments of max teeth’s essay is authoritative, funny, and thought-provoking – everything a video essay can be, especially on YouTube.

Seinpeaks illustrates the fine line beautifully. It’s a long-running project mashing up Twin Peaks and Seinfeld (with guest appearances from other stalwart shows like Always Sunny and Friends). These two shows aired simultaneously and their shared visual language provides a jumping-off point for a surprising collab that draws out the humour in Twin Peaks and the absurdism in&nbsp;Seinfeld.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"woodward\">Adam&nbsp;Woodward</a></h3>\n\n<p>Editor-at-large and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@lwlies\">YouTube channel</a> manager at <a href=\"https://lwlies.com/\">Little White Lies&nbsp;magazine</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrXFHUW5Uk\">How Jane Campion Subverts the Violence of the Male Gaze</a> by Carly&nbsp;Mattox</p>\n\n<p>This was an idea pitched to me around focusing on the image of the woman on the street in cinema, especially at night, and especially in films directed by women.

It’s a visual and intellectual rollercoaster that will leave you in awe from start to&nbsp;finish.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://criticalcommons.org/view?m=Twhjate9p\"><span class=\"caps\">RAWR</span> </a>by Maud&nbsp;Ceuterick</p>\n\n<p>Beginning as a creative spark in an Aarhus workshop, it expanded at Middlebury College to become a true gem. Drawing from Judith Butler’s groundbreaking work, Ceuterick passionately interprets and deforms scenes of female rage, challenging gender norms. This transformative journey echoes Audre Lorde’s call for a radical change through the expression of rage. It’s a brilliant fusion of scholarship and&nbsp;creativity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://62c94e7dc27d5.site123.me/\">This is Not What I Normally Do: An Insignificant Step in the Downfall of the Humanities</a> by Ariel&nbsp;Avissar</p>\n\n<p>This is <span class=\"caps\">THE</span> video essay of the year. A bold departure from convention, this video defies expectations with its remarkable layers of provocation. Meticulously edited and expertly crafted, it pushes the boundaries of videographic criticism, skilfully weaving a captivating tapestry of thought-provoking insights in the&nbsp;field</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/816886504\">Sound Before Picture </a>by Cormac&nbsp;Donnelly</p>\n\n<p>One of the most captivating sound projects I’ve ever encountered. This video essay ventures into uncharted territory, pairing the audio from the beginning of films with the closing images, creating an extraordinary mosaic of sound and visuals. The result is an auditory and visual tapestry that defies conventional expectations. It’s a seamless blend of the familiar and the unexpected, challenging our perception of film&nbsp;narratives.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/830585666\">169 Seconds: Una mujer reflejada / A Reflected Woman</a> by Catherine&nbsp;Grant</p>\n\n<p>In this brief but profoundly impactful exploration, Catherine Grant manages to distil the essence of the film’s themes, performances, and significance with remarkable precision, a testament to the art of succinct and effective storytelling. It’s a research gem that demonstrates the power of brevity in conveying complex ideas. In just 169 seconds, this video essay is the best piece of research ever “written” on Sebastián Lelio’s&nbsp;film.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/lacurieo\">Xena’s Body: A Menstrual Auto-Investigation Using an iPhone</a> by Occitane&nbsp;Lacurie</p>\n\n<p>This provocative video essay skillfully employs desktop editing on an iPhone to present a feminist perspective on the enduring control of women’s bodies through the dissemination of misinformation about menstruation and the menstruation apps. It is an awe-inspiring blend of resourcefulness, scholarly research, activism, art, exceptional editing skills, and&nbsp;creativity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zfmedienwissenschaft.de/online/videography-blog/sensous-and-affective\">Sensuous and Affective: The Potential of Videography for Studying Audio-Visual Relations</a> by Oswald&nbsp;Iten</p>\n\n<p>A beautifully edited and profoundly insightful exploration of the dynamic interplay between sight and&nbsp;sound.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#voters\">Back to list of&nbsp;voters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Emerging&nbsp;voices</h2>\n\n<p>The voters had the option to nominate essayists to the ‘Emerging voices’ section as a way to highlight new and exciting talent in the video essay&nbsp;space.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@acollierastro\">acollierastro</a> (nominated by Ben&nbsp;Chinapen)</p>\n\n<p>[Ben also nominated this creator’s video on string theory in the main poll, and resubmitted his explanation from there to clarify why he was nominating them for Emerging&nbsp;voices.]</p>\n\n<p>This video came out of nowhere and blew everyone’s mind who saw it. An intriguing title, with a clearly stressed-out person and also The Binding of Isaac in the thumbnail? What’s going on? Within one minute the purpose becomes clear; this woman who has very strong opinions and credentials will break down exactly what happened with the String Theory phenomenon while simultaneously stumbling through a playthrough of the vintage roguelike indie darling Binding of Isaac. A premise so absurd and hilarious (dare I say groundbreaking?) that you instantly want to watch and listen. It’s very informative and <span class=\"caps\">HIGHLY</span> entertaining for the joke of the idea alone. I’m glad this took off because it was worth it. This is probably my most firm nomination out of the&nbsp;group.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://morganefrund.ch/\">Morgane Frund</a> (nominated by Delphine&nbsp;Jeanneret)</p>\n\n<p>Morgane Frund was born in 1997 in Lausanne, Switzerland. She studied Film Studies, English and German at the University of Lausanne. From 2019 to 2022, she studied Video at Hochschule Luzern, Design and Kunst, graduating with a Bachelor degree. <span class=\"caps\">BEAR</span> (2022), her graduation film, screened in numerous festivals and won several prizes. <span class=\"caps\">OUT</span> <span class=\"caps\">OF</span> <span class=\"caps\">THE</span> <span class=\"caps\">BLUE</span> (2023) premiered in competition at the Internationale Kurzfilmtage Winterthur. She is active in the fields of documentary film, video essay and performance&nbsp;arts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://juliaborderie.com/en/duo-eloise-le-gallo-julia-borderie/\">Eloïse Le Gallo and Julia Borderie</a> (nominated by Delphine&nbsp;Jeanneret)</p>\n\n<p>Born in 1989, Julia Borderie and Éloïse Le Gallo have been a duo since 2016. They graduated from Le Fresnoy in 2023. In an exploratory mode, they approach water as a substance that influences the territories it flows through and the bodies that live in it. Taking a poetic, documentary approach, they make the experience of otherness a condition of artistic creation. The camera eye acts as a catalyst for encounters, while questioning the human gestures that shape materials and&nbsp;territories.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of a mesh of viewpoints and disciplines (craft techniques, geology, chemistry, marine biology, etc.) and at the crossroads of sculpture and cinema, they are interested in the origin of the materials that form a landscape. Recently, their research has led them to question more specifically the complementarities between learned form and sensitive form, working with scientists on objects generated by their cutting edge technologies. [Bio from Le&nbsp;Fresnoy]</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zfmedienwissenschaft.de/online/videography-blog/nao-veio-dos-ceus-nem-das-maos-de-isabel\">Rodrigo Campos</a> (nominated by Evelyn&nbsp;Kreutzer)</p>\n\n<p>Campos participated in a mentorship program I co-organised with Anna-Sophie Pilippi, Maike Reinerth, and Kathleen Loock, as part of the Videography conference in Hanover 2022. There he worked with Barbara Zecchi. The resulting video, published in the ZfM Videography blog this year, is a deeply poetic, affective, and analytically profound investigation of Brazilian colonial screen&nbsp;history.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://maifeminism.com/call-for-proposals-doing-womens-global-horror-film-history/\">Doing Women’s Global Horror Film History Collaboration</a> (nominated by Colleen&nbsp;Laird)</p>\n\n<p>A collaboration of 30 makers, the Doing Women’s Global Horror Film History project has been in the works since an original call for proposals in February 2022. Although just a few of the participants are experienced (full disclosure: myself included), the grant-funded project was designed by Alison Peirse to train and mentor new talent from around the globe through a series of online videographic workshops over the course of approximately six months. Thereafter, participants would produce their first video essay and would refine their edits through online peer feedback. As one of the collaborators, it has been my great privilege to see the works of so many new creators grow and evolve and I am excited for their collective debut. The collaboration will be published online in the first quarter of 2023 in the journal <a href=\"https://maifeminism.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">MAI</span>: Feminism <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Visual Culture</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXBlyRnECM0\">Carlos Baixauli</a> (nominated by Adrian&nbsp;Martin)</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, audiovisual essays can do a simple thing very well. Baixauli’s ingenious mix of the silent Falling Leaves (1912) by Alice Guy with Céline Sciamma’s Petite Maman (2021) hits that&nbsp;spot.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@greenandred3174\">Green <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Red (Kasra Karbasi and Mohammad Amin Komijani)</a> (nominated by Adrian&nbsp;Martin)</p>\n\n<p>These Iranian cinephiles pursue very original film&nbsp;analyses.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cinentransit.com/friends-y-el-inconsciente-de-las-imagenes/\">Martín Vilela</a> (nominated by Adrian&nbsp;Martin)</p>\n\n<p>Like Cooper in Twin Peaks: The Return, Chandler from Friends is multiplied and interacts with himself, uncannily. In Argentina, Vilela’s&nbsp;country!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.maillim.com/\">May Santiago</a> (nominated by Dayna&nbsp;McLeod)</p>\n\n<p>A queer Puerto Rican feminist filmmaker, May Santiago’s unique voice and perspective makes her a video essayist to watch out for. She will have new work in Alison Peirse’s Doing Women’s (Global) (Horror) Film History (<span class=\"caps\">DWGHFH</span>) project which will be featured in a special issue of <span class=\"caps\">MAI</span> Feminism <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Visual Culture in 2024. I was lucky enough to see May’s practice first hand at Embodying the Video Essay, a videographic workshop in Maine this summer and was blown away by May’s spectacularly intricate and layered work. She crafts soundtracks to complement a unique and riveting visual language, combining archive and horror while using herself as narrator and performing subject in front of the camera. Do keep an eye out for May’s work at film festivals and online: <a href=\"https://www.maillim.com/\">https://www.maillim.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Svanik Surve (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@SUAVEcritic\"><span class=\"caps\">SUAVE</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@SUAVEcine\"><span class=\"caps\">SUAVE</span> cinema</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@svaniksuave\">svanik <span class=\"caps\">SUAVE</span></a>) (nominated by Queline&nbsp;Meadows)</p>\n\n<p>Svanik Surve has been making video essays steadily for a few years now, but expanded his output in 2023 when he created two new YouTube channels. This year, his work explored Indian culture, international art cinema, and philosophy. His creative, intelligent, and funny videos deserve a much larger&nbsp;audience.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@framemygaze\">framemygaze</a> (nominated by Queline&nbsp;Meadows)</p>\n\n<p>In my eyes, there is nobody more immersed in the YouTube media and culture video essay landscape than framemygaze, and I say that as someone who runs a Discord server for video essay creators! I’ve found her in the comment sections of countless videos writing detailed notes that reflect her care and close attention to everything she watches. Framemygaze has only released one video so far, but if her deep understanding of the video essay community is any indication, there will be many more great videos in the&nbsp;future.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AliceCappelle\">Alice Cappelle</a> (nominated by Michael <span class=\"caps\">O’N</span>eill&nbsp;Burns)</p>\n\n<p>Alice’s videos offer an intriguing perspective at the borders of Francophile and Anglophile culture. She’s a French creator making videos in English, often about topics and phenomena specific to English language digital spaces and culture. This perspective allows her to use the critical force of a French leftist theorist to tackle seemingly vapid and conceptually empty trends and practices. At other times, she’s able to translate the specificity of the French political moment to a broader audience in a way that’s far more accessible than standard news&nbsp;coverage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@SkipIntroYT\">Jackson Maher </a>(nominated by Michael <span class=\"caps\">O’N</span>eill&nbsp;Burns)</p>\n\n<p>Jackson is an already accomplished editor who in recent years has put himself in front of the camera to create video essays that lure viewers in with analysis of popular media properties, but uses this as the occasion to expose deeper cultural ideologies buried within pop culture. His series of videos on Copaganda does a masterful job at showing us how the logic of policing has infected so much of our culture, down to popular children’s programme Paw Patrol. But maybe most impressively, Jackson does all this while being relatable and curious, never making the viewer feel judged but instead inviting us to dig deeper alongside&nbsp;him.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/-aRSLSAzbI8?si=HzPnuI05Lo8CfK7r\">Lara Isobel Callaghan</a> (nominated by Will&nbsp;Webb)</p>\n\n<p>Lara is a new face on the video-essay scene, with a number of commissions across Little White Lies and the <span class=\"caps\">BFI</span>. Although the commissioned work is excellent, I’m highlighting this video from the Essay Library collab, When Essay Met Library, due to its formal inventiveness and cheeky sense of humour. Using Hindi film Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan as a jumping off point, Lara examines Shakespeare’s influence on the rom-com genre through the lens of a 1980s infomercial. William Shakespeare’s Course of True Love: available&nbsp;now!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mediapolisjournal.com/2023/09/screen-journeys/\">Jemma Saunders</a> (nominated by Will&nbsp;Webb)</p>\n\n<p>A doctoral researcher at the University of Birmingham, Jemma’s particular focus on sense of place (and Birmingham especially) comes to the fore in this fascinating essay examining automotive representations of the city. Other works in this vein include <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/787317723\">Reaching Out Remotely</a>, covering <span class=\"caps\">UK</span> soap Doctors’ covid episode, made all the more poignant by its cancellation this&nbsp;year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.carlymattox.com/\">Carly Mattox</a> (nominated by Adam&nbsp;Woodward)</p>\n\n<p>I met Carly in late 2022 when I gave a talk to the second year students at <span class=\"caps\">NFTS</span>.

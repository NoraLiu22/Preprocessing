We therefore strictly adhere to the legal provisions governing the admissibility of the handling of personal data and have taken appropriate technical and organisational precautions. The following declaration gives you an overview of how we guarantee this protection and what kind of data we collect for what purpose.</p><h3 class="typoHs">1. Scope of the processing of personal data</h3><p>We only collect and use our users’ personal data of insofar as this is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our contents and services. The collection and use of our users’ personal data takes place regularly and only with the user's consent. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for real reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.</p><p>Fazit Communication GmbH is entitled, with your voluntary consent, to collect, process and store, combine with other data, archive and use your personal data for the purpose of providing information about&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazit Communication GmbH products.

Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h3><p>Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, art. 6 para. 1 lit. a EU Data Protection Ordinance (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data. In the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. Insofar as the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis. In the event of the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person requiring the processing of personal data, article 6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis. If processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.</p><h3 class="typoHs">3. Data erasure and storage time</h3><p>The personal data of the person concerned will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the person responsible is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.</p><h2 class="typoHm">II.

Remarketing</h3><p>The websites use the Google Inc. "("Google") remarketing or "similar target group" function. This feature allows visitors to the sites to be targeted with advertisements by personalized, interest-based ads being delivered to visitors to the sites when they visit other sites on the Google Display Network. Google uses cookies to analyze website usage, which forms the basis for creating interest-based advertisements. Google stores a small file with a sequence of numbers in the browsers of visitors to the website. This number is used to record visits to the website and anonymised data on the use of the website. No personal data of visitors to the website are stored. If you subsequently visit another website in the Google Display Network, you will see ads that are highly likely to include previously accessed product and information areas.</p><p>You can disable the use of cookies by third parties by visiting the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> and implementing the additional opt-out information mentioned therein.</p><p>For more information about Google Remarketing and Google's privacy policy, please visit: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/</a></p><p>On some of our websites we use the remarketing function "Custom Audiences" of Facebook Inc. (1601 p. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA; "Facebook").</p><p>This function serves the purpose of targeting the visitors of the website with interest-related advertising on Facebook.</p><p>For this purpose, the Facebook remarketing tag was implemented on the website. This tag establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers while visiting the website transferring to the Facebook server which of our pages you have visited. Facebook maps this information to your personal Facebook account. When you visit the Facebook social network, you will see personalized, interest-based Facebook ads.</p><p>To object to the processing of your personal data, you can deactivate the remarketing function "Custom Audiences" at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen">https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen</a>.

Legal basis for data processing</h3><p>The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of establishing contact is art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If the e-mail contact aims at the conclusion of a contract, then additional legal basis for the processing is art. 6 exp. 1 lit. b GDPR.</p><h3 class="typoHs">3.

Duration of storage</h3><p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. For the personal data from the input mask of the contact form and those that were sent by e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation with the user is finished. The conversation is terminated when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the matter has been clarified once and for all.</p><p>If statutory provisions provide for retention obligations (e.g. six years for commercial letters received, section 257 (4) of the German Commercial Code(HGB)), deletion shall take place after expiry of the corresponding period.</p><h2 class="typoHm">V. Data provided by you</h2><h3 class="typoHs">1. Description and scope of data processing</h3><p>In some areas of the site, you may be asked to provide personal information in order to use the offers or free features described or to participate in special promotions (subscription orders, product orders, editorial or advertising newsletters, participation in competitions or other promotions). You will be informed about which information you must provide for these offers and which data you can voluntarily provide.</p><p>In particular, the following data may be collected: Name, address, bank details, password, date of birth, e-mail address, declarations of consent, information on the concluded legal transaction.</p><p>To fulfill your order or registration we pass your data on to partners, who in turn act in conformity with the data protection regulations.</p><p>You can apply at any time to have your customer account deleted at datenschutz(*)fazit-communication(.)de.</p><p>When subscribing to a newsletter, the user receives a confirmation message after registration, which contains a link to the final registration (double opt-in). This ensures that the newsletter is explicitly desired.</p><p>You can unsubscribe from the newsletter via a personalized link that will be sent with each mailing.</p><h3 class="typoHs">2. Legal basis for data processing</h3><p>If the purpose of data collection is to conclude a contract, the legal basis for processing is art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, data will be processed on the basis of a consent given by you (art 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).</p><h3 class="typoHs">3. Purpose of data processing</h3><p>The data is processed for the purpose of enabling the use of the respective offers and functions. Inasmuch as you provide further data voluntarily, we use them to design our services according to your needs.</p><h3 class="typoHs">4. Duration of storage</h3><p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. This is usually the case if the service you have used (e.g. newsletter order, creation of a personal user profile) is cancelled.</p><p>If statutory provisions provide for retention obligations (e.g. six years for commercial letters received, section 257 (4) HGB), deletion shall take place after expiry of the corresponding period.</p><h2>VI. Use of the app</h2><h3>1. Downloading the app</h3><p>When downloading the app, the required information is transferred to the respective app store (Google Play / Apple App Store, / Amazon App Store, USA), i.e. in particular user name, email address and customer number of your account, time of download, payment information if applicable and an individual device identifier. We have no influence on this data collection and processing and are not responsible for it. Details on the use of data by the app store operators can be found in their data protection declarations.</p><h3>2. Data processing for the provision of the service</h3><p>Your IP address, device identifiers (e.g. UDID, DeviceID), device name, installed app version and operating system version of your terminal device are processed by us for the installation, enabling and provision of the service (e.g. for troubleshooting) (Art.6 para.1 b, f DSGVO). Providing you with the best possible service is our legitimate interest, insofar as we process your data on this legal basis. The data will be deleted in our access area by us for this purpose when it is no longer required for enabling and providing the service, unless there are legal storage obligations.</p><h3>3. Sending push messages in apps</h3><p>Push messages are information that is sent to your end device and displayed there in a prioritised manner. Without your consent, which can be revoked at any time, the app only sends push messages to notify you of a change to these data protection provisions or contractual information about the app (Art. 6 para.1 a, b DSGVO). In order to send you push messages, we process your device identifier (device ID). You can revoke your consent in the system settings of your smartphone or mobile device. You can therefore unsubscribe from push messages there.</p><h3>4. Advertising ID</h3><p>The system providers of your device operating systems (e.g. Apple, Google) generate a so-called advertising ID for your end device by default. As the provider of the app, we initially have no influence on this. The advertising ID is used in part to collect information about user behaviour and may be made available to third-party providers or used by them, for example, to optimise advertisements for you and to make them available in line with your predicted interests, also by the system providers. You can reset your advertising ID via the settings of your terminal device or prevent its use.</p><h2 class="typoHm">VII. Use of social media links or plug-ins</h2><h3 class="typoHs">1.

By pressing the button next to the respective plug-in, the plug-in is activated, which is indicated by the color change of the plug-in button from gray to colored. Then you can use the respective plug-in by clicking on the button of the plug-in. Please note that we are not providers of social networks and have no influence on data processing by the respective service providers. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is, insofar as personal data are processed here, art. 6 para. 1 f EU GDPR, whereby our legitimate interest consists in the provision of interaction possibilities for the purpose of advertising (recital 47 EU GDPR) and in the demand-oriented design of our Internet services for interaction with social networks to which the users of our website belong.</p><p>More details about the individual plug-ins can be found in the following information:</p><h3 class="typoHs">2. Facebook/Instagram</h3><p>Our pages include plug-ins from the social network "Facebook", 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.

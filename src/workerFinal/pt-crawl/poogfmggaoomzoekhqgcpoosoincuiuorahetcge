		<h1 class="center_text">Neil Young</h1>
		<p>Neil Percival Young (born November 12, 1945, Toronto, Ontario) 
		is a Canadian singer-songwriter, musician and film director.</p>
		<p>
		The Youngtown Museum is named in tribute to one of Canada&#39;s 
		most outstanding Singers , Songwriters, and Musicians ... Neil Young.&nbsp; 
		Neil spend his early childhood in the village of Omemee and the Young 
		Family history continued in the area through Neil&#39;s father (Canadian 
		Journalist and Author) Scott Young who lived near town until his passing 
		in 2005. The museum is not directly affiliated with Neil Young or his 
		family but pays respects to the artist and his family through an amazing 
		exhibit of memorabilia, photo&#39;s, and music.</p>
		<p>Young&#39;s work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive 
		guitar work, and signature falsetto tenor singing voice. Although he 
		accompanies himself on several different instrumentsâincluding piano and 
		harmonicaâhis style of claw-hammer acoustic guitar and often 
		idiosyncratic soloing on electric guitar are the linchpins of a 
		sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has 
		experimented widely with differing music styles, including swing, jazz, 
		rockabilly, blues, and electronic music throughout a varied career, his 
		best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles: folk-esque 
		acoustic rock (as heard in songs such as &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; 
		and &quot;Old Man&quot;) and electric-charged hard rock (in songs like &quot;Cinnamon 
		Girl&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#39; in the Free World&quot; and &quot;Hey Hey, My My (Into the 
		Black)&quot;). In more recent years, Young has started to adopt elements from 
		newer styles of music, such as industrial, alternative country and 
		grunge, the latter of which was profoundly influenced by his own style 
		of playing, causing some to confer on him the title of &quot;the godfather of 
		grunge&quot;.</p>
		<p>Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the 
		pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past 
		(1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), 
		Greendale (2003), and CSNY DÃ©jÃ  Vu (2008), a documentary 
		about the band&#39;s controversial 2006 &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; tour. He is 
		currently working on another documentary about new technology for 
		automobiles, tentatively titled &quot;Linc/Volt&quot;.</p>
		<p>He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small 
		farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid, and in 
		1986 helped found The Bridge School, and its annual supporting Bridge 
		School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young&#39;s 
		involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons 
		have cerebral palsy and his daughter, like Young himself, has epilepsy).</p>
		<p>Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths 
		(Pocahontas, space stations, and the settlement of the American West), 
		as he does about his native country (such as in &quot;Helpless&quot; and &quot;Four 
		Strong Winds&quot;), he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to 
		relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for &quot;so 
		long&quot; and has stated, about U.S. elections, that he has &quot;got just as 
		much right to vote in them as anybody else.&quot;</p>

<h1>R Sources</h1>

<h2>Official releases</h2>

Official releases of R source code are most likely what you want if
you are looking for the sources of R (both Unix and Windows).
<ul>
  <li> The latest release (2024-04-24, Puppy Cup):
  <a href="src/base/R-4/R-4.4.0.tar.gz">R-4.4.0.tar.gz</a><br>
  Changes to the previous version are documented in the file <a
  href="doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html">NEWS</a> (also contained in the sources).
  
  <li>Older releases are available <a href="src/base/">here</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Snapshots</h2>

Snapshots of R sources for development and patched release
versions can be obtained as gzipped and bzipped tar files
from <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R/daily/">
https://stat.ethz.ch/R/daily/</a>:
<ul>
  <li>Sources of
    <a href="src/base-prerelease/">R alpha and beta releases</a>
    (daily snapshots, created only in time periods before a planned
    release).
  </li>
  <li>The latest patched release:
    <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R/daily/R-patched.tar.gz">
    R-patched.tar.gz</a>, 
    <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R/daily/R-patched.tar.xz">
    R-patched.tar.xz</a> (read
    <a href="doc/manuals/r-patched/NEWS.html">what's new</a>
    in the latest patched version).
  </li>
  <li>The latest development release:
    <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R/daily/R-devel.tar.gz">
    R-devel.tar.gz</a>, 
    <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R/daily/R-devel.tar.xz">
    R-devel.tar.xz</a> (read
    <a href="doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html">what's new</a>
    in the latest devel version).
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
After downloading the R sources you should also download the recommended
packages by entering the R source tree and running
<pre>
    tools/rsync-recommended
</pre>
from a shell command line.

<p>
<!-- Note that there is currently no anonymous cvs access to the R -->
<!-- sources. -->
The above archives are created automatically from the Subversion tree,
hence might not even compile on your platform and can contain any number
of bugs. They will probably work, but maybe not. Use them to verify
whether a bug you're tracking has been fixed or a new feature you always
wanted has already been implemented.
<p>
CRAN itself does no longer mirror source snapshots (as of 2001-11-14),
because it makes only limited sense to propagate archives that change
on a daily basis through a network of mirror sites. When a snapshot
reaches one of the final nodes in the mirroring process, there are
already 2 newer versions available at the orginal sites.

    One of the methods developed in the 1920s for recording audio for movies was 
    the variable area optical sound track. Photographic film stock was exposed 
    to light modulated by the signal to be recorded. When a positive was printed 
    the result was a clear area of varying width. The photo actually shows a piece 
    of film recorded by the Philips-Miller, apparently a recording of a constant 
    frequency. Playback is achieved by projecting a narrow slit of light onto 
    the film and detecting the amount of light passing through using a photo-electric 
    cell. A recording method like that used for cinema films, which required time 
    for the photographic film to be processed before the recording could be played, 
    would not have been suitable for broadcast use. Instead of using the optical/chemical 
    method the Philips-Miller machine recorded mechanically. <br />
    <br />
    <div class="atR"><img src="pm/pm_cutter-angle.gif" width="384" height="300" alt="The cutter" title="The cutter and film" /></div>
    The film was 7mm wide, 0.18mm thick and consisted of three layers. The celluloid 
    base was coated with a layer of gelatine on which was applied a very thin 
    opaque coating of mercuric sulphide. A sapphire cutter with an obtuse tip 
    angle (174 degrees) moved vertically, cutting through the opaque layer into 
    the gelatine. The deeper it cut the wider was the amount removed from the 
    opaque layer. The resulting recording was played optically, just like a cinema 
    film. <br />
    <br />
    Some early experimenters had attempted to record on film using lateral cuts, 
    but it was J. A. Miller of Flushing, N.Y. who developed the vertical cut idea 
    in 1931. The following year he reached an agreement with the Philips research 
    laboratory at Eindhoven on the use of his patents and further development 
    work.<br />
    <br />
    Philips provided some experimental equipment for the BBC to test in November 
    1934 and a preliminary quotation was made the following January. The equipment 
    was priced at &pound;4500 and the running costs would have been &pound;20 
    per hour. In February 1936, and after some negotiating, a six month trial 
    <div class="sideBoxR"> 
      <div class="sideBoxCaption">Maida Vale</div>
      <div class="sideBoxBody">The building housing Maida Vale Studios began as 
        a roller skating rink c.1914. It was acquired by the BBC in 1934. Five 
        studios were built within the shell (a sixth added much later). It also 
        housed several recording channels, there because of lack of space at Broadcasting 
        House.</div>
    </div>
    of a machine at Maida Vale was agreed. For this the BBC would pay &pound;1,000. 
    The initial film width of 17mm was reduced to 7mm which helped get the running 
    costs down to &pound;7 per hour.Tests conducted at Eindhoven were very encouraging. 
    The performance figures included a frequency response of +/-2.5dB between 
    50Hz and 7kHz, total distortion of 3.5% at 30% modulation at 1kHz and noise 
    at least 50dB below full modulation. The equipment was installed in Room 21, 
    Maida Vale and formally handed over on 1 June 1936.<br />
    <br />
    Problems soon became apparent. Imperfections in the film could produce spurious 
    modulations and distortion. There was a breakdown during transmission and 
    the machine had to be taken out of service to allow the engineers time to 
    sort out the problems. It was back in use by October and then gave excellent 
    results. Even at &pound;7 per hour the running costs were considered to be 
    quite high. This made the machine inappropriate for use on the Empire Service 
    where the superior quality would be wasted on short-wave reception.<br />
    <br />
    By this time, direct-cut discs were becoming established and producers were 
    enjoying the ability to easily and rapidly pick out a section of a recording 
    without having to spool through film or tape. But the Philips-Miller had considerable 
    advantages when it came to making a permanent recording of a programme. It 
    was cheaper than processed discs and offered better quality, negligible deterioration 
    after repeated plays, superior reliability and the possibility of editing. 
    <br />
    <br />
    <div class="atR"><img src="pm/pm_4.jpg" width="450" height="416" alt="Machines and bay" title="Edit suite at Maida Vale in 1938" /></div>
    Negotiations began for a new contract with Philips. It was suggested that 
    running costs could be reduced by making two recordings on each film, using 
    two tracks. The film speed could be reduced from 32 to 20cm/sec. This reduced 
    the running cost to &pound;2.50 per hour. The first of the new machines went 
    into service on 28th March 1938 at a charge of &pound;800 p.a. plus a &pound;1250 
    royalty. A second machine was hired as a standby at a lower rental.<br />
    <br />
    Recordings requiring the highest quality were still made at 32 cm/sec, but 
    other recordings used the new, lower speed, albeit with some loss at frequencies 
    above 4kHz. A few weeks were left before making a second recording on a film 
    in case editing of the first programme was required. At the higher recording 
    speed a spool ran for fifteen minutes. <br />

    <br />
    Each installation consisted of two combined machines placed side by side in 
    a single unit to form a complete channel capable of continuous recording or 
    <div class="atR"><img src="pm/pm_layout.gif" width="482" height="347" alt="Layout diagram" title="General layout" />

    reproduction. Most of the associated electronics were accomodated in bays.<br />
    <br />
    The main drive consisted of a 3-phase synchronous motor which drove the recording 
    drum through a heavy flywheel.<br />
    <br />
    Some machines used the same motor to drive the spools, through friction clutches 
    which were regulated by pivoted levers resting on the outside of the spools. 
    Other machines used two extra motors to drive the spools.<br clear="right" />
    <br />

    </div>
    The recording drum not only drove the film but also acted as a base supporting 
    the film during the cutting operation. The surface of the drum had to be mirror 
    smooth; an irregularity of a thousandth of an inch could cause a variation 
    of track width almost equal to 100 per cent modulation. In fact, the drum 
    diameter had to be accurate to 1/40,000th of an inch. Extreme cleanliness 
    was vital as a single speck of dust could cause distortion.<br />
    <br />
    Some method of removing the swarf created by the cutting process would have 
    been required. In this photo there appears to be a tube running from the recording 
    head towards the right hand spool - this is probably part of a vacuum system.<br />
    <br />
    In order to drive the film a rubber-faced pressure roller pressed it against 
    the recording drum. Early attempts to use perforated film driven by sprockets, 
    like cinema film, had resulted in unacceptable flutter.<br />
    <br />
    The recording head consisted of a brass block with the electro-mechanical 
    movement at one end and a micrometer screw adjustment, used to control the 
    depth of cut, at the other. There was an automatic device which withdrew the 
    cutter to produce minimum width of cut during silent periods, thus reducing 
    noise. <br clear="all" />
    <br />
    <div class="atR"><img src="pm/pm_repro.gif" width="350" height="195" alt="The replay system" title="The replay system" /> 
    </div>
    In the replay system, light from the exciter lamp was focused by a lens on 
    a slit cut in a disk. This disk could be rotated by a screw mechanism to ensure 
    that the slit was at right angles to the direction of movement of the film. 
    A second lens focused the image of the slit onto the film, the width of the 
    resulting band of light being 0.00075 inch. The beam of light was then modulated 
    by the passing film and reached the photocell via an aperture in the film 
    guide and a semi-cylindrical lens at the back of the guide.<br clear="all" />
    <br />
    The output of the photocell was very small so a single valve pre-amplifier 
    was built into the machine. The valve was mounted immediately behind the photocell, 
    the remaining components were situated in the exciter lamp housing. The repro 
    amplifier itself had a response which rose by about 10dB from 1kHz to 8kHz 
    and was bay mounted. It was possible to playback during the recording process, 
    thus allowing a check to be made on the quality. <br clear="all" />

    These pictures show a surviving spool of film, photos from Neil Wilson of 
    the Washford Radio Museum. Clearly a test film it is labelled 'Standard frequency 
    run' and dated 27th June 1944. <br clear="all" />

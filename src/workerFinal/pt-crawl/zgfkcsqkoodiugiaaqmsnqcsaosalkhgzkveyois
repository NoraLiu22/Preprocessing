                of the most striking events in the Mesozoic Era was the rise to 
                dominance of dinosaurs in terrestrial ecosystems. The Mesozoic 
                lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three 
                periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with 
                a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction 
                and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the <a href="#TriassicPeriod">Triassic</a>, 
                <a href="#JurassicPeriod">Jurassic</a> and <a href="#CretaceousPeriod">Cretaceous</a> 
                Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular 
                lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The 
                dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the 
                gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated 
                the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, 
                appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, 
                the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints 
                that define modern life forms were in place, although<a href="../fossilpictures-wpd/Archaeopteryx/Archaeopteryx.htm"><img src="../fossilpictures-wpd/Archaeopteryx/Archaeopteryx-t.jpg" alt="Archaeopteryx bird fossil" width="188" height="126" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="right"></a>

                continent Laurasia and a southernmost continent Gondwana. Laurasia

                Permian-Triassic (P/T) Extinction Event marked the end of the 
                Permian Period of the Paleozoic Era, and the start of the Triassic 
                Period of the Mesozoic Era. The P/T extinction decimated the brachiopods, 
                corals, echinoderms, mollusks, and other invertebrates. The last 
                surviving trilobite Order, the Proetids, also did not survive. 
                The P/T <a href="../fossilpictures-wpd/Pteronodon/Pterosaur.htm"><img src="../fossilpictures-wpd/Pteronodon/Pteronodon-t.gif" alt="Pterosaur drawing" width="188" height="146" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="right"></a>event 
                set the stage for adaptative radiation in both land and marine

              <P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among 
                the enchinodermata, the inadunate crinoids, which had barely survived 
                the end-Permian extinction with one family, finally disappeared. 
                While crinoids were the most abundant group of echinoderms from 
                the early Ordovician to the late Paleozoic, they nearly went extinct 
                during the Permian-Triassic extinction. All the post-Paleozoic 
                crinoids, namely the Articulata, are presumed to be a monophyletic 
                clade that originated from the inadunate Order Cladida. However 
                there seems to be a great gap between the morphologies of articulates 
                and Paleozoic crinoids. Thus, a single genus of crinoid is known 
                from the early Triassic, and is ancestral to all &quot;deep water&quot; 
                extant articulate crinoids.</font></P>

                invertebrates, notably the bivalves, ammonoids and brachiopods 
                recovered to dominate the marine environment, and the squid-like 
                Belemites appeared and became abundant. New groups of echinoderms 
                appeared as well. Marine reptiles were highly diverse, including 
                the Sauropterygia, nothosaurs, pachypleurosaurs, placodonts, and 
                the first plesiosaurs. The ichthyosaurs appeared in the early 
                Triassic, and radiated into huge, marine-dominating species. Seed 
                plants dominated the land, especially conifers to the north and 
                the Glossopteris, or seed ferns, to the south. The first flowering 
                plants (the Angiosperms) probably evolved during the Triassic</font></P>
              <P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                Archosauromorph reptiles, and most notably the archosaurs, diapsid 
                reptiles that first appeared during the late Permian, inexorably 
                displaced the synapsids that had dominated the land during the 
                Permian. The plant-eating dinosaurs that appeared during the mid-to-late 
                Triassic were the first ornithischians, or bird-hipped dinosaurs, 
                and were not larger than turkeys. The early dinosaurs got bigger, 
                faster and more ferocious, and preyed on and eventually eliminated 
                many of the larger reptiles so that only the smallest survived. 
                The first flying vertebrates, the pterosaurs appeared in the Triassic. 
                The most primitive mammals probably appeared in the late Triassic, 
                descending from a mammal-like suborder of theraspid reptiles known 
                as cynodonts.</font></P>
              <P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                Triassic period closed with an extinction event that particularly 
                affected marine life, including decimation of marine reptiles, 
                except the surviving ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. A quarter of 
                invertebrate families met extinction, as well as the conodonts. 
                Actually, many extinction events punctuated the Triassic, which 
                are believed to have provided additional selective pressures fostering 
                the dinosaur radiation into emptied niches. Triassic land was 
                predominately the supercontinent Pangea (meaning all the land) 
                located near the equator. Sediments from the Triassic in the deeper 
                ocean have been mainly subsumed by subduction of oceanic plates, 
                leaving but a sparse marine fossil record. Dinosaurs would thus 
                go on to be increasingly diverse and dominating in the subsequent 
                Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The stereospondyl labyrithodont 
                amphibians, a group that had been successful through the Triassic, 
                suddenly and dramatically disappeared. Among other tetrapods, 
                several reptilian orders also became extinct, including the protosaurs, 
                nothosaurs, and placodonts.</font></P>

                ambiguous criteria. Compared with other reptiles, the dinosaur 
                hind limbs are beneath the body. The pelvis extends vertically 
                so that the hip socket vertically carries the load, rather than 
                on lateral loading other reptiles. In recent years dinosaurs have 
                been viewed as transitional between ordinary reptiles (especially

                conifers, Bennettitales and cycads) and ferns are common providing 
                abundant food for the sauropods. Birds evolved during the late

<font size=-1><i>Contributed by:<br>
Deanna B. Marcum<br>
President, Council on Library and Information Resources</i></font></p>

<p>The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) is an independent, catalytic organization that concerns itself with the well being of libraries and archives. One of its greatest assets is its flexibility to respond as circumstances change and new issues arise. The CLIR Board designated six themes for the agenda for the coming year: preservation awareness, digital libraries, leadership, economics of information, resources for scholarship, and international developments.</p>

<p><b>Preservation Awareness</b></p>

<p>CLIR has an ongoing commitment to the preservation efforts of libraries and archives throughout the United States and abroad. Presently, the need for national leadership in preservation is increasing as research libraries and archives deal with a greater number of items added to collections every year and recorded on increasingly unstable media. Through the preservation awareness area of interest, CLIR will advance its preservation agenda by supporting the preservation profession and library and archives managers responsible for preservation of collections. We shall continue to work collaboratively with library consortia and national institutions to advocate the use of tried-and-true preservation measures. Preservation and training will remain important components of the international agenda.</p>

<p><b>Digital Libraries</b></p>

<p>CLIR is committed to fostering the development of digital libraries as a resource for research and learning today and into the future. We are particularly interested in helping policy makers, funders, and academic leaders understand the nature of the social and institutional investments in digital libraries that are necessary to organize, maintain, and provide access to the growing body of digital materials for scholarly purposes. However, the development of digital libraries is proving to be a complex process, requiring much intensive and detailed work. At present, we seek to help accomplish this work and advance our interest in digital libraries primarily by serving as administrative home for the Digital Library Federation (DLF).</p>

<p><b>Resources for Scholarship</b></p>

<p>Concern with access to resources for scholarship grows naturally from CLIR’s preservation and access agenda. By defining access to research collections as an independent focus of activities, we address the critical functions of acquisition, description, and preservation in an integrated way that is a service to scholarship. It signifies our greater engagement with scholars in developing strategies for the growth and management of information resources.</p>

<p><b>Economics of Information</b></p>

<p>There are potential economic dimensions to all of CLIR’s projects and programs. Specific projects are still under development, but they will focus on the need for more analysis in the following areas:</p>
<p><ul>
<li> how to measure the productivity of information resources</li>
<li>how to assess the value of library and archival collections as heritage assets</li>
<li> how to help provosts and other university administrators measure the costs of information</li>
<li> how to develop business models for new services that grow out of CLIR’s activities</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Leadership</b></p>

<p>CLIR continues to give high priority to the development of leadership for cultural and educational institutions. Library directors, provosts, and presidents have identified leadership as one of the most urgent needs.</p>  

<p>In collaboration with Emory University, EDUCAUSE, and other library organizations, CLIR is developing a leadership institute that will bring together in a summer program potential leaders from libraries, computing centers, university  presses, and faculty ranks -- those who will manage the information resources of the campus in the future.</p>

<p><b>International Developments</b></p>

<p>The need for international partnerships and alliances is apparent in all of CLIR’s areas of interest. Preservation and access international projects have been well developed over the past ten years, but it is now time to broaden the international agenda to include digital libraries and resources for scholarship as obvious areas for international cooperation.</p>

<p><h3><font color="#000066">Copyright Ownership Issues and Higher Education Policies</font></h3>
<font size=-1><i>Contributed by:<br>

University of Maryland</i></font></p>

<p>One of the most complex tasks in establishing a digital library is working through the quagmire of legal and policy issues associated with copyright.  The legal issues associated with acceptable use of scholarly materials (which include determinations of whether or not an item is in the "public domain", ability to secure permission or license use, or decisions to exercise a statutory exception such as "fair use") are complicated enough by themselves.  However, the recipe can become indigestible to some once you add into the mix questions and controversies over who is the legal owner to the copyright.</p>

<p>According to copyright law, the set of exclusive rights (right to copy or reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, public performance or display) are the property of the "author."  The "author" is typically an individual, although it may include multiple individuals in the case of a joint work; however, the "author" can also be an employer if the copyrighted materials are developed "within the scope of employment" or the result of a "commissioned work."  The controversy over ownership of copyright is alive and well within the higher education community where tradition has led to a presumption (often reinforced through institutional policies) that scholarly materials developed by academics are owned by the individual scholar and not the employing institution.</p>

<p>There are several factors that fuel the current debate and efforts to establish new policies that give research universities greater control over the intellectual property developed by their faculty.  First, the digital revolution heightened by movements towards "distance education" is raising afresh questions of who owns the courses that are increasingly being delivered online.  Second, the interests of university administrations in maximizing the commercialization potential of university intellectual property -- a well-established process for patents developed by university faculty -- is extending its reach to copyrighted materials as well, especially computer software.  Finally, the practice of faculty relinquishing their copyrights to publishers in exchange for the credentials afforded by professional publication (necessary for tenure and promotion) is an emerging argument for reform, especially when the employing institution’s library must "buy back" the faculty member’s scholarly communication through increasingly expensive purchases or subscriptions.</p>

<p>There are many efforts afoot to provide resources and assistance to anyone who seeks to understand the issues and corresponding policy alternatives for establishing copyright ownership.  One such effort is a research project that is being conducted on behalf of the University of Maryland and the Association of Research Libraries (ARL).  The ongoing results of this research, including links to a number of university policies and associated resources, are available on a Web site called <strong>copyown<SUP>sm</SUP> :  A Resource on Copyright Ownership for the Higher Education Community</strong>, located at &lt;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.umd.edu/copyown">http://www.umd.edu/copyown</a>&nbsp;&gt;.  It is hoped that the information and discussions that result from this project, combined with on-campus dialogue and debate, will illuminate the issues and shed light on the solutions that are best suited to ensuring policies and practices that are thoughtful, flexible, and fair.</p>

Preservation management: keeping what we have
</font></h3><p>
<font size = -1><i>
Contributed by:<br>
Yola de Lusenet, Executive Secretary<br> 
European Commission on Preservation and Access<br>
Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences
</i></font></p>

<P>The aim of the conference "Preservation Management: between policy and practice" was to bring together librarians and archivists responsible for preservation in their institutions or involved in preservation projects.  The conference took place in The Hague (The  Netherlands) from 19 to 21 April, and attracted 140 participants from 25 countries from as far as Canada, the United States and New Zealand. The conference was hosted by the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, national library of the Netherlands, and was organized together with the IFLA Core Programme on Preservation and Conservation (IFLA-PAC) and the European Commission on Preservation and Access (ECPA).</P>

<P>In his keynote address Bendik Rugaas, national librarian of Norway, urged librarians and archivists to join forces and to engage in the political debate by presenting the case for preservation loud and clear. He stressed this implies a willingness to set priorities:  if professionals shirk away from painful decisions, they will only lose credibility with politicians.</P>

<P>Public relations, lobbying and the promotion of the cause for preservation were recurring themes. There was a shared feeling that if the outside world is not very receptive to the story preservation experts have to tell, other ways must be found to state the case more convincingly.</P>

<P>This was illustrative for the general atmosphere at the conference: constructive in the face of many uncertainties. In spite of a general lack of explicit national policies, of wide public support and of adequate funding, an impressive range of activities is being undertaken. Particularly striking was the current interest in mass deacidification as a viable option for selected materials. Susan Herion of the Swiss National Library, which is building a mass-deacidification plant together with the Swiss Federal Archives, spoke about managerial and organizational aspects (for background see: <a href="http://www.snl.ch/f/aktuell/index.htm">http://www.snl.ch/f/aktuell/index.htm</a> or <a href="http://www.snl.ch/d/aktuell/index.htm">http://www.snl.ch/d/aktuell/index.htm</a>). Ken Harris presented a paper on the Library of Congress experience; and mass deacidification companies dominated the small exhibition during the conference.</P>

<P>Most of the papers dealt with "conventional" materials and focused on managerial aspects: planning and organization, staff management, costs, etc. At the heart of this conference was this fairly mundane reality of thousands of books to be bound, of maps to be stored, of newspapers to be microfilmed, in short: of everything that is already there and needs to be taken care of. </p>

<p>There was surprisingly little talk about reformatting paper materials through digitization or about preservation of digitally born materials. One of the reasons may be that retrodigitization is as yet only an option for a select few: the usual candidates are materials in high demand, or attractive materials of great intrinsic value (e.g., illuminated manuscripts), which add up to only a fraction of the total holdings. No one seriously proposes the retrodigitization of all the books and documents in archives and libraries, many of which are consulted infrequently. Yet this constitutes the bulk of the materials preservation managers are dealing with on a daily basis.</P>

<P>The last afternoon, however, the digital future was central in a panel discussion on the "convergence of archives, libraries and museums", a concept promoted on the European as well as the national level. In this view, all "heritage institutions" are seen as sources of content to be brought together in digital repositories on the internet (see the EU site on digital heritage at <a href="http://www.echo.lu/digicult/en/backgr/brainsto.html">http://www.echo.lu/digicult/en/backgr/brainsto.html</a>).   In his opening address Rugaas had stated that in looking for support and funding, preservation managers should make creative use of every opening offered, even though the angle may seem unorthodox. In the current climate that means, paradoxically, going digital if your main concern is preservation of paper materials. The European Union (DG XII) will issue a Call for projects next September on digital preservation of cultural heritage -- a digitization call, but the 250-word preliminary text emphasizes "special attention given to surrogates of fragile physical objects" and also explicitly mentions "long-term accessibility" i.e., both preservation aspects of digitization. The challenge for preservation managers is to explore how such programmes can be turned to their advantage. 

<p>Similarly, one must address issues like "convergence" and "cross-sectoral cooperation" in the digital age in order to qualify as a serious partner. During the panel discussion, there was quite some agreement on shared aspects in library, archive, and museum work. Some elements are more important in one sector than in the others (e.g., number of visitors), and work in a specific area is not always on the same level in the three sectors (e.g., cataloguing/description). However, institutions within the same sector also differ considerably. The panel agreed that, in spite of real differences in culture, there are enough examples of successful cross-sectoral projects to inspire confidence for the future. The issue is not so much to which sectors the institutions concerned belong, but rather whether they can define common goals and shared interests.</P>

<P>The papers of the conference will be published by the ECPA in the course of this year; abstracts can be found at the ECPA website &lt;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.knaw.nl/ecpa">http://www.knaw.nl/ecpa</a>&nbsp;&gt;.</P>

         and Management of Cultural Heritage Materials</font></strong></H3>

<p align="center"><strong>Request for Proposals</strong></p>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.ninch.org/">National Initiative for a Networked
Cultural Heritage</A> (NINCH) is undertaking a project to review and
evaluate current practice in the digital networking of cultural
heritage resources in order to publish a<I> Guide to Good Practice in
the Digital Representation and Management of Cultural Heritage
Materials.</I> The Guide will be published in print and electronic
form.</P>

<P>A <A HREF="http://www.ninch.org/PROJECTS/practice/group2.html">NINCH Working Group on Best Practices</A>
has outlined the scope and purpose of the Guide. It will divide into
two sections: one on the capture and creation of digital cultural
heritage resources; the other on the management and maintenance of
that digital data. The Guide will encompass all genres. To encourage
broadest use of digital resources, the Guide will focus on
object-types (e.g., manuscripts, paintings, performance
documentations, etc.,) going beyond the limited perspectives of
institution types or disciplines (e.g., museums or history). The
primary audience will be institutions or researchers preparing to
create and manage digital cultural heritage resources with little
extensive knowledge of current technical and information standards,
metadata and best practices. Funders
will be an important secondary audience, for whom the Guide could
provide a set of key criteria for assessing the fundability of
digital projects.</P>

<P>The Working Group will proceed by commissioning a survey of the
field to discover and define exemplary practice. The survey will
include interviews with practitioners and reviews of published
guidelines and projects that demonstrate good practice; it should
also reveal areas for which good practice still needs to be developed
and documented. The Working Group will announce a call for
nominations of practitioners and projects to be considered by the
survey.</P>

<P>As a starting point, the Working Group has created an initial
definition of good practice consisting of six
<A HREF="http://www.ninch.org/PROJECTS/practice/principles2.html">principles</A> each of which  has a set of
<A HREF="http://www.ninch.org/PROJECTS/practice/criteria-2.html">evaluative criteria</A>, by which to judge
current practice. The Working Group has built into the process a
stage in which it may refine and extend these criteria as a result of
the survey. The survey is not intended to be a comprehensive review
of current practice; its purpose is to gather material, experiences
and opinions for the writing of the Guide.</P>

<P>The Working Group proposes to hire a consultant or consultants to
conduct the Survey and write the Guide in close consultation with the
Working Group. Those responding may address one or both parts of the
project: the Survey (Phase 1) and the Guide (Phase 2).</P>
 
The deadline for receipt of proposals is 5 pm (EST) <b>Monday June 21, 1999</b>.  Please see the full Request for Proposals at &lt;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ninch.org/PROJECTS/practice/rfprfp.html">http://www.ninch.org/PROJECTS/practice/rfprfp.html</a>&nbsp;&gt; for more details including the instructions for submission.

Given the international nature of academic publishing, and the fact that the professional literature suggested a higher incidence of activity within North America, the study was extended to encompass publishing
beyond the UK. This afforded a comparative context by which to view UK
initiatives. The project focused on publications used in tertiary education or for research, and electronic publishing was taken to mean texts made available in any computer-mediated format: diskette, CD-ROM or via the Internet." </p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from the Executive Summary of the <i>Report on Copyright and Digital Distance Education</i> and describes the contents of the report.

<blockquote><font size=-1>
<p>Over the past five years, the application of copyright law to distance education using digital technologies has become the subject of public debate and attention in the United States.  In the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA), Congress charged the Copyright Office with responsibility to study the issue and report back with recommendations within six months.  After an intensive process of identifying stakeholders, holding public hearings, soliciting comments, conducting research, and consulting with experts in various fields, the Office has issued this Report.</p>

<p>Part I of the Report gives an overview of the nature of distance education today.  Part II describes current licensing practices in digital distance education, including problems and future trends.  Part III describes the status of technologies relating to the delivery and protection of distance education materials.  Part IV analyzes the application of current copyright law to digital distance education activities.  Part V discusses prior initiatives addressing copyright and digital distance education. Part VI examines the question of whether the law should be changed, first summarizing the views of interested parties and then providing the Copyright Office's analysis and recommendations.</p></font></blockquote></p></li></p>

<p>The following quoted material is composed of excepts from the Executive Summary of <i>Strategies for Digital Data, Findings and recommendations from Digital Data in Archaeology: A Survey of User Needs</i>.  Please see the entire Executive Summary and the Table of Contents for a more complete  description of the project at the report web site  &lt;&nbsp;<a href="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/project/strategies/index.html">http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/project/strategies/index.html</a>&nbsp;&gt;.<p>
<font size=-1>

<P>"In the spring and summer of 1998 the Archaeology Data Service carried out a survey of the creation, archiving, use and re-use of digital data in archaeology.  Frances Condron undertook the survey, analyses and initial draft of <i>Strategies for Digital Data</i>. Julian Richards, Damian Robinson and Alicia Wise edited the work and brought it to publication. Three thousand questionnaires were mailed to archaeologists in Britain and Ireland. This was followed by a lesser number of structured telephone interviews conducted in July 1998. The results of this survey are presented in this report.

<p>
"Significant findings of the survey and issues that may be central to any national policy in digital data are:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<p><li>The HEI sector has the most privileged access to computers and the Internet. Areas with limited provision are independent/amateur archaeologists, contracting field units, museums and consultants.</li></li></p>

<p><li>Archaeologists in all areas are using computers in their work, and digital datasets hold important information. There is a growing body of information being created solely in digital format.</li></p>

<p><li>Many types of organisations hold digital datasets for the long term (not just museums). Most datasets are not secure, due to limited or poor archiving strategies.</p>

<p><li>Secure, long-term archives are needed for digital datasets.</li></p>

<p><li>In general, archaeologists want access to information irrespective of the medium in which it is contained. There is strong support for obtaining information on paper and digitally (tabulated datasets are particularly wanted digitally), though very little support for the use of microfiche.</li></p>

<p><li>Accessible, computerised, on-line linked indices of project archives are needed for archaeology to facilitate research, education, planning and policy.</li></p>

<p><li>Strategies are needed to identify which datasets should receive the highest priority for preservation. This needs to be determined by the information needs of archaeologists, and also in response to those projects that are in most danger of being lost.</li></p>

<p><li>Poor cataloguing/indices are a major barrier to increased use of archives. There is support for an up-to-date index of what
information resources are available.</li></p> 

 <p><li>Standards and guidelines are needed for the creation, archiving and dissemination of digital datasets.</li></p>

<p><li>A wide range of training is needed to help bring about effective creation, preservation and re-use of digital data."</li></p>
</ul></p></font>

<p> As the authors of the report point out, "Archaeology is not alone in facing these issues."</p></li></p>

<li><a href="http://heds.herts.ac.uk/">Higher Education Digitisation Service (HEDS)</a> makes available two feasibility studies.

<p>JISC Image Digitisation Initiative (JIDI) is digitising image content from 16 collections which have been selected for their significant scholarly importance. The main aim of JIDI is to create a substantial body of digitised content which, together with other JISC funded digital image libraries, will form the first step towards building a coherent digital image resource for Higher Education, contributing to JISC's Distributed National Electronic Resource (DNER).<p><A href="http://heds.herts.ac.uk/Guidance/JIDI_fs.html"><i>A Feasibility Study for the JISC Image Digitisation Initiative (JIDI)</i></a> details the background, method, technical baselines, findings and results, proposed production processes, procedures and potential costs of the project.
</p>

<P>The Report has relevance as a guidance document for anyone planning an image digitisation project. In particular, the attention paid to the preparation of material for digitisation and the workflow charts may be of help in project planning.</p>
<p>The JIDI report is available for download in PDF format at &lt;&nbsp;<a href="http://heds.herts.ac.uk/Guidance/JIDI_fs.pdf">http://heds.herts.ac.uk/Guidance/JIDI_fs.pdf</a>&nbsp;&gt;.</p>

<p>HEDS has also been commissioned to produce a Feasibility Study Report on the best method for converting various
paper media into electronic versions for the Refugee Studies Programme(RSP) Documentation Centre grey literature collection -- the largest dedicated to the subject in the world.

<p>The project has involved sampling at 600dpi and 400dpi in colour, greyscale and black and white, OCR testing and assistance in specifying the procedures and production processes for a significant pilot. This project is unique due to the high level of metrics gained by surveying over 800 documents (28,000 pages) and recording the details in a spreadsheet for statistical analysis. This has enabled very accurate estimation of costs; volume of pages to be digitised (potentially more than 700,000 pages) and suitable techniques.<p>

<p>A description of the resulting feasibility study, <i>A Feasibility Study for the Refugee Studies Programme Digital Library</i> may be found at &lt;&nbsp;<a href="http://heds.herts.ac.uk/Guidance/RSP_fs.html">http://heds.herts.ac.uk/Guidance/RSP_fs.html</a>&nbsp;&gt;.

<p>TORONTO, May 1999 --  Early Canadiana Online (ECO) is up and running.
This innovative project is moving Canada’s printed heritage on to the Internet at &lt;&nbsp;<A href="http://www.canadiana.org">http://www.canadiana.org</a>&nbsp;&gt;.</p>

<p>Now, viewers in Canada and around the world can experience online some
of the most significant people and events that have shaped the nation.</p>

<p>To date, the full text of  some 2600 books and pamphlets originally
published between the 16th and early 20th centuries have been scanned
and are now available on the Internet.  Subject areas include Canadian
literature, women’s history, travel and exploration, the history of
French Canada and native studies. By August, the ECO database will
comprise some 3200 titles, one third of which will be in French.</p>

<p>Early Canadiana Online is a collaborative project of the Canadian
Institute for Historical Microreproductions (CIHM), the National Library
of Canada, Laval University Library, Bibliothèque nationale du Québec,
and the University of Toronto Library.</p>

<p>The Library and Information Technology Association (LITA), a division of the American Library Association, has launched a new web site to identify trends to watch in library technology.<p>

<p>In January 1999, a discussion group was assembled by LITA which included Karen Coyle, Walt Crawford, Pat Earnest, Clifford Lynch, Roy Tennant, Carol Tenopir, Joan Frye Williams, Tom Wilson, and Milton Wolf.  These experts stay informed about top trends by reading technology related publications, attending computer seminars/workshops, and networking with others in library and computer related fields.   To date, they have come up with a list of seven important trends to watch, and these are listed along with short descriptions.  In addition, further links to information about each of those identified trends are provided.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/sigir99/">ACM SIGIR'99 Post-Conference Workshop on Multimedia Indexing and Retrieval</a>, 15 - 19 August 1999, Berkeley, California, USA. <i>Call for participation.  Deadline for paper or statement of interest is 18 June 1999</i>.</p>
<p>
Last year's workshop on Multimedia Indexing and Retrieval was very successful, and since the field is advancing so rapidly, it was felt that an annual workshop would be worthwhile.
</P>
<P> 
The focus this year is on the required functionality, techniques, and evaluation criteria for multimedia information retrieval systems. The goal of multimedia IR systems is to handle general
queries such as "find outdoor pictures or video of Clinton and Gore discussing environmental issues". Answering such queries requires intelligent exploitation of both text/speech and visual content. Multimedia IR is a very broad area covering both infrastructure issues (e.g., efficient storage criteria, networking, client-server models) and
intelligent content analysis and retrieval.  For this one-day workshop, there will be three focus areas in the intelligent analysis and retrieval area. 

<p>
<ul>
<p><li><i>Focus 1</i> of the workshop is on integrating
information from various media sources in order to handle multimodal queries on large, diverse databases. </li></p> 

<p><li><i>Focus 2</i> deals with examples of research using content and organization of multimedia information into semantic classes. </li></p> 


<p><li><i>Focus 3</i> of the workshop is on evaluation techniques for multimedia retrieval.  </li></p></ul></p> 

<p>
Additionally,  there will be one session  discussing MPEG-7 standards and content. By the time of the workshop, the selection committee would have made their choices for standards.
</p>

The workshop will focus on the following specific topics:
<p>
<ul><font size=-1>
<p><li> Content analysis and retrieval from various media (text, images, video, audio).</li></p>

<p><li> Interaction of modalities (e.g., text, images) in indexing, retrieval.</li></p>
 
<p><li> Effective user interfaces (permitting query refinement etc.)</li></p>

<p><li> Evaluation methodologies for multimedia information. We have  found that researchers pay insufficient attention to it.</li></p>

<p><li> Techniques for relevance ranking.</li></p>

<p><li> Multimodal query formation/decomposition.</li></p>

<p><li>Logic formalisms for multimodal queries.</li></p>
 
<p><li> Indexing and retrieval from scanned documents - e.g., extracting text from images, word spotting - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and printed documents.</li></p>

<p><li>Testbeds for evaluating multimodal retrieval: it would be nice to have some resource sharing here since annotating these, and coming up with a good query set are difficult.</li></p></font>
</ul></p>

<p>

Two types of participation are expected:</p>
<p>
<ol><p><li>Those interested in making a
presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address given below.</li></p>

<p><li> Those interested in participating, but not
presenting papers, should submit a statement of interest.</li></p>
</ol></p>

<p>Both types of submissions are due on
Friday, June 18th. All the submissions should be sent to:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.nedcc.org">Preservation Options in a Digital World: To Film or to Scan</a>, 21 - 23 September 1999, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.</p>

<p>This workshop is funded in part by the National Endowment for Humanities and is hosted by the Nebraska State Historical Society.</p>

<p>Digital technologies will have a profound impact on the way institutions provide access to information.  But
will digitization also become a tool of the preservation community? NEDCC's reformatting workshop will address this question.</p>

<p>The workshop will explore two reformatting technologies: preservation microfilming and digital imaging.  The similarities and marked differences of the technologies will be compared and evaluated.  The faculty will discuss lessons learned from preservation microfilming projects that can be applied to digital imaging projects.</p>

<p>The workshop is designed to train project administrators in institutions to plan, implement, and manage reformatting projects. Instruction will focus on decision making skills.  Compliance with national standards and RLG guidelines for preservation microfilming will be emphasized and the "best
practice" for digital projects will be discussed.  It is not a technician training program.  The program teaches skills for:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> planning reformatting projects</li> 

<li>selecting and preparing materials</li> 

<li>microfilm technology</li> 

<li>introductory digital imaging technology</li> 

<li>inspection and quality control</li> 
 
<li>evaluating digital imaging for preservation</li></ul></p> 

<p>Registration Information: The cost of the workshop is $250.  Attendance is limited to 18 participants accepted on a first-come-first-served basis.  The number of applicants from
one institution will be limited.  The registration fee of $250 includes a copy of <i>Introduction to Imaging</i>, by Howard Besser & Jennifer Trant.

Digitisation of European Cultural Heritage</a>: Products - Principles - Techniques, 21 - 23 October 1999, Utrecht, The Netherlands.</p>
<p><b>Digitisation of European Cultural Heritage</b></p>     
<p><font size=-1><i>
Contributed by:<br>
 Anne Muller<br>
Assistant Executive Secretary ECPA</i></font></p>

<p>This Symposium is being organised by the Institute for Information Science (formerly Computer and Humanities) of Utrecht University and the Utrecht University Library.</p>

<p>During the last decade, successful digitisation projects from
various European countries have provided access to a wealth of
historical and cultural sources in electronic form. These
projects show a number of different approaches, some of which
represent well-known standard solutions, while others may be
innovative or obscure. To explore this variety is one aim of this
symposium. Nevertheless, the assumption is that these projects
have a number of underlying principles in common, which together
define a "European" approach to digitisation that differs from
the "Anglo-Saxon" approach practised in the United States, Canada
and Great Britain.</p>

<p>Methodological themes are investigated in a series of plenary
papers to be read by Jörgen van den Berg, Andrea Bozzi, Pedro
Gonzalez, Anne R. Kenney, Frank Klaproth, Adolf Knoll, Dominique
Maillet, Michael Pidd, Bas Savenije, and Abby Smith. A number of
projects will be discussed separately in small-group sessions
with opportunities for discussion and hands-on experience. Among
these projects are the ESAC Folksong Corpus, Thesaurus Musicarum
Italicarum, World of Peter Stuyvesant, Illuminated Manuscripts of
the Dutch Royal Library, and the Norwegian Digital Radio Archive.
Many other projects will be informally demonstrated.</p>

<p>The symposium will be held at the Jaarbeurs in Utrecht, The
Netherlands. The participation fee is DFL 750 or 340 Euro;
coffee, tea, three lunches, reception and the Conference Dinner
are included in the fee. Accommodation can be reserved through

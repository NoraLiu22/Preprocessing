			As a student I admired Casals from afar, mostly from recordings. The ground-breaking
			Dvor&aacute;k Concerto with Szell was a revelation, so was his conducting of Beethoven's
			Coriolanus Overture with the London Symphony. Later, on Sixth Avenue in New York,
			I would find his old scratchy thick Columbia l9l5 disks for 5o cents a piece. They
			displayed very impressive (by now faded) red-white-and-blue banners proclaiming the
			Grand Prizes won by the Columbia Phonograph Company in Milan, St. Louis, Paris, San
			Francisco and Buenos Aires, and had Pablo Casals' signature etched in the blank space
			near the center label of the disk. And the salon morsels they contained: Couperin-Kreisler
			Chanson Louis XIII &amp; Pavane, Goltermann Cantilena from his A minor Concerto,
			the Popper Mazurka and much more . . . .</FONT></TD>

		<TD WIDTH="500"><FONT SIZE="4">By the time I gave my first New York recital, Casals had settled in
			Puerto Rico. I had been so moved by his recordings of Mendelssohn's &quot;Spring
			Song&quot; and his &quot;Song without Words in D Major&quot; that I felt emboldened
			to send him a recording of the B Flat Sonata from my concert as a gesture of thanks
			and kinship. To my great surprise I received a reply in less than two weeks. It was
			warm and generous. Above all, Casals could not resist giving me a mini-lesson in
			writing. I shall treasure this simple letter always: . . . &quot;I liked very much
			the feeling which you put in the music, also your good <I>en</I> tonation.<BR>
			I would suggest, nevertheless, that you should try not to swell the notes. . . It
			was very nice of you to have sent this record .&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Many years later, long after his death, I had two occasions to be touched by Casals'
			legacy. My wife, violinist Shirley Givens, and I were invited to participate in the
			Puerto Rico Casals Festival (still continuing to this day). Our contribution was
			a trio and sonata concert with pianist Samuel P&eacute;rez held at the Puerto Rico
			Conservatory that Casals had founded. I was honored to play the Bach D Minor Suite.
			(See Violoncello Society Newsletter, Winter l990/91, </FONT><A HREF="sanjuan.html"><FONT
			SIZE="4">&quot;The Golden Treasure of San Juan&quot;,</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> in
			The Library - Reading Room.<BR>
			<BR>
			An even more emotional occasion was a chamber music concert in the salon of Casals'
			last home on the outskirts of San Juan before an invited audience of the island's
			musical &eacute;lite. I have described my feelings elsewhere (in another Violoncello
			Society Newsletter, Fall l993, </FONT><A HREF="casalspr.html"><FONT SIZE="4">&quot;Casals
			Lives On in Puerto Rico&quot;</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4">, in The Library - Reading
			Room). Suffice it to say here that the experience of performing the great Mozart
			E Flat Divertimento for String Trio while sitting in the great man's chair, in front
			of his very grand piano, with his features looking down from a portrait on the wall,
			was quite overwhelming! </FONT><BR>

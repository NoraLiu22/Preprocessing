/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mechanics' Institutions are societies which have 

          of late years been established in many towns in the kingdom, for the 

          purpose of applying the principle of combination in affording scientific 

          instruction to all persons, and especially to the working classes. They 

          are distinguished from Literary and Philosophical Societies, principally 

          by attempting to diffuse information on the various branches of practical 

          science, and more particularly on those which relate to the mechanical 

          and other arts; and though they may at times be made available for diffusing 

          a taste for the higher branches of science, general literature, and 

          the fine arts, yet their main object ought never to be lost sight of; 

          for when that is the case, the class for which they are principally 

          intended become less benefited. Keeping these principles in view, but 

          endeavouring to modify them, so as to suit the present case, we proceed 

          to the immediate matter of the Essay.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to discover how the funds of the society 
          may be most profitably disposed of to meet the end in view, it is necessary 
          to consider, first, what is most necessary for the well-being of the 
          institution; and, in the next place, what should be attended to as of 
          secondary importance. In a town like this, where of course persons of 
          every grade of intellect and variety of opinion are <font color="990000">[[p. 
          67]]</font> gathered together, it is necessary to awaken the attention 
          and satisfy the wants of all in a general point of view. This may be 
          done by a large supply of the best periodical publications, including 
          of course some London and country newspapers, and a few literary as 
          well as scientific magazines; but we would at the same time recommend 
          that, in accordance with the principles with which we commenced, the 
          main object should be constantly kept in view, and that, consequently, 
          not too much of the funds should be expended in general literature, 
          but that as great a variety of scientific publications as possible be 
          obtained. Perhaps it may here be objected that such works will not be 
          soon read, but lie uncut upon the table; probably for a time this may 
          be the case--but it is the society's duty, both to supply the materials 
          for diffusion of scientific and historical information,--and by subsequent 
          proceedings, which we shall point out, endeavour to create or increase 
          a taste for seeking it. A sufficient balance of funds each year should 
          always be left to purchase some standard works of science, biography 
          and history, for the formation of a permanent library of reference--which, 
          with the donations that may from time to time be received, will soon 
          become both valuable and exceedingly useful. This plan has already, 
          in a great measure, been adopted by the institution--and, with a few 
          alterations, seems all that can be desired. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There appears, however, to be a preponderance of 
          general news, over permanent and standard works. We would therefore 
          recommend that one at least of the five newspapers should be discontinued: 
          perhaps the Leeds Mercury, as being neither a London nor a Local paper; 
          also the Penny Magazine, and Magazine of Science, which are of almost 
          too trifling a nature;--and perhaps Tait's Magazine, one literary periodical 
          being sufficient. Instead of these, either the Athen&aelig;um (one of 
          our most valuable periodicals) ought to be taken, and the Annual Reports 
          of the British Association, or some other valuable literary journal 
          be obtained; or the whole of the sum thus gained may be annually devoted 
          to the formation of a permanent library--which, as we before mentioned, 
          should be made an express object, as it is of the greatest importance. 
          The Penny Cyclop&aelig;dia we trust will be made complete, for, with 
          the other volumes already obtained, it will form a good foundation for 
          a valuable library. Periodical publications, even the best and most 
          scientific, cannot be expected to do more than advert to general principles, 
          and describe improvements and extensions of science as they occur--but 
          they cannot treat fully upon any one subject, much less on the whole 
          range of human knowledge. By these alone, therefore, curiosity is excited, 
          but not satisfied, which state of feeling, if long continued, generally 
          leads to indifference or disgust. A library of good and valuable books 
          will obviate this, by giving each an opportunity of studying whatever 
          he may consider most interesting or useful. Among the works we consider 
          worthy of being first obtained by the society, are the Natural <font color="990000">[[p. 
          68]]</font> History and Natural Philosophy, Volumes of the Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia, 
          Loudon's Encyclop&aelig;dia of Agriculture, Plants, &amp;c., Lyell's 
          Geology, Murchison's Silurian System, Kirby and Spence's Entomology, 
          Lindley's Natural System of Botany, Brande's Chemistry, George Coombe's 
          Constitution of Man, and other works--Dr. Channing's works, Humboldt's 
          Personal Narrative, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials for diffusing information being thus 
          prepared by the institution, it becomes desirable to create a taste 
          for its acquirement, and to promote an interest in scientific and literary 
          pursuits. To do this, lectures are of great avail; and whenever persons 
          can be found willing to undertake the delivery, they should be immediately 
          requested to do so; and diagrams, or any other necessary apparatus, 
          should be prepared under the direction of the lecturer, at the expense 
          of the society, and kept for use at any future period. But besides this, 
          it is proper that some more regular and effectual means should be adopted 
          to promote the much-to-be-desired spirit of enquiry; this we conceive 
          may be best done in the following manner:--Every member residing in 
          or near the town, without exception, should take his turn on an appointed 
          evening in the week, to do one of the following things--either first 
          read a paper of his own composition on any scientific subject,--or secondly, 
          commence a discussion on any subject, or ask a question, or propose 
          a subject for discussion. Each person should put his name and the subject 
          in a book for the purpose, at least three days or a week previous; and 
          if such subject is suggested by any work in the institution, he should 
          state the volume and page, in order to give other members an opportunity 
          of preparing themselves. Should a member wish to bring any thing before 
          the society at any other time than in his regular turn, he may be permitted 
          to put his name and the subject in the book--and should there be no 
          time for it to be discussed after the regular business of the evening, 
          it might be adjourned to the next day. On all such occasions a chairman 
          should of course be appointed, to keep order and see that each speaker 
          expressed himself without interruption. A majority of the company present 
          should, at the conclusion, determine who had argued in the most convincing 
          and efficient manner; this would help to give to the members not only 
          a facility of argument, but also a capability of expressing themselves 
          so as to be readily understood by others: it would bring all in turn 
          to take an interest in some scientific subject, and might perhaps lead 
          them to make it their study;--it would excite enquiry and research, 
          and might perhaps draw out some sparks of hidden fire, which wanted 
          but the excitement of discussion to elicit. It would be thereby ascertained 
          how far the capabilities of the members were adapted for imparting instruction 
          to others, and those who in these discussions evinced a more than ordinary 
          knowledge of a particular subject might be requested to deliver a lecture 
          thereon; which would be the means of both making themselves more thoroughly 
          acquainted with it, and of giving to others <font color="990000">[[p. 
          69]]</font> the advantage of their researches: great good would result 
          from such meetings and such discussions; they would be of the greatest 
          importance in giving every one an opportunity of comparing his ideas 
          with the opinion of others--thus shewing him what is inaccurate, and 
          confirming whatever correct opinions he may have imbibed. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mechanics' Magazine, during the first years 

          of its existence, by giving insertion to the statement of every person 

          who fancied he had discovered the perpetual motion, has perhaps done 

          more to abolish, among young mechanics, fruitless search after that 

          philosopher's stone of modern times, than the most able arguments of 

          our men of science could accomplish. The correction of false ideas and 

          incorrect opinions on well-known principles of science are not among 

          the least benefits that would accrue from such a course as we have recommended.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many having imbibed a false opinion, and having 

          embraced it for a time, as a certain and undoubted fact, are, on seeing 

          it contradicted without a clear explanation, more apt to doubt the truth 

          of the principle they have misunderstood, than willing to acknowledge 

          that they have been so long in error. As the means of inciting to the 

          acquirement of knowledge on all subjects, of creating a wish for information 

          on what have been hitherto considered as abstruse branches of knowledge, 

          but which are frequently among the most interesting and generally useful,--and 

          of inspiring a desire for diving deeper into its inexhaustible stores 

          not yet exposed to the scrutinizing gaze of man, such an institution 

          as this, conducted in the way we have described, will be invaluable.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many of our great men, of whom as Britons we 
          may justly be proud, have arisen from comparative obscurity; but we 
          shall find that all who have become really great have had the desire, 
          and in some degree at least, the means of obtaining knowledge; and may 
          we not conclude that as knowledge and the means of acquiring it are 
          more generally diffused, increased numbers of men (who without such 
          means would have plodded on through life unknown) will burst forth and 
          shine in all the splendour of their talents, to keep up the honorable 
          name which England has obtained among the nations of the earth. All 
          have doubtless heard how the celebrated Dr. Herschell was, in his youth, 
          a musician in a foreign military band--but think you not that the love 
          of knowledge must have been most powerful in him whose name is now known 
          in every corner of the civilized world?--think you, that he who has 
          added the knowledge of worlds to our own system, and penetrated further 
          than the mind can conceive into the regions of space,--and whose intellect 
          enabled him, from every appearance of those innumerable worlds, to add 
          immensely to our knowledge of the structure of the mighty universe, 
          and point out the great changes which for millions of ages it has undergone, 
          could have done this without the desire and the means of acquiring <font color="990000">[[p. 
          70]]</font> information in his youth? Sir George Stephenson, lately 
          knighted by her Majesty, Queen Victoria, who may be said to be the father 
          of English railways, and whom many nations of Europe have sent for to 
          superintend similar structures abroad, was a poor minor, working in 
          the bowels of the earth for his daily bread; and without the desire 
          and the means of obtaining knowledge, would have been a minor still. 
          Dr. Simpson, who as a mathematician is universally known, was a Spitalfields 
          weaver, and first made his talent known at the Spitalfields Mathematical 
          Society, established by the weavers of those days, who were a very different 
          set of men from what they are at present. As a last, though by no means 
          the least eminent example that may be cited, the celebrated James Watt, 
          the benefactor not only of England but of the whole world, was a working 
          mathematical instrument maker; and it is said that a model of a steam-engine 
          sent to him to be repaired first induced him to turn his mind to the 
          improvement of that important machine: how well he succeeded all know;--but 
          he was not, as is too frequently supposed, an uneducated man; far from 
          it--he united in the highest degree practical and theoretical knowledge--was 
          an excellent mechanic, and a profound mathematician; had he not been 
          so, the steam-engine would not be as it is at present, one of the noblest 
          examples of the ingenuity of man. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many more instances might be adduced, if more were 

          necessary, to shew that great discoveries do not arise from the chance 

          thoughts of the uneducated, but from the laborious studies of the wisest 

          men; and is it not therefore the surest way to increase the number of 

          such men, who are an honor to our nature, to give information and knowledge 

          to all--to nourish every spark of genius that may appear, till it burst 

          into a flame that diffuses light and life on succeeding generations. 

          How know we that we have not a Herschell, a Stephenson, a Simpson, or 

          a Watt, within this town, who want but the means of acquiring that knowledge 

          which they might give back one hundred fold to the world.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is our duty then to disseminate all the information 

          in our power, and to use every means for exciting all, especially the 

          young, to the acquirement of knowledge--knowing that we shall thereby 

          promote their own happiness as well as benefit the community. In pointing 

          out the method by which we conceive the desirable end may be most practically, 

          easily, and advantageously accomplished, we have studied conciseness 

          rather than display, and have preferred the statement of practical means 

          rather than adverting solely to theoretical truths; and it will be our 

          greatest pleasure to find that the plan we have proposed should in such 

          a cause be thought worthy of adoption.</p>

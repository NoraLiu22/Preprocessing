					<h3 class="line">Howâ€™s Life?</h3>
					<p align="left">Mexico has made tremendous progress over the last decades in terms of improving the quality of life of its citizens. Notwithstanding, Mexico performs poorly in many dimensions of well-being relative to other countries in the Better Life Index. It underperforms average in income, jobs, education, health, environmental quality, social connections, safety and life satisfaction. These assessments are based on available selected data.</p>
<p align="left">Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards. In Mexico,<strong>&nbsp;the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD&nbsp;16 269 a year</strong>, less than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;30 490 a year.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of employment,&nbsp;<strong>about 59% of people aged 15 to 64 in Mexico have a paid job</strong>, below the OECD employment average of 66%. Some 76% of men are in paid work, compared with 45% of women.<strong>&nbsp;In Mexico, 27% of employees work very long hours in paid work</strong>, well above the OECD average of 10%, with 33% of men working very long hours in paid work compared with 17% of women.</p>
<p align="left">Good education and skills are important requisites for finding a job. In Mexico,&nbsp;<strong>42% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, much lower than the OECD average of 79%. However, completion varies between men and women, as 42% of men have successfully completed high school compared with 41% of women. In terms of the quality of the education system,<strong>&nbsp;the average student scored 416 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)</strong>. This score is lower than the OECD average of 488. <strong>Boys outperformed girls by 3 points in Mexico, </strong>compared to the OECD average where girls outperformed boys by 5 points.</p>
<p align="left">In terms of health,&nbsp;<strong>life expectancy at birth in Mexico is around 75 years</strong>, six years lower than the OECD average of 81 years. Life expectancy for women is 78 years, compared with 72 for men.&nbsp;<strong>The level of atmospheric PM2.5</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; tiny air pollutant particles small enough to enter and cause damage to the lungs &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>is 20.3 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, well above the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter. In Mexico, <strong>75% of people say they are satisfied with the quality of their water</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 84%.</p>
<p align="left">Concerning the public sphere, there is a moderate sense of community and moderate levels of civic participation in Mexico, where<strong>&nbsp;77% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need</strong>, less than the OECD average of 91%. <strong>Voter turnout,</strong>&nbsp;a measure of citizens' participation in the political process,&nbsp;<strong>was 63% during recent elections</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 69%..</p>
<p align="left">When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, Mexicans gave it&nbsp;<strong>a 6 grade on average,&nbsp;lower than the OECD average of 6.7.</strong></p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Living in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people's lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. All of these elements help make a house a home. And of course there is the question whether people can afford adequate housing.</p>
<p align="left">Housing costs take up a large share of the household budget and represent the largest single expenditure for many individuals and families, by the time you add up elements such as rent, gas, electricity, water, furniture or repairs. In Mexico, households on average spend&nbsp;<strong>18%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of their gross adjusted disposable income on keeping a roof over their heads</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 20%.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to housing costs it is also important to examine living conditions, such as the average number of rooms shared per person and whether households have access to basic facilities. The number of rooms in a dwelling, divided by the number of persons living there, indicates whether residents are living in crowded conditions. Overcrowded housing may have a negative impact on physical and mental health, relations with others and children's development. In addition, dense living conditions are often a sign of inadequate water and sewage supply. In Mexico,&nbsp;<strong>the average home contains 1.1 room per person</strong>, less than the OECD average of 1.7 rooms per person and one of the lowest rates in the OECD. In terms of basic facilities,&nbsp;<strong>74.1%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of dwellings in Mexico contain private access to an indoor flushing toilet</strong>, considerably less than the OECD average of 97%.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Smart urban planning</em></p>
<p align="left">Housing and urban policy reform is a priority under the current administration. The government wants to reduce the housing deficit that still affects around 35% of Mexican households and stop the inefficient development patterns of recent decades. Despite the country&rsquo;s rapid urbanisation, Mexico has until very recently lacked an urban policy to guide urban development. In the past, Mexican authorities have focussed on building houses, rather than building cities, and urban policy happened by accident through housing policy. But Mexico is now beginning to transition out of this type of policies.</p>
<p align="left">This new approach to housing and urban policy shifts from quantitative objectives for housing to a more explicit qualitative focus on housing and the urban environment. The objectives are made explicit in the National Housing Programme 2014-21, which aims to: i) provide decent housing for Mexicans, ii) address the housing gap, iii) transition toward a smarter, more sustainable urban development model and iv) improve inter-institutional co-ordination.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Renovating social housing</em></p>
<p align="left">The private company<em>&nbsp;Provive</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>T&uacute; y Yo</em>&nbsp;foundation work collaboratively to improve the physical and social conditions of Mexican neighbourhoods. Together they renovate abandoned social housing that is then resold to stimulate urban regeneration.&nbsp;<em>Provive</em>&nbsp;buys, repairs, and sells the homes, while&nbsp;<em>T&uacute; y Yo</em>&nbsp;works with the community to develop social cohesion. Provive supports these efforts to engage the community, with a contribution equivalent to 5% of the home sale value. By 2015, 2 000 homes were resold with neighbourhoods improved in Tijuana, Mexicali and Ciudad J&uacute;arez.</p>

<p align="left">While money may not buy happiness, it is an important means to achieving higher living standards and thus greater well-being. Higher economic wealth may also improve access to quality education, health care and housing.</p>
<p align="left">Household net adjusted disposable income is the amount of money that a household earns each year after taxes and transfers. It represents the money available to a household for spending on goods or services. In Mexico,&nbsp;<strong>the average household net adjusted disposable income per capita is 16 269,&nbsp;</strong>lower than the OECD average of USD&nbsp;30 490.</p>
<p align="left">Household net wealth is the total value of a household's financial and non-financial worth, such as money or shares held in bank accounts, the principal residence, other real estate properties, vehicles, valuables and other non-financial assets (e.g other consumer durables). In Mexico,&nbsp;<strong>the average household net wealth is&nbsp;considerably lower</strong>&nbsp;than the OECD average of USD 323 960.</p>

                <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Expanding social programmes</em></p>
<p align="left">Mexico has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty and inequality over the past fifteen years. Still, social indicators remain unfavourable by international comparison, and poverty increased once again during the recession. Approximately 18% of the population lives in extreme poverty, defined as living under the lowest national poverty line.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Oportunidades&nbsp;</em>(previously&nbsp;<em>Progresa</em>) is a well-targeted conditional cash transfer programme, which helps people living in extreme poverty improve their educational, health and nutritional conditions. Over time, coverage has increased and this successful programme has helped improve secondary school enrolment rates, particularly benefitting girls. By enabling more regular health visits, it has also entailed a decline of both child morbidity and maternal mortality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The programme currently reaches approximately 6 million households, or about a quarter of the total Mexican population. Assistance is provided to families based on their specific needs, including resources for family income and better nutrition; scholarships for children and adolescents; medical services packages; and nutrition complements.</p>

<p align="left">Unemployed persons are defined as those who are not currently working but are willing to do so and actively searching for work. Long-term unemployment can have a large negative effect on feelings of well-being and self-worth and result in a loss of skills, further reducing employability. In Mexico,&nbsp;<strong>the percentage of the labour force that has been unemployed for a year or longer is currently at less than 0.1%</strong>, much lower than the OECD average of 1.3% and one of the lowest in the OECD.</p>
<p align="left">The wages and other monetary benefits that come with employment are an important aspect of job quality.&nbsp;<strong>People in Mexico earn&nbsp;USD&nbsp;16 230&nbsp;per year on average</strong>, much less than the OECD average of USD 49 165 and the lowest in the OECD.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4">
                <p align="left">Another essential factor of employment quality is job security, in terms of expected loss of earnings when someone becomes unemployed. This includes how likely you are to lose your job, how long you are likely to remain unemployed and how much financial assistance you can expect from government. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets. In Mexico,&nbsp;<strong>workers face an expected 4% loss of earnings if they become unemployed</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 5.1%.</p>

<p align="left">Humans are social creatures. The frequency of our contact with others and the quality of our personal relationships are thus crucial determinants of our well-being.</p>
<p align="left">A strong social network, or community, can provide emotional support during both good and bad times as well as provide access to jobs, services and other material opportunities. In Mexico,&nbsp;<strong>77%&nbsp;of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in a time of need</strong>, among the lowest rates in the OECD, where the average is 91%. &nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">A well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. Mexicans can expect to go through&nbsp;<strong>15.4 years of education&nbsp;between the ages of 5 and 39</strong>, much less than the OECD average of 18 years and the lowest level in the OECD.</p>
<p align="left">Graduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Mexico,&nbsp;<strong>42%&nbsp;of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education</strong>, much lower than the OECD average of 79% and one of the lowest rates among OECD countries.</p>
<p align="left">But graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, as research shows that reading skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.</p>
<p align="left">The&nbsp;<strong>average student in Mexico scored 416 in reading literacy, maths and science</strong>, far below the OECD average of 488, and one of the lowest rates in the OECD.&nbsp;The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

                <h2><strong>Better Policies for Better Lives</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><em>Reforming education</em></p>
<p align="left">Mexico has implemented various reforms in recent years to improve educational attainment and outcomes. These reforms have prioritised a competence oriented curriculum, the professionalisation of educators, and made the evaluation and assessment system more transparent and accountable.</p>
<p align="left">Mexico has introduced mandatory full time education for all children aged 4-15 and is aiming for universal coverage by 2022. To support this transition Mexico has promoted a Full Time Schools Program, which should be fully implemented by 2018. The programme is expected to reach 40 000 schools and benefit approximately five million students.</p>
<p align="left">Although comparatively low for OECD countries, Mexico's educational attainment and outcomes have improved since 2000. Enrolment rates among 15-29 year-olds increased from 42% to 53% in 2012. Upper secondary graduation rates increased by 14 percentage points over the same period. Since 2003, PISA scores in mathematics have also improved among boys and girls by 30 and 26 points respectively.</p>

<p align="left">The quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being. Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people's lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions,&nbsp;<strong>the health impacts of urban air pollution&nbsp;continue to worsen</strong>, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.</p></div><!-- /span4 -->

                <p align="left">PM2.5&ndash; tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung &ndash; is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In Mexico,&nbsp;<strong>PM2.5 levels are 20.3 micrograms per cubic meter</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter and much higher than the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter set by the&nbsp;World Health Organization.</p>
<p align="left">Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In Mexico, only&nbsp;<strong>75% of people say they are satisfied with water quality</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 84%.</p>

<p align="left">Trust in government is essential for social cohesion and well-being. High voter turnout is a measure of citizens' participation in the political process.

<p align="left">Broader public engagement in the decision-making process is also important for holding the government to account and maintaining confidence in public institutions. The formal process for public engagement in developing laws and regulations is one way to measure the extent to which people can become involved in government decisions on key issues that affect their lives. In Mexico, the level of stakeholder engagement in developing regulations is 3.2 (on a scale between 0 and 4), the highest level in the OECD, where the average is 2.1.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Improving services for taxpayers</em></p>
<p align="left">The Mexican government asked citizens to give them ideas on how to improve its mobile application services for taxpayers. The Revenue Service opened the design of its mobile application and managed a public contest, in partnership with a local NGO.</p>
<p align="left">The main goal was to enable citizens to do their tax transactions "anytime, anywhere, on any device." In one week, more than 100 participants signed up and 25 proposals were submitted. Of these, 11 finalists were selected to present their projects on stage in front of a distinguished panel of judges at the Entrepreneur Week; the public event ran by the Ministry of Economy. The winning proposal was supported by the Revenue Service for full development and implementation.</p>

            <div class="span4"><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<p align="left">Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In particular, Mexico has seen dramatic improvements in life expectancy (of more than 17 years) and a steady decline in infant mortality rates. Nonetheless, at just above&nbsp;<strong>75 years life expectancy, Mexico falls&nbsp;</strong>six years below the OECD average of 81 years, and shows the lowest life expectancy in the OECD. Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher health care spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors).&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">When asked "How is your health in general?" almost&nbsp;<strong>66% of people in Mexico reported to be in good health</strong>, less than the OECD average of 68%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, answers have been found to be a good predictor of people's future health care use.

<p align="left"><em>Results-based financing to increase coverage</em></p>
<p align="left">Mexico introduced public health insurance (<em>Seguro Popular</em>) in 2002, which has contributed to universal financial risk protection. However, effective coverage is low for chronic diseases, with only 26% of adult men and 30% of adult women having access to preventive care. To address this challenge, the state of Hidalgo&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Seguro Popular</em>&nbsp;designed a results-based financial incentive scheme in 2014 to improve performance of key service outputs and health outcomes.</p>
<p align="left">With the results-based financing, providers receive an annual bonus or deduction on expected&nbsp;<em>Seguro Popular</em>&nbsp;subsidies based on their performance in 20 primary care and 5 hospital care indicators, including: diabetes, cardiovascular health, prenatal care, breast cancer screening and the reduction of preventable surgery and hospital readmissions, among others. Indicators were designed based on the best evidence of likely health impact, on the feasibility of implementing the scheme and provider performance monitoring. Annual performance targets were defined using an expert panel to assess the provider&rsquo;s capacity to increase performance based on their degree of control over resources and outcomes. The size of the incentive fund was estimated at 10% of the payer&rsquo;s budget. The monitoring system was designed to make use of existing information and information systems in accessible formats.</p>

Evidence suggests that long work hours may impair personal health, jeopardise safety and increase stress.

                <p align="left">The more people work, the less time they have to spend on other activities, such as time with others, leisure activities, eating or sleeping. The amount and quality of leisure time is important for people's overall well-being, and can bring additional physical and mental health benefits.&nbsp;<strong>In Mexico, full-time workers&nbsp;devote less of their day on average to personal care</strong>&nbsp;(eating, sleeping, etc.)&nbsp;<strong>and leisure</strong>&nbsp;(socialising with friends and family, hobbies, games, computer and television use, etc.) than the OECD average of 15 hours.&nbsp;</p>

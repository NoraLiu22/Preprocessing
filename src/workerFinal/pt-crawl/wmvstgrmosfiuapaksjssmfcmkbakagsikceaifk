<IMG SRC="indent.gif" HEIGHT="1" WIDTH="45"><TT>The operation of the storage batteries is taken
up first, because the equipment will not
function successfully unless the batteries are
properly handled.<BR>
<BR>
</TT>

<IMG SRC="indent.gif" HEIGHT="1" WIDTH="45"><TT>In systems using the 1-FD type battery charging
panel (Fig. 8), one set of storage batteries,
called the H batteries, is used to supply
magnetizing current to the receivers attached
to the horns, and two other sets, F1 and F2,
supply filament current for the amplifiers,
exciting lamps, and indicating lights. The Fl
and F2 sets are used alternately, one set being
on charge while the other is supplying current.
It is very important to always follow this
practice, which is necessary in order to
maintain the charge and ensure that adequate
power will be available for every show.<BR>

<IMG SRC="indent.gif" HEIGHT="1" WIDTH="45"><TT>In systems using the 4-0 type battery charging
panel (Fig. 9), there are two sets of batteries,
#1 and #2, supplying current for the horns,
amplifier filaments, exciting lamps, and
indicating lights. These two sets are used
alternately, one set being on charge while the
other is supplying current. It is very
important to always follow this practice, which
is necessary in order to maintain the charge
and ensure that adequate power will be
available for every show.</TT><BR>
<BR>

<IMG SRC="indent.gif" HEIGHT="1" WIDTH="45"><TT>How long to run each set of batteries before
putting it on charge will depend on the extent
to which the equipment is used; furthermore, in
the case of the 1-FD battery panel, the
charging period may be different for the F sets as compared
with the H set. This makes it impossible to lay
down any general rule as to how long each set
should run. <U>It is therefore essential to use
the hydrometer supplied with the batteries, to
find out when each set needs charging</U>, as
explained below.</TT><BR>
<BR>



<IMG SRC="indent.gif" HEIGHT="1" WIDTH="45"><TT>The charger is set by our engineer to give the
proper charging rate, and this setting must not
be changed except on his instructions. The
charging switch of the AC charger may be kept
on all the time, as the charger circuit is
opened and closed by the switches on the
battery panel.</TT><BR>
<BR>

<IMG SRC="indent.gif" HEIGHT="1" WIDTH="45"><TT>The meters mounted on the panel are primarily
for use by our engineer in adjusting the
charging rate, and ordinarily the projectionist
does not need to read them. <BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="indent.gif" HEIGHT="1" WIDTH="45"><TT>As a storage battery becomes discharged and
loses its energy, there is a corresponding fall
in the specific gravity of the acid - that is,
the weight of the acid in comparison with the
weight of an equal volume of pure distilled
water. Knowing this figure for any battery, it
is possible to tell at once whether or not it
needs recharging. The hydrometer is an
instrument for ascertaining the specific
gravity of the acid in a batteryusually called
for short the "battery gravity".</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR>

  <div class="post-content">
        <p>Some aspects of radio history are open to debate, and may
    always be&mdash;was KDKA really the first station, or was it WWJ,
    or perhaps even my favourite, 1XE/WGI? But in the matter of early
    FM, this much is generally agreed upon: we owe its development in
    New England to two men&mdash;the inventor Edwin Howard Armstrong,
    and the business executive who believed in and supported his
    work&mdash;<a href="shepard">John Shepard 3rd</a>.  When
    Armstrong's former friend and colleague David Sarnoff turned away
    from a commitment to FM, it was Shepard who offered encouragement.
    Always quick to spot a trend, Shepard believed that FM could be
    beneficial and profitable; many station owners were threatened by
    FM, fearing it would hurt their AM operations, but Shepard had no
    hesitation in befriending Armstrong and investing in FM.  Shepard
    put the power and prestige of the Yankee Network at Armstrong's
    disposal and planned to bring FM broadcasting to greater
    Boston.</p>

    <p>In the spring of 1937, Shepard applied for a permit for a 50-kW
    FM station in Paxton.  In an article he wrote for <cite>FM
    Magazine</cite> in March of 1941, Yankee Engineering Vice
    President Paul DeMars recalled that the plan was initially beset
    with problems: &ldquo;Delays in obtaining a suitable site... held
    up construction for over a year, but in October of 1938, work was
    begun... When this project was planned, no 50-kW equipment had
    been built for the frequencies assigned to FM experimentation.
    Furthermore, no antenna system had been designed or constructed
    with radiating efficiency high enough to insure the desired
    performance.&rdquo; Undaunted, the construction team built a road
    through what had been woods and pastures, to the top of
    Asnebumskit Hill, and embarked on erecting what would become
    W1XOJ, the first FM station in Massachusetts.  As DeMars mentioned
    in his article, since 50-kW transmitters for FM were still being
    perfected, the new station did not go on with full power&mdash;its
    first broadcasts were at about 2 kW.  (The Paxton site is still
    used for FM broadcasts, by an indirect descendant of that station,
    now WAAF.  When the Worcester <cite>Telegram &amp; Gazette</cite>
    decided to build their own FM station, W1XTG, they chose adjacent
    Little Asnebumskit Hill; that station is now WSRS and is still in
    the original location.)</p>

    <p>The Boston media tried to explain what was going on, since the
    average person might be confused by so many new developments.  The
    Boston <cite>Post</cite> noted in a May, 1939 article that within
    weeks, New England would hear &ldquo;a radically new and different
    broadcasting service that may prove to be revolutionary... the new
    system not only requires a new type of transmitter but it also
    requires a new type of radio receiver.  Transmission will not be
    in the regular broadcast band but on ultra high-frequency, 43
    megacycles or seven metres approximately.&rdquo; The Post informed
    its readers that W1XOJ would have its transmitter &ldquo;on top of
    a hill whose summit is 1375 feet above sea level.  The antenna
    mast is 400 feet high and supports a special array called a
    &lsquo;turnstile&rdquo;.  The purpose of this array is to direct
    the radiation toward the horizon and to suppress skyward
    radiation&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, buried in the glowing reports of
    the near completion of the Paxton site was the news that the
    Yankee Network programming Shepard wanted to broadcast from Boston
    was not able to reach Paxton; thus, a relay station (called at
    first W1XOK, then WEOD) was built; it had 250 Watts, and was
    located at the Yankee Network studios on Brookline Avenue.</p>

    <p>What the Boston media did not mention was that WBZ was not
    amused.  Westinghouse and Shepard had long been in competition for
    advertising dollars.  Now, the Westinghouse engineers felt they
    were being upstaged by Shepard's ability to get his name (and the
    names of all his engineers) in print as innovators in FM.  I have
    copies of several letters sent back and forth between WBZ's chief
    engineer and Shepard's, with claims and counter-claims.  WBZ
    wanted to enter into the FM area too, but clearly, Shepard was
    scoring a major publicity coup, and the Boston newspapers were
    giving him lots of ink. (In fairness, it should be pointed out
    that for a time during the early 1930's, during the
    &lsquo;Press-Radio War&rsquo;, the print media had been Shepard's
    bitter enemies; but the sudden arrival of a new and exciting
    technology plus the fact that Shepard was instant copy, always
    ready with an event or a quote, made even former rivals follow him
    around to see what FM could really do.)</p>

    <p>Prior to W1XOJ's first broadcast, Shepard&mdash;in conjunction
    with the Institute of Radio Engineers&mdash;scheduled a
    demonstration of FM, to which he invited his competitors from
    other stations.  The demonstration, which took place on May 26,
    1939 at Northeastern University, was also attended by several
    hundred college professors, engineers, scientists, and
    technicians, as well as one very annoyed chief engineer from WBZ.
    In a letter to the home office several days after, WBZ Plant
    Manager Dwight Myer called the event basically a waste of time and
    claimed to be totally unimpressed.  He closed his letter with
    these comments: &ldquo;It is not frequency modulation itself that
    I am belittling but the meeting.  The talks were non-technical,
    and in my opinion, it was engineered as a mutual publicity stunt
    for John Shepard and Major Armstrong.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Publicity stunt or not, the Boston media expressed great
    enthusiasm.  The <cite>Post</cite> that Sunday headlined
    &ldquo;Engineers Hail Noiseless Radio&rdquo; and went on to
    describe how the audience listened with amazement to a variety of
    source material, all of which came through with incredible
    clarity.  In the talk which Armstrong gave before the
    demonstration, he did in fact thank Shepard for his support, but
    he also explained that it had been Paul DeMars who had first come
    to believe in FM and who then persuaded Shepard to become
    involved.</p>

    <p>On July 24, 1939, W1XOJ began a schedule of 16 hours a day on
    the air (8 AM to midnight).  The power was soon boosted to 30 kW,
    but then in mid-January of 1940, a violent ice storm did serious
    damage to the transmitting antenna, and a temporary antenna was
    called into service.  It would take another year before Shepard's
    dream of a 50-kW FM became a reality, on January 15, 1941.  But
    Shepard had another dream too&mdash;an FM network for New England.
    There was a 500-watt Weather Service station (W1XOY) atop
    Mt. Washington in New Hampshire, and he hoped to convert it into
    his second FM.  Broadcasting the Yankee Network programs just as
    W1XOJ did, this new station would be capable of reaching a very
    underserved area of Northern New England, an audience he estimated
    at nearly a million people.</p>

    <p>And so it was, on December 18, 1940, that the next link in
    Shepard's plan went on the air&mdash;it was now known as W1XER
    (shown), and while it was supposed to eventually be 5 kW, it went
    on the air with 1 kW. The engineering staff had been challenged by
    the severity of Mt. Washington weather, and Paul DeMars stated in
    another article for <cite>FM Magazine</cite> that at times he
    wondered if the team would be able to overcome the inhospitable
    atmosphere on the mountain: gale-force winds and monumental snow
    drifts made working especially difficult.  He worried most about
    the new antenna&mdash;if one more antenna were to blow down, it
    would be a financial disaster for the Yankee Network.  The new
    equipment for Paxton had cost $35,000, and converting the
    Mt. Washington station to FM cost more than $50,000; in 1939-40,
    these were not small sums.</p>

    <p>The brutally cold temperatures and frequent high winds the
    engineers encountered while building W1XER delayed the project,
    such that it took three years to complete.  At times, the
    engineers were stranded at the site, with only the provisions they
    had brought with them, until the bad weather diminished.  One
    wonders if Shepard had realised that the new station would be so
    difficult for his engineers to build. They persevered, and their
    efforts finally paid off&mdash;but it was not exactly a camping
    trip.  DeMars recalled, &ldquo;During the last two months of the
    construction and testing period at W1XER, it was necessary for the
    Yankee engineers... to either ski or walk the eight miles of
    mountain road to the Summit, because snow made the road impassible
    even to a tractor.  Some of the equipment was taken half way up
    the mountain by ski-mobile... It was back-packed by men the
    remainder of the way...&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As for John Shepard, he was busy selling&mdash;selling
    potential advertisers on the possibilities of FM.  (On May 26,
    1941, the first commercials exclusively for FM were broadcast over
    both stations&mdash;by now, these stations were known as W43B and
    W39B.  The commercials that ran were bought by the Socony-Vacuum
    Oil Company, today's Mobil.)  He was also selling the FCC on
    permitting commercial FM broadcasts, and doing what he could to
    persuade them to allocate more and better FM frequencies.  He was
    a tireless advocate for the new technology, and was quoted often
    in publications such as the <cite>New York Times</cite>,
    <cite>Broadcasting</cite>, and <cite>Variety</cite>, as well as
    the Boston newspapers.  He mobilised other station owners to see
    FM's potential, and without neglecting his AM operation&mdash;he
    simply expanded it, using FM to get the Yankee Network out to an
    even larger audience.  When in March of 1942 he opened a new
    studio complex in Boston, he proudly showed the media an
    impressive display of state of the art equipment in the six new
    studios, several of which were exclusively for FM broadcasts.</p>

    <p>It is difficult to say whether FM would have blossomed had not
    World War II intervened.  Armstrong was preoccupied with the war
    effort, and many of the people involved in research were drafted.
    But Shepard continued to broadcast FM and continued to persuade
    other owners to give it a try.  While today we take FM for
    granted, it is interesting to recall that not so long ago, the
    jury was still out: people agreed that the sound quality was
    wonderful, but few realised that one day FM would become dominant
    and AM would recede in importance. We who live in New England are
    fortunate that we were on the cutting edge as FM grew; and no
    discussion of those formative years is complete without giving
    credit to John Shepard 3rd for his vision (and to his dedicated
    staff of engineers for their persistence in the face of
    overwhelming odds).  While his detractors called him a publicity
    hound and criticised how aggressively he pursued what he wanted,
    it cannot be denied that in FM as in many other aspects of
    broadcasting, John Shepard was truly a man ahead of his time.</p>

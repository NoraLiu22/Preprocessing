  <blockquote>  <!--sino date 1 January 2002-->

the full ideal of Federal Government ... in its highest and most elaborate
development, is the most finished and the most artificial
production of
political ingenuity. It is hardly possible that federal government can attain
its perfect form except in a highly refined
age, and among a people whose
political education has already stretched over many
generations.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Inglis
Clark was quoting Edward Augustus Freeman, Regius Professor of Modern History at
Oxford University, whose <i>History of Federal Government in Greece and Italy,
</i>first published in 1863, was the 'classic nineteenth century exposition' of
the city-state leagues of ancient Greece, and is still
cited today by
specialists in the field.<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Freeman, who succeeded William Stubbs to the Regius Chair, profoundly shaped
nineteenth century conceptions of federalism, although
studies of Australian
federalism have tended to neglect his
influence.<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup> While Freeman's
reputation suffered in later years, his earlier career was celebrated and
revered.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup> Thus Inglis Clark spoke
for many of the framers of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> when he described
Freeman as the 'eminent historian' who had 'studied the most closely, and
written the most exhaustively on federal
government'.<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup> Many other leading
framers, such as John Quick and Robert Garran, relied on Freeman extensively, as
did Richard Baker and Thomas
Just.<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup>
In one of their characteristic exchanges, Edmund Barton and Isaac Isaacs traded
scholarship derived from Freeman's <i>Growth of the English
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup> A survey of
citations in the Federal Convention Debates of the 1890s suggests that on issues
of federalism Freeman was second in
importance only to James
Bryce.<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup> Edward Freeman is one of the
forgotten doctors of Australian federalism. </p>
<p>So, where did the Australians derive their understandings about federalism,
and how did they assimilate these ideas for their own
purposes when drafting the
<i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>? In answer to the first question, much attention
has rightly been given to James Bryce's classic <i>The American
Commonwealth</i>, and in answer to the second question, attention has correctly
been given, for instance, to John Quick and Robert Garran's magisterial
<i>Annotated <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of the Australian Commonwealth</i> and William
Harrison Moore's <i>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of the Commonwealth of
Australia</i>.<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup> However, Bryce was
not the only source of federal ideas, and Moore, Quick and Garran were not his
only Australian interpreters.<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup> In
a separate paper, I have sought to draw attention to the range of authors and
sources that influenced Australian conceptions of
federalism.<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a></sup> In this article, I
seek to explain how works such as these were interpreted by the Australians and
adapted to their own purposes.</p>
<p>This article therefore begins in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part I</a> with a survey and summary of the key
sources on which the Australians relied. It then turns in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> to a number of
leading Australian writings with a view to explaining how federalism had come to
be understood in Australia at the
end of the nineteenth century. A number of
works that were written specifically for the edification of delegates to the
federal conventions
are closely examined, as well as a range of other important
Australian publications. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part III</a> concludes with some remarks about the
different perspectives about the idea of a 'federal commonwealth' that shaped
the positions
taken and arguments advanced by the framers of the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. It is hoped that this article will thereby illuminate our
understanding of the convention debates and of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> that
emerged from that process. </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading24"></a><b>I	DOCTORS OF AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION</b></h2>
<p>When towards the end of the nineteenth century Australians seriously
addressed their minds to the problem of constructing a 'nation
for a continent',
there could be little doubt that a union of the several colonies would be
specifically <i>federal</i> in form. The reasons for this were both practical
and ideological. </p>
<p>In practical terms, colonial politicians and voters were concerned to
maintain the rights of local self-government they had exercised
since the
1850s.<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></sup> Samuel Griffith expressed
the view of many when he observed, remarkably, that the Australian colonies had
been 'accustomed for so
long to self-government' that they had 'become
practically almost sovereign states, a great deal more sovereign states, though
not
in name, than the separate states of
America.'<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup> In this context, the
creation of a unitary nation-state of Australia was both impossible and
unthinkable. As Griffith later affirmed,
the 'essential' and 'preliminary'
condition of federation was that:</p>
<blockquote>
the separate states are to continue as autonomous bodies, surrendering only so
much of their powers as is necessary to the establishment
of a general
government to do for them collectively what they cannot do individually for
themselves, and which they cannot do as
a collective body for
themselves.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Only
a compromise, along fundamentally federal lines, would suffice to integrate the
separate colonies. The federating process, focused
in a series of inter-colonial
conferences and conventions, provided ample opportunity for the meticulous
negotiations that would
be
necessary.<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The theories and scholarship of the day reinforced the practical
considerations. In the late nineteenth century, 'federation' was
widely
considered to be the best means by which separate peoples inhabiting extended
territories could be united by a lasting political
bond. As Manning Clark
pointed out, 'federations had the warm approval of important writers on
political theory' and were 'the fashion
for communities in the New
World'.<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup> Baron de Montesquieu and
Alexis de Tocqueville had long since argued that confederations enjoyed the
strengths, and avoided the weaknesses,
of small, independent republics and
large, consolidated empires.<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup>
Leading contemporary authors like Edward Freeman could write of 'the absolute
perfection of the Federal
ideal.'<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup> Indeed, most of the
American luminaries continued to think that federalism had been the correct
choice for their own country, despite
the ravages of the Civil
War.<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup> And even while Americans
were passing through the difficult post-war era, the federal ideal remained
sufficiently attractive for
the Canadians to adopt a more or less federal
solution to their own intractable problems of cultural
diversity.<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup> Given that the
several Australian colonies inhabited a vast continent similar to the North
Americans, they also looked to federal
models when considering how a 'nation for
a continent' might be established. </p>
<p>The leading federal models of the day were thus the United States and Canada,
as well as Switzerland. Illustrious political scientists
and constitutional
lawyers, such as James Bryce and Albert Venn Dicey, had undertaken extensive
studies of these systems.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup>
Distinguished legal historians, such as Henry Maine, Edward Freeman and Otto von
Gierke, also drew attention to other important models,
such as the 'leagues' of
the ancient Greek city-states and the Holy Roman Empire, the latter as
interpreted by Johannes Althusius
in the early seventeenth
century.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup> Althusius's own theory
of the federative commonwealth&#8212;in which small political communities, at
the scale of towns and cities,
gradually covenant together to form progressively
wider political communities at a regional, national and supra-national
level&#8212;seems
to have been forgotten for a
time.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup> But well-known luminaries
as diverse as Thomas Jefferson, David Hume and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon had
championed very similar, federalistic
ideals,<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup> and late in the
nineteenth century Gierke, Bryce and Frederic Maitland were again drawing
attention to Althusius's
importance.<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup> Images and symbols
such as these profoundly shaped late nineteenth century conceptions of
federalism.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading45"></a><b>A	Identifying the key sources</b></h3>
<p>Among these and the many other sources, how do we identify those that most
significantly influenced the Australians? A survey of citations
in the
Convention debates, the colonial Parliamentary debates, and in Australian books,
articles and speeches outside those formal
venues, is a starting
point.<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup> A quantitative assessment
of these materials confirms the United States, Canada and Switzerland to be the
key models,<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup> with the American
pre-eminent among them, and Bryce, Freeman and Dicey to be the their leading
expositors. The Australian framers
also drew extensively on the opinions and
commentaries on the American <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> by notables such as James
Wilson, John Jay, Alexander Hamilton and, especially, James Madison. The
<i>Federalist Papers</i>, composed by the latter three authors, were decisively
important in a number of respects. The framing of the American
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and the later development of American institutions was
readily accessible through the primary sources edited by Jonathan Elliot and
Benjamin Perley Poore, and was further explained by leading historians of the
day, such as George Bancroft and John Fiske. The Australians
also drew on a
number of later writers, such as Alexis de Tocqueville, John Marshall, James
Kent, John C Calhoun, Daniel Webster,
Joseph Story, Thomas Cooley, John W
Burgess, Westel Willoughby, Andrew Baker, Roger Foster and Woodrow
Wilson.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In addition to sources that were specifically concerned with American
federalism, the framers also learned a great deal about Switzerland
and Canada
from authors such as Francis Adams and C D Cunningham, John Bourinot,
Goldwin Smith and Charles Borgeaud. In turn, the
English constitutional system,
responsible government and the law of the British Empire were explained by
Dicey, Walter Bagehot,
Thomas Erskine May, W E Hearn, David Syme, Alpheus
Todd and others. Knowledge derived from these sources supplemented the intimate
knowledge the Australians had of the working of their own systems of responsible
government. The Australians occasionally even cited
'classic' works of political
philosophy, such as those of John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, James Harrington, Jeremy
Bentham and John Stuart
Mill.<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>The qualitative significance of these works and their substantive influence
in Australia must be assessed in the light of the actual
terms of debate over
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. For present purposes, attention must especially be
given to the particular works upon which the leading Australian protagonists
chiefly relied for their central arguments about the meaning of federalism.
While there were many outstanding figures among the Australian
framers, it is
arguable that the various approaches to federalism contending for incorporation
into the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> were amply represented in the views of Andrew
Inglis Clark, Samuel Griffith, Richard Baker, Edmund Barton, Alfred Deakin, John
Quick,
Robert Garran, Isaac Isaacs and Henry Bournes
Higgins.<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup> In turn, when it is
asked what sources most critically influenced the conceptions of federalism
adhered to by these key participants,
the following writers (again) emerge:
Hamilton, Madison, Jay, Bryce, Freeman and Dicey&#8212;as well as the neglected
figure of John
Burgess. As will be seen in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a>, works by these authors
presented the most important theories of federalism that influenced the framers
of the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Such writings of course embodied perspectives at least as diverse as the
Australians themselves&#8212;as framers, politicians, lawyers,
publicists,
labour leaders and others involved in the public debate over federation. Each of
the sources clearly had its own orientations,
and the Australians used the
sources in accordance with their individual priorities. What lessons on
questions of federalism did
these sources convey to the Australians?</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading56"></a><b>B	Lessons for Australian federalism</b></h3>
<p>In order to explain the conceptions of federalism advanced by writers such as
Madison, Freeman, Bryce, Dicey and Burgess, it is first
necessary to consider
the leading 'federal' models, and the principal lessons the Australians derived
from them. </p>
<p>For the Australians, the United States of America was undoubtedly the
paradigm of federations. Central to the lessons that it provided
for the
Australians were the formative process by which the separate American states
integrated themselves into a 'federal republic',
the institutions that enabled
the peoples of the states and the people of the nation to be represented in the
federal legislature,
the manner in which federal legislative power was
distributed, and the means by which the entire arrangement could be amended. The
Swiss <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> reinforced these lessons, for it showed that these
aspects of the American system could be reproduced elsewhere. Switzerland also
provided an example of a non-Presidential model of executive government suitable
to a republican federation, and it demonstrated
how federalism could be
integrated with direct, popular participation by way of referendum. </p>
<p>However, the United States and Switzerland were republics, and the
Australians recognised that a federation of the Australian colonies
would have
to be instituted under the Imperial Crown and the authority of the Parliament at
Westminster. Canada's importance, therefore,
was that it showed the Australians
how a federal system could be adapted to an Imperial, monarchical and
parliamentary system. </p>
<p>If these were the central ideas derived by the Australians from these
constitutional models, what were the lessons to be drawn from
Madison, Bryce,
Freeman, Dicey and Burgess? Broadly
speaking,<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup> the first three
writers presented detailed empirical and historical accounts of federalism, and
they did so in a manner relatively
free from overt theorising. On the other
hand, the latter two authors were more formalistic in approach, and Burgess in
particular
sought to advance a more rationalistic, <i>a priori</i> theory of
federalism which was much less concerned to account for the empirical details of
actual federations. </p>
<p>Of his many important writings, James Madison's famous <i>Federalist No
39</i> was his most influential statement of the meaning of American federalism.
While politically calculated to advance the ratification
of the <i>American</i>
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, in this essay<i> </i>Madison presented to his readers a
careful empirical analysis of the proposed <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. In particular,
Madison closely analysed the way in which the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> had been
ratified, the representative institutions adopted thereunder, the mode of the
distribution of powers, the manner in which
federal laws were executed and the
method by which the arrangement could be formally amended. </p>
<p>In the context of the American debate over the meaning of federalism,
Madison's analysis was a mediating one, more empirically precise
than two
alternative, more dogmatic, points of view. These two other points of view both
maintained, following William Blackstone,
that an <i>imperium in
imperio</i>&#8212;a sovereign within the jurisdiction of another
sovereign&#8212;was political heresy. There could only be one sovereign entity
within a particular political system. However, the two points of view differed
as to where they attributed this sovereignty. Those
who were nationalistically
inclined, such as James Wilson, John Marshall and Daniel Webster, held that
sovereignty rested with the
people of the nation as a whole, so that the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> derived from their authority and should be amended by that
same authority. Others, like Luther Martin, Thomas Jefferson and John
C Calhoun,
were inclined to insist that sovereignty rested with each of the several states,
which had compacted themselves into a
confederation in which they retained
ultimate sovereignty as separate
polities.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Debate over the meaning of American federalism&#8212;before and after the
formation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>&#8212;often adhered to this dichotomy, and
the Australians were aware of its contours. However, these extreme views could
not do
justice to the empirical detail of the American <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, a
scheme in which sovereignty, <i>if</i> it existed, seemed to be dispersed
throughout the system. As Madison's analysis suggested, the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
therefore consisted of <i>both</i> 'compactual' and 'national' elements. His
analysis, as will be seen, deeply influenced many of the Australians. </p>
<p>James Bryce's <i>American Commonwealth</i> presented the American system in
terms fairly consistent with Madison's mediating analysis. While some of Bryce's
dogmatic inclinations
could not be suppressed, his empirical, descriptive
approach presented America essentially as a 'Commonwealth of commonwealths, a
Republic of republics, a state which, while one, is nevertheless composed of
other states even more essential to its existence than
it is to
theirs'.<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a></sup> Bryce was therefore
critical of 'metaphysical' theories of sovereignty developed in the United
States by those seeking to locate
ultimate sovereignty in either the whole
people <i>or</i> the peoples of the several states&#8212;namely the nationalist
and compactualist approaches to American
federalism.<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[35]</a></sup> The American system
seemed to embody some kind of <i>imperium in imperio</i>, and Bryce's account of
American federalism tended to reinforce Madison's idea of a 'compound republic'
consisting of both compactual
and national elements.</p>
<p>Edward Freeman's <i>History of Federal Government</i> provided a similarly
descriptive account of federalism. His classification system, derived from the
renowned Swiss constitutional
authority, J K Bluntschli, distinguished
between <i>staatenbund</i> (confederation) and <i>bundesstaat</i> (federation)
on the basis of whether or not the federal government had direct authority to
execute federal laws against
individuals.<sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a></sup> This contrasted
with the approach of the equally prominent German scholar, Georg Jellinek, who
distinguished between the two species
of political system on the basis of
whether 'sovereignty' inhered in the constituent states or the federation as a
whole.<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a></sup> Unlike Jellinek, Freeman
was not dogmatically concerned to determine whether sovereignty inhered in the
states or the nation. Like
Bryce, his detailed historical accounts of the
various federal systems of history brought out the same idea of a Commonwealth
constructed
out of constituent commonwealths, a 'federal commonwealth' having
both compactual and national elements. </p>
<p>In his <i>Introduction to the Study of the</i> <i>Law of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, Albert Dicey also acknowledged that classic federations, such
as the United States and Switzerland, arose through the integration
of
constituent member states. However, the idea of sovereignty, derived from
Dicey's famous thesis concerning the sovereignty of
the British Parliament, led
him to define federalism in more 'formal' and 'static' terms, as a system where
'the <i>ordinary powers of sovereignty</i> are elaborately divided' between the
federal and state governments.<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></sup>
For Dicey, the terms of this distribution of power are set out in a written
constitution, which is enforced by a judiciary that is
independent of both the
federal and state governments. Thus while Dicey recognised the compactual
origins of federations, his legalistic
definition of federalism conceived of a
theoretically consolidated body of sovereign power which is then <i>divided</i>,
rather than of several mutually independent political communities that agree to
a form of union in which particular powers are <i>conferred</i> on the federal
government.</p>
<p>The concept of the 'sovereign state' played an even more significant role in
John Burgess's theory of federalism, as set out in his
<i>Political Science and
Comparative <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
Law</i>.<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a></sup> Dicey had certainly
claimed that the Parliament of the United Kingdom was 'sovereign', but he did
not generalise to all political
systems. Burgess, however, dogmatically insisted
that there <i>must</i> be a 'sovereign authority' in <i>every</i> political
society. Dicey had admitted that the classic federations had arisen when
constituent states agreed to unite, and that the
terms of this agreement
involved a division of power between the states and the federation. But for
Burgess, a federation arises
when a sovereign, unitary nation-state decides to
distribute the powers of sovereignty among regional and central governing
institutions.
Following Jellinek, he therefore considered that there were only
two kinds of 'federal' system: a sovereign, unitary nation-state
that happens to
divide governmental power between two levels of government ('federation'), and a
loose association of separate states
that retain their individual sovereignties
('confederation'). </p>
<p>However, Burgess's insistence on a fundamental distinction between federation
and confederation along the lines of sovereignty posed
difficulties when it came
to explaining the institutional details of actual federations. Features of the
American and Swiss constitutions
that pointed back their compactual origins,
such as the special status of the states recognised in both the Senate and the
amending
formula, were incomprehensible, and had to be dismissed as 'relic[s] of
confederatism', and undemocratic
'error[s]'.<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a></sup> Burgess could not
account for many of the institutional details that led a more empirically
inclined Madison to conclude that the
American <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was a
'composition' of both compactual and national elements. </p>
<p>These leading sources of Australian ideas about federalism&#8212;Madison,
Bryce, Freeman, Dicey and Burgess&#8212;thus presented markedly
different
accounts of federalism, each with its particular implications for the emergent
Federal Commonwealth of Australia. It remains
now to examine the Australian
appropriation of these sources.</p>

APPROPRIATIONS</b></h2>
<p>It has been said that the assortment of approaches to federalism adopted by
the Australians are well represented by leading figures
such as Inglis Clark,
Griffith, Baker, Barton, Deakin, Quick, Garran, Isaacs and Higgins. These
individuals relied on the various
conceptions of federalism canvassed in the
previous section, they contributed significantly to the Australian debate, and
their writings
and speeches are important both as statements of their own views
and as influences on others. Among them, Baker, Just, Quick and
Garran wrote
'handbooks' of reference specifically for the edification of delegates to the
Conventions of 1891 and 1897-8, and Inglis
Clark, Quick and Garran published
important commentaries on the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Isaacs and Higgins are also
important, not so much because their views were embodied in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, but because they often articulated the antithetical views
to which the dominant theses had to respond. A kind of synthesis emerged
among
the various views.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this article, works by Just, Inglis Clark, Baker, Quick,
Garran, Isaacs and Higgins are surveyed in order to identify
the way in which
the various 'models' of federalism and 'interpretations' thereof were
appropriated by the framers of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Space
precludes a detailed discussion of a number of other very important Australian
works, but in my view the writings addressed
in this article are sufficiently
representative to provide a fair survey of the key influences and perspectives
on questions of Australian
federalism.<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Before taking this further, however, an important distinction must briefly be
noted. Many of the writings analysed herein were produced
in an effort to
'inform' the delegates to the Federal Conventions and thereby influence the
content of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> as drafted. However, there were other texts
written specifically as part of the debate over the 'ratification' of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> Bill by referendum, and there were others that advanced
interpretations of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> after its enactment into law. Each of
these kinds of text is&#8212;in its own way&#8212;relevant to my objective of
identifying the
ways in which federalism was understood by those who were most
influential in the drafting of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. However, each text must
be interpreted in the light of its particular context and objectives, as I
endeavour to do in what follows.

<a name="_Toc511205224"></a><a name="_Toc511472934"></a><a name="_Toc511495462"></a><a name="Heading84"></a><b>A	Thomas
Just</b></h3>
<p>One of the important studies of federalism written specifically for the
edification of delegates to the Federal Convention of 1891
was Thomas Just's
<i>Leading Facts Connected with Federation </i>(1891). Just probably compiled
<i>Leading Facts</i> on the instructions of the Tasmanian Attorney-General,
Andrew Inglis Clark,<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></sup> so the
sources reproduced by Just are of utmost significance.</p>
<p>Just provided his readers with an extended description of the United States
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, together with shorter descriptions of the constitutional
systems of Canada, Switzerland, Mexico and the Leeward Islands. He<i> </i>drew
on a wide variety of materials, including official dispatches, reports,
statistics, statutes, conference proceedings and extracts
from newspaper
articles, scholarly journals and books. He also provided an extensive
bibliography in which many of the crucial authors
appeared, including Bryce,
Dicey, Freeman, Adams and Cunningham, Poore, Bancroft, Fiske, Smith, and
Todd.<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[43]</a></sup> </p>
<p><i>Leading Facts</i> was not only descriptive. It contained a number of
statements of political principle and practical necessity, and the extracts that
it reproduced were organised in a way that was apparently calculated to guide
the reader in a certain direction. Most conspicuous
among these were a number of
extracts from <i>The Federalist Papers</i>. In Just's presentation, they seemed
to provide appropriate guidance on almost all important issues relating to
Australian federation,
apparently on the premise that 'the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of the
United States was framed under similar circumstances to those which should mark
the formation of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of United
Australasia.'<sup><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>This was a remarkable claim for Just to make, given that the Australian
colonies were still subject to Imperial sovereignty. That
republican
implications may have been intended is suggested by Just's reproduction of the
arguments of John Dunmore Lang, Head of
the Presbyterian College in Sydney and
Member of the NSW Parliament. Lang&#8212;whom Charles Duffy said had 'reared a
generation
of students destined to become public men'&#8212;fervently believed
that the Australian colonies should be accorded 'complete independence'
as
'separate and independent communities' under 'the law of nature and the
ordinance of God'. As presented by Just, Lang derived
inspiration from the
'American Union as exemplified in the New England States', where the states
enjoyed 'complete independence;
that is, the entire control of all matters
affecting their interests, as men and as citizens, in every possible way.' Lang
urged
that the Australian colonies should likewise 'combine' into a federation
in order to secure a greater 'weight or influence in the
family of nations'.
However, he also desired that the constituent states should not merely retain a
'municipal independence' in 'little
matters', but 'the entire control of all
matters affecting their
interests'.<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[45]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Just was centrally concerned to explain how the American example could
instruct the Australians, and he did so by posing three important
questions: (1)
'How [should] the question [of federation] ... be approached'? (2) What are the
possible 'modes of federation'? (3)
What is the true 'character of the American
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'? In answering these questions, he sought to integrate the leading
ideas of the <i>Federalist Papers</i> with current discussions about federalism
within the Australian colonies. In so doing, he introduced his Australian
readers to the
views of Baron de Montesquieu, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and
James Madison, and sought to show how their perspectives could be
applied to
Australian conditions. </p>
<p>Commencing with Alexander Hamilton's <i>Federalist No 1</i> and John Jay's
<i>Federalist Nos 2</i> and <i>4</i>, Just underscored the advantages of 'one
strong government' that is able to 'move on uniform principles of policy' and to
'harmonise,
assimilate, and protect the several parts and members' of a federal
commonwealth, extending 'the benefits of its foresight and precautions
to each'.
According to Just, the need in Australia for a government of such 'efficiency'
and 'rigour' arose from the fact that into
the 1890s, inter-colonial
negotiations and arrangements had regularly broken down in the face of the
requirement that decisions be
made unanimously and executed separately in each
colony. Reproducing papers by William Foster, Agent-General for New South Wales,
and a reply published by the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, Just presented an
analysis of the decision-making rules that had led to this problem, and proposed
an alternative set of rules that
should prevail under a more rigorous and
efficient federal government. </p>
<p>Fearing excessive centralisation, Foster had been concerned that if majority
vote was adopted at a federal level 'the interests and
feelings of remote and
insignificant portions of the [proposed] Federation' would be 'sacrificed to
those of the dominant majority'.
The <i>Herald</i> replied that federation
rested on an 'agreement among a group of coterminous Colonies'; and that
questions of '<i>common </i>concern' would be addressed by '<i>joint
</i>action', while 'purely local matters' would remain 'exclusively under the
jurisdiction of the Colonial Legislatures'. Moreover, the
<i>Herald</i> argued,
inter-colonial conferences had failed because 'the minority ... are not bound by
the decisions of the majority' and the 'decisions
of the majority are not
binding on their respective legislatures'. In the same way, federation would
fail unless majority vote was
adopted 'in matters of <i>common</i> concern.' In
short, the 'almost hopeless condition of unanimity' must, under federation, be
replaced by 'majority'.<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[46]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Putting these points together, Just apparently sought to show that it was
necessary to have a strong federal government in which the
will of the majority
prevailed, but that such a government must first be formed with the consent of
each of the several colonies
as independent bodies politic. As the <i>Herald
</i>had maintained, a federation comes into being by unanimous agreement of the
constituent bodies politic, and they agree to confer limited
functions on a
central government that makes its decisions by majority rule, but the remainder
of their constituent and governmental
powers are retained. </p>
<p>Just also felt it important to draw the attention of his Australian readers
to Hamilton's famous discussion of Montesquieu's classic
definition of the
'Confederate Republic'. As reproduced by Just, Montesquieu had said:</p>
<blockquote>
It is very probable that mankind would have been obliged, at length, to live
constantly under the Government of a single person,
had they not contrived a
kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a Republican,
together with the external force
of a Monarchical, Government&#8212;I mean a
Confederate Republic.<br>
This form of Government is a convention by which several smaller <i>States</i>
agree to become members of a <i>larger</i> one, which they intend to form. It is
a kind of assemblage of societies, that constitutes a new one, capable of
increasing by means
of new associations till they arrive at such a degree of
power as to be able to provide for the security of the united body. ...
As this
Government is composed of small Republics, it enjoys the internal happiness of
each, and with respect to its external situation,
it is possessed, by means of
the association, of all the advantages of large Monarchies.<br>
A Republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may support itself
without any internal corruption. ... As this Government
is composed of small
Republics, it enjoys the internal happiness of each, and with respect to its
external situation, it is possessed,
by means of the association, of all the
advantages of large
Monarchies.<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[47]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
Montesquieu's day, political reflection suggested that large, territorial
monarchies had the advantage of external security, but
they also suffered the
internal disadvantage of a tendency to despotism, whereas the small republic had
the advantage of a virtuous
citizenry actively participating in the government,
but suffered the external disadvantage of susceptibility to assimilation by
larger
powers. Montesquieu suggested that the advantages of each might be
secured in what he called the confederate republic. </p>
<p>Hamilton commented on this idea in <i>Federalist No 9</i>. As reproduced by
Just, Hamilton proposed that the 'definition' of a 'Confederate Republic' or
'Federal Government' was 'an assemblage
of societies' or 'an association of two
or more States into one State'. So long, Hamilton maintained, that the 'separate
organisation
of the members be not abolished', but rather exists 'by a
constitutional necessity for local purposes', then despite their 'subordination'
to an additional 'general authority' or national government created for specific
purposes, the scheme remains 'an Association of
States or a Confederacy'.
Indeed, Hamilton pointed out, the proposed United States <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
treated the states as 'constituent parts' of the Union, allowing them 'direct
representation in the Senate' and leaving them with
'certain exclusive and very
important portions of the sovereign
power'.<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[48]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In this sense, Thomas Just used Montesquieu and Hamilton to present the idea
that federation is essentially an 'assembly of States'
which is at the same time
itself a 'State', and in which the several states are constituent members,
entitled to separate representation
in the institutions of the federal
government and an exclusive sphere of 'sovereign' power over their own internal
affairs.<sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[49]</a></sup> On this foundation,
Just then turned to James Madison's famous description of the true 'character of
the American <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>' in <i>Federalist No
39</i>.<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[50]</a></sup> Madison sought there to
address the argument of Antifederalists that the proposed <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
was not genuinely 'federal' in character, but amounted to a national
'consolidation' or a unitary nation-state. He responded that,
in truth, there
were both 'federal' (meaning 'compactual') and 'national' aspects in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, and that all things considered, it was 'neither a national
nor a federal <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, but a composition of both'. </p>
<p>Madison's exposition began with an analytical division of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> into five essential components. As reproduced by Just,
Madison observed:</p>
<blockquote>
In order to ascertain the real character of the Government, it may be considered
in relation to the foundation on which it is to
be established; to the sources
from which its ordinary powers are to be drawn; to the operation of those
powers; to the extent of
them; and to the authority by which future changes in
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> are to be
introduced.<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[51]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
approaching the question in this way, Madison brought greater conceptual clarity
to the observations of Montesquieu and Hamilton.
Madison's 'foundation on which
it is established' concerned the 'formative basis' of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>,
the process by which the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was ratified and came into force.
By 'the sources from which the ordinary powers of government are to be derived'
Madison meant the
representative institutions adopted for the federal
government, namely the House of Representatives, the Senate and the Presidency.
The 'operation of those powers' had to do with the direct authority of the
federal government over individual citizens, an important
feature of the
proposed <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> that distinguished it from the <i>Articles of
Confederation</i> (1781), under which 'federal' decisions had to be separately
enforced by each state. Madison's reference to 'the extent of them'
had to do
with the supremacy of the federal government within its 'sphere' of 'enumerated
objects', in contrast to the 'residuary
and inviolable sovereignty over all
other objects' enjoyed by the several States&#8212;in short, but less
accurately, the so-called
'division of powers' between the federation and the
states. Finally, the 'authority by which future changes ... are to be
introduced'
referred to the means of 'amendment' of the federal
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. Unlike other writers on federalism, then and now, Madison
focused equally on the five aspects: formation, representation, operation
of
federal power, 'division' of power and amendment.</p>
<p>Just made clear that Madison had identified both 'national' and 'federal'
characteristics in these aspects of the system, and had
concluded that the
proposed <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was best understood as 'a composition of
both'.<sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[52]</a></sup> Just decided, however,
only to reproduce the first part of Madison's analysis, his examination of the
formative basis of the federation,
followed by Madison's general conclusions on
the entire scheme. </p>
<p>On the question of the foundation of the proposed <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>,
Madison concluded that the proposed <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was fully 'federal' in
character. In coming to this conclusion, he noted that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
was to be 'founded on the assent and ratification of the people of America', but
he pointed out that 'this assent and ratification
is to be given by the people
not as individuals composing one entire nation, but as composing the distinct
and independent States
to which they respectively belong.' Drawing these two
aspects together, it appeared that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> rested on the 'assent
and ratification of the several States, derived from the supreme authority in
each State&#8212;the authority
of the people themselves'. Madison could conclude
that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> rested on a 'federal', rather than a 'national'
basis, precisely because the act of ratification was by 'the people as forming
so
many independent States', rather than the people 'as forming one aggregate
nation'.<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>In support of this conclusion, Madison pointed out that a fully 'national'
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> would derive its authority from an expression of 'the will
of the majority of the whole people of the United States', expressed either
through a majority of individual voters or perhaps through a majority of states
as representing the voters of the nation. However,
he insisted, this approach
had not been adopted. The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> would not arise 'from the decision
of a <i>majority</i> of the people of the Union; nor from that of a
<i>majority</i> of the States', but from the 'unanimous consent of the several
States that are parties to it,' expressed 'not by the legislative
authority',
but by 'the people themselves'. Indeed, he went so far as to say that '[e]ach
State in ratifying the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> is considered as a Sovereign body,
independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary act.' It
was clear, Madison
concluded, that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> would, if
established, be fully 'federal', and not 'national', in terms of its
foundation.<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, when it came to an analysis of the other aspects of the proposed
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, Madison observed important 'national' characteristics, as
well as a number of continuing 'federal' ones. His ultimate conclusion,
as
reproduced by Just, was that:</p>
<blockquote>
The proposed <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, therefore, even when tested by the rules laid down by
its antagonists, is in strictness neither a National nor a Federal <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>,
but a composition of both. In its foundation it is Federal, not National; in the
resources from which the ordinary powers of the
Government are drawn, it is
partly Federal and partly National; in the operation of these powers it is
National, not Federal; in
the extent of them again it is Federal, not National;
and finally, in the authoritative mode of introduction amendments, it is neither
wholly Federal nor wholly
National.<sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[55]</a></sup></blockquote><p>It must
be noted that Madison used the terms 'federal' and 'national' as they were used
in his time and place.<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[56]</a></sup> By
contrast, current usage furnishes us with at least three categories:
'confederation', 'federation' and 'unitary
state'.<sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[57]</a></sup> Madison's 'federal' and
'national' generally correspond with the current ideas of confederation and
unitary state, whereas his 'combination
of both' neatly fits the current
conception of federation.<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[58]</a></sup> We
have seen that Madison considered that a 'federal' system arises when several
'distinct and independent States' 'unanimously assent'
to a proposed union. The
proposed <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was in this respect 'federal' because it was
unanimously ratified by the people of each independent state. The lesson for the
readers
of Just's <i>Leading Facts </i>was that Australian federation must
proceed likewise. </p>
<p>While not specifically reproduced by Just, Madison continued that a 'federal'
government will 'derive its powers' from the states
'as political and co-equal
societies', and these will be equally represented in that government, whereas a
'national' government
will be composed of representatives of the people of the
entire nation. Since the proposed <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> provided for the
representation of the peoples of the states in the Senate, the people of the
nation as a whole in the House of Representatives,
and the representation of
both in the means by which the President was elected, Madison concluded that the
representative institutions
were partly federal and partly national. Next, for
Madison, a 'federal' government will 'operate' only on the States in their
'political
capacities'; its laws will <i>not</i> operate directly on individual
citizens, but only through the states, whereas the laws of a 'national'
government will be directly
enforced against individuals by the federal
government. Since the proposed <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> provided for the latter, it
was 'national' in this respect. Further, a 'federal' system will be marked by a
limited jurisdiction
over 'certain enumerated objects only', the several states
retaining a 'residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects',
whereas a 'national' government will have supreme legislative jurisdiction over
'all persons and things' without limitation. Because
the proposed federal
legislature was given legislative power over only limited topics, the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was 'federal' in this respect. Finally, for Madison, a
'federal' constitution will only be amended with the 'concurrence' of each
and
every State, that is, unanimously, whereas the amendment of a truly 'national'
constitution will rest with the 'majority of the
people' of the nation as a
whole. However, since the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> could only be amended by special
majority, the rule was neither one of unanimity nor of simple majority, and
therefore neither federal
nor national, but a combination of
both.<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[59]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The implicit lesson for Just's Australian readers, it seems, was that an
Australian federation should be similarly 'partly federal,
partly national', a
'combination of both' or, as Joseph Story later explained, 'a compound
republic'.<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[60]</a></sup> While Just did not
reproduce the entirety of Madison's analysis, a number of Australians later
cited Hamilton, Madison and Story
on the American 'compromise' between 'pure
federation' and 'national union', using their writings to support equal
representation
in the Senate and proportional representation in the House as
appropriate to a compound
republic.<sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[61]</a></sup> As will be seen, Quick
and Garran systematically used Madison's analysis to identify the national and
federal features of the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the remainder of <i>Leading Facts</i>, Just included a brief sketch of the
events which led to the formation of the American federal and state
constitutions. He described
the representative structure of the federal
government and the use of counties as the basis of apportionment. He also
reproduced
opinions concerning the appropriate powers to be 'transferred to the
Federal Parliament from the Colonial Legislatures'. The American
model,
interpreted in the light of Madison's <i>No 39</i>, loomed large in his
analysis.<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[63]</a></sup> </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading134"></a><b>B	Andrew Inglis Clark</b></h3>
<p>Andrew Inglis Clark wrote one of two influential first drafts of an
Australian federal constitution for the 1891
Convention.<sup><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[64]</a></sup> It is not unlikely
that Just's book set forth the basic perspective from which Inglis Clark's draft
was prepared,<sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[65]</a></sup> but a confidential
memorandum written by Inglis Clark himself elaborated the reasoning that lay
behind the drafting.<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[66]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the memorandum, Inglis Clark adhered to his well-known preference for the
American over the Canadian model of federalism. However,
he also drew attention
to Switzerland, which, he said, 'presents several unique and very instructive
features in the purely democratical
organisation of
society'.<sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[67]</a></sup> He pointed out that in
contrast to the later Canadian model, the American federation was 'brought about
by the voluntary union of
thirteen independent communities', and that this made
'inevitable' the scheme by which 'a limited number of specific powers' were
'delegated' to the federal government, while the powers 'not delegated' were
'reserved' to the states and to the people. In Australia,
he argued, while the
colonies were not 'sovereign', yet they performed more functions than the
American states had done, and he therefore
followed the American scheme in its
federal aspects. In particular, what he called the 'provinces' were to be
equally represented
in the Senate, whereas the House of Representatives was to
be 'chosen by the people of the provinces strictly on the basis of population'.
Specific powers were delegated to the federal legislature, with all powers not
delegated remaining 'vested in the provincial parliaments'.
The federal
judiciary was, following the American example, distinct from the provincial
judicial systems, but with the 'innovation'
of a general appellate jurisdiction
to replace the Privy Council. Moreover, unlike the Canadian system, the State
Governors were
appointed separately from the federal government, this being
'essential to secure the independence of the provincial governments.'
However,
the draft <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> presumed a continuance of cabinet government and
dependency on the Empire, and the Canadian model provided appropriate guidance
in
these respects.<sup><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[68]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While Inglis Clark considered that the 'dependency' of the Australian
colonies on the Imperial Crown posed an obstacle to adopting
a fully republican
system in Australia, he wondered whether 'the united intelligence of the
[forthcoming] Convention [might] be able
to suggest some method of meeting the
difficulty'.<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[69]</a></sup> In fact, Inglis
Clark expressed severe reservations about responsible government. He favourably
discussed the American system, but
particularly suggested that the Swiss system
of a federal executive council was 'an example which might be followed', quoting
Edward
Freeman to the effect that the 'negative wisdom' of the Swiss Government
might be preferable to both the British and American
systems.<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his later book, <i>Australian Constitutional Law</i> (1901), Inglis Clark
looked back on the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> that had been enacted into law by the
Imperial Parliament. In this work, he elaborated extensively on the nature of
federalism and
the features of the newly formed <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.
A V Dicey had said that, in essence, 'federalism means legalism and
the supremacy of the Judiciary in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>', and Inglis Clark seemed to
agree. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
The federal form of political organisation exists whenever a number of
separately organised communities are embraced in one comprehensive
community and
the whole field of legislative and executive authority is definitely divided
between the legislative and executive
organs of the larger and comprehensive
community on the one hand, and the legislative and the executive organs of each
of the component
communities on the
other.<sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[71]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Federalism,
according to Inglis Clark, is a system where several 'separately organised
communities are embraced in one comprehensive
community'. Consequent to this
scheme, there is, following Dicey, an elaborate 'division' of legislative and
executive power between
the comprehensive and component communities. Unlike
Dicey, however, Inglis Clark did not refer to a division of the 'original powers
of sovereignty'. The central question of federalism, Inglis Clark thought, is
how to unite a number of separate political societies
into a composite society
in a manner that preserves the 'collective and corporate life of each State'.
The American and Australian
solution was to define the boundaries of the two
sets of political communities, to create a dual citizenship and, most
importantly,
to give a majority of the component communities and the majority of
the composite community 'concurrent powers of veto' over proposed
legislation
and proposed constitutional amendments. In Inglis Clark's view, the formative
concern to preserve the constituent states
led to a system of federal
representation and federal
amendment.<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[72]</a></sup></p>

Baker</b></h3>
<p>Accompanying Thomas Just's <i>Leading Facts</i> was Richard Chaffey Baker's
<i>Manual of Reference</i>, also written for the 1891 Convention, later joined
by Baker's <i>Federation</i> and <i>The Executive in a Federation</i>, written
for the 1897-8 Convention.<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[73]</a></sup> Baker
was a conservative member of the Legislative Council of South Australia and an
important delegate at both Federal Conventions.
In the <i>Manual</i>, his
objective was to seek guidance 'from the study of existing Federal Constitutions
and their working', by undertaking 'a comparison
of the provisions' of the
American, Canadian, Swiss and South African constitutions. The <i>Manual</i>
included schedules containing the Quebec Resolutions, the Canadian
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, the American <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and the <i>South African
Union Act</i> <i>1877</i>. His schedule of books cited indicates the sources on
which he drew and to which he directed his fellow delegates. They included
Adams
and Cunningham, Bagehot, Bluntschli, Bourinot, Bryce, Dicey, Freeman, Smith,
Hamilton, Madison, Jay, Kent, Montesquieu, Story,
Tocqueville and
Webster.<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[74]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Although the <i>Manual</i> was professedly intended only to provide
information and reference to relevant authorities, its choice of references and
its organisation
provide an insight into the structure of Baker's reasoning
about federalism. In particular, he began with the 'mode of formation'
of the
four constitutions, he next considered the organisation of the executive and
legislature, then the allocation of powers, and
finally the ratification of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and the use of referenda. The similarity to Madison's
analytical scheme and the structure of the American <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> is
notable. This structure apparently shaped Baker's ultimate conclusions, although
he expressed a number of views in the <i>Manual</i> that he later modified. </p>
<p>Baker rejected John C Calhoun's theory that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> 'is a
compact to which the States were parties in their sovereign capacities', seeming
to favour Daniel Webster's argument that the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> derived from
'the people of the United
States'.<sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[75]</a></sup> However, Baker also
recounted the ratification of the American, Swiss and Canadian constitutions in
a way that showed that ratification
was secured on a 'state-by-state' basis,
contrary to Webster's contention and in accord with Madison's
analysis.<sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[76]</a></sup> Baker also rejected
Walter Bagehot's arguments against co-equal houses in a federation, citing James
Kent to the effect that the
American Senate involved the recognition of the
'separate and independent existence' of the
States.<sup><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[77]</a></sup> At this early stage,
Baker also favoured responsible
government,<sup><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[78]</a></sup> but he would soon
conclude that the consolidating tendencies of responsible government were
inconsistent with equality of representation
of the States in a powerful
Senate.<sup><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>Baker's overriding objective was that the 'powers of self-government' enjoyed
by 'the Australian people' might be 'increased', and
that the exercise of those
powers might 'be delegated partly to a National or Federal Government and partly
to the present Provincial
Governments'.<sup><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[80]</a></sup> As such, local
self-government, state independence and state equality&#8212;expressed in the
formative basis, representative structures
and amending formula of the
constitutions under discussion&#8212;emerged as key principles. The
representation of the people of the
nation in the House of Representatives, and
the equal representation of the people 'as citizens of the States' in a Senate
of 'at
least co-equal power', were therefore of 'the very essence' of
federation.<sup><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[81]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Baker adopted J K Bluntschli's distinction between federation and
confederation&#8212;on the criterion of direct central executive
authority over
individuals&#8212;and not Georg Jellinek's all-embracing 'sovereignty'
criterion.<sup><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[82]</a></sup> Those of Baker's
readers who agreed, could thereby avoid the problem of identifying an ultimate
locus of 'sovereignty' within the
proposed Australian federation. As will be
seen in the later discussion of Quick, Garran, Higgins and Isaacs, those who
adopted the
concept of sovereignty as a necessary analytical device were forced
to choose between the 'compactualist', state-sovereignty views
of Calhoun and
the national-sovereignty views of Webster&#8212;and most of them chose the
latter. However, the actual <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> that emerged was, in terms of
Madison's analysis, partly federal and partly national; it was not possible to
say whether the nation
or the states were sovereign, for the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
was a 'combination of both' federal and national elements. Bluntschli's approach
enabled this more accurate, mediating perspective
to be adopted.</p>
<p>If Inglis Clark had asked whether there might be some way of adapting the
concilliar federal executive of Switzerland to Australian
circumstances, Baker's
<i>Executive in a Federation</i> sought to provide an answer to this question.
In this work, Baker explained why he now favoured a federalised executive
council on
the Swiss model, and sought to show how it might be adopted in
Australia.<sup><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[83]</a></sup> The 'true line of
federation', he argued, is an 'equilibrium' between 'centralisation and
decentralisation'. This equilibrium was
maintained in the United States and
Switzerland, but distorted by a 'strong national force' in Canada and by a
'strong local force'
in Germany.<sup><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[84]</a></sup>
Baker was therefore critical of the draft constitutions that had emerged thus
far from the Conventions of 1891 and 1897-8 because,
while they maintained an
appropriate 'equilibrium' as regards the federal legislature, the notion of
executive responsibility only
to the House of Representatives was a 'radical
defect'. Following James Bryce and Alpheus Todd, he was critical of both
responsible
government&#8212;as a consolidating element&#8212;and the American
separation of powers&#8212;as a disintegrating element that weakened
governmental responsibility. On the contrary, Baker supported an executive
responsible to both houses of the legislature as embodying
the strengths and
avoiding the weaknesses of the American and the British
systems.<sup><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[85]</a></sup> He also favoured
election of the Senate in the manner decided by each state legislature in order
to place some constraint on the
gradual accretion of federal power that would be
likely, but he accepted that the direct election of Senators by the people of
each
state would be 'consistent' with 'true
Federation'.<sup><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[86]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While Baker was not entirely successful at the Convention of 1897-8, his
forceful arguments ensured that more extreme nationalist
views of others like
Isaacs and Higgins did not prevail either. In particular, while in principle the
Convention finally came down
on the side of responsible government, the
hesitations of Baker, John Gordon, John Alexander Cockburn and others produced
the compromise
over the powers of the Senate contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[87]</a></sup></p>

Quick and Robert Randolph Garran</b></h3>
<p>Dicey, it has been noted, had a considerable influence on the Australian
framers. A young Robert Garran, writing <i>The Coming Commonwealth</i> in 1897,
came substantially under Dicey's spell, as had John Quick in his earlier
<i>Digest of Federal Constitutions</i> of
1896.<sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[88]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In these early works, both Quick and Garran argued that federalism aims to
reconcile 'national unity' with 'state rights', in order
to bind 'a group of
States into a Nation without destroying their individuality as States'. The
solution, echoing Dicey, is to divide
'the functions of government and the
attributes of sovereignty between a central national government and a group of
local state governments',
creating a 'two-fold sovereignty ... within the limits
of the same territory.'<sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[89]</a></sup> As
Garran put it, the 'essential characteristics' of federal government are:</p>
<blockquote>
(1) The supremacy of the Federal <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. (2) The distribution, by the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, of the powers of the Nation and the States respectively. (3) The
existence of some judicial or other body empowered to act as 'guardian'
or
'interpreter' of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.<sup><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[90]</a></sup>  </blockquote><p>A
system of judicial review is accordingly necessary, against the continental
tendency to treat such matters as merely 'administrative'.
In the absence of
judicial review, 'the superior sanctity of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> is ineffectually
guarded' in Switzerland, thought
Garran.<sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[91]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1901, Quick and Garran published their magisterial <i>Annotated
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[92]</a></sup> Combining
impressive erudition and a 'sufficiently detached view of the history and
drafting' of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>,<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[93]</a></sup> Quick and
Garran authoritatively recounted the making of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>,
explaining its key concepts and glossing its specific provisions. When
discussing topics such as 'The People', 'Federal Commonwealth',
'Commonwealth',
'Sovereignty', 'States' and 'The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>', they canvassed a variety of
viewpoints, reproducing substantial excerpts from a wide range of learned
writers.<sup><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[94]</a></sup> </p>
<p>However, Quick and Garran were active participants in the debate over the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, and their commitments affected their commentary. While they
cited a range of authors, they usually favoured the nationalist interpretations
of John W Burgess. It was only in spite of this bias that their historical
account of the making of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> quite accurately recounted what
Madison would have identified as the genuinely 'federal' formative processes by
which the Australian
federation came into being. The <i>Annotated
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> as a consequence neatly embodied an unresolved tension between
the strictly compactual and nationalist conceptions of federalism.</p>
<p>Quick and Garran placed the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>into the context
of the colonies and confederations of history. They began with the 'freedom' of
Greek city-states, which they compared
to the more subordinate Roman
<i>coloni&aelig;</i>. The Greek cities were 'autonomous political communities',
'free and sovereign commonwealths' enjoying 'unfettered right[s] of
self-government'.
But while autonomous in principle, they occasionally formed
leagues which resembled 'something like' federal
unions.<sup><a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[95]</a></sup> Quick and Garran also
discussed modern European colonisation. They contrasted the 'unspeakable
outrages' and 'unutterable ruin' spread
by Spanish, Portuguese and French
colonisation, with the 'charters of freedom' and germs of 'representative
self-government' carried
by English colonists, particularly to North
America.<sup><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[96]</a></sup> However, Quick and
Garran's emphasis was on the charters <i>granted</i> to the colonies; they
overlooked the <i>autochthonous</i> covenants by which the American colonists
asserted a self-constituting capacity to form independent bodies politic and
ecclesiastic.<sup><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[97]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Quick and Garran appreciated the corporate dimensions of representative
government. Echoing Freeman, they observed that the House
of Commons derived its
name from the term <i>communitates</i> and that the representative system had
been constructed out of the self-governing towns, hundreds, and shires of
England. However,
Quick and Garran also noted that the 'reform' of
malapportioned electorates in the nineteenth century had introduced an
individualistic
conception of
representation.<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[98]</a></sup></p>
<p>In one sense, the underlying tension in Quick and Garran's thought lay
between the principles of Imperial sovereignty and autonomous
self-government.<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[99]</a></sup> Quick had
said that a 'political federation' was a 'permanent union' of 'political
communities' which nevertheless preserved their
'local independence, local
self-government and internal
sovereignty'.<sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[100]</a></sup> Yet Quick and
Garran often placed the emphasis on the authority of the Imperial Parliament and
interpreted the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> in that light. </p>
<p>A second tension in Quick and Garran concerned the compactual and national
conceptions of federalism. Their familiarity with the process
by which the
Australian federation had been formed drew them towards the first approach,
while their theoretical commitments drew
them in the opposite direction.
Scholars such as Bryce and Freeman, in their historical orientation, partially
reinforced the former
tendency, but Dicey and particularly Burgess had the
decisive influence. This is especially seen in Quick and Garran's discussion
of
sovereignty and federalism; it is also reflected in their comments on a number
of substantive provisions in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. </p>
<p>Explicitly following Austin, Dicey and Burgess, Quick and Garran held that a
'clear conception of the meaning of "sovereignty" is
the key to all political
science', and that 'true political science seems to point to the conclusion that
sovereignty is incapable
of legal limitation'. Sovereignty, they said, is the
'most essential attribute of a State&#8212;that is, of an independent political
community.'<sup><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[101]</a></sup> It is that
'original, absolute, unlimited, universal power over the individual subject and
over all associations of
subjects.'<sup><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[102]</a></sup> The sovereign is
that 'person, or determinate body of persons' which possesses such
power.<sup><a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[103]</a></sup> It is the 'supreme
organic unity', the 'ultimate legislative organ', whether it be the British
Parliament or the body of electors
under the <i>American</i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
'organised under the Constitutional provision for the amendment of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'.<sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[104]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Thus when discussing the recital in the Preamble to the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> that the people of the colonies had agreed to unite, Quick and
Garran noted that it was the <i>Enabling
Acts</i><sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[105]</a></sup> passed in several of
the Australian colonies that in fact provided for the 'popular' process of the
referendum held in each colony&#8212;features
that Madison would have called
'federal' in character. However, Quick and Garran traced the idea of the
'sovereignty' of the people
to the specifically nationalistic interpretation of
James Wilson, who affirmed that 'there is, and of necessity must be, a supreme
absolute and uncontrollable authority', and that it resides in 'the
people'.<sup><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[106]</a></sup> Quick and Garran
elided the fact that a nationalistic conception of sovereignty was inconsistent
with the actual role of the colonial
legislatures in setting up referendum
processes in each colony. </p>
<p>The amendment process under s 128 of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>(as
well as art V of the United States <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>) posed a further problem
for the nationalist interpretation. Under both schemes, the representation of
the people of a state in the
federal legislature cannot be altered without their
specific consent. Can a determinate sovereign be identified in such a context?
Austin engaged in extended verbal gymnastics to identify one, whereas Burgess
and Willoughby simply held that any purported limitation
on the power of the
nation could be disregarded as inconsistent with its sovereignty&#8212;and Quick
and Garran seemed to agree.<sup><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[107]</a></sup>
However, revealing the tension in their thought, they recognised that the 'legal
organisation and structure' of a 'sovereign' institution
may in practical terms
restrain the exercise of its
powers.<sup><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[108]</a></sup> In this respect they
differed from Burgess and Willoughby, who had rejected all such restraints.
Perhaps Quick and Garran's intimate
involvement in the drafting of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a>, or
perhaps their recognition of the ultimate sovereignty of the Imperial
Parliament, led them to recognize the effectiveness of
the fifth paragraph of
that section.</p>
<p>This was Quick and Garran's approach to sovereignty. What was their approach
to federalism? In an important discussion of the idea
of a 'Federal
Commonwealth', they began by observing that the federal idea 'pervades and
largely dominates the structure of the newly-created
community, its
parliamentary executive and judiciary departments.' But just what was this
'federal idea'? In the words 'shall be
united', they found an unambiguous
indication that the federation was 'neither a loose confederacy nor a complete
unification, but
a union of the people considered as citizens of various
communities whose individuality remains unimpaired'. The Australian Commonwealth
was clearly a federation, a <i>Bundesstaat</i> or composite
state.<sup><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[109]</a></sup> On 'indissolubility',
they forcefully drew attention to the 'disastrous doctrines of nullification and
secession' advanced by Jefferson,
Hayne and Calhoun, on the 'fatal and
insidious' basis that the American Union 'was merely a compact among the
States'.<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[110]</a></sup> Against this, Quick
and Garran understood federation to be based on a constitution, rather than a
treaty, adopting Story's
interpretation.<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[111]</a></sup> Did this mean
that Quick and Garran fully adopted the nationalist position, that the
federation was based on the consent of the people
as a whole? </p>
<p>When discussing the idea of a Federal Commonwealth, Quick and Garran
systematically used Madison's analysis in <i>Federalist No 39</i> to identify
the national and federal features of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>,
specifically in its formative, representative and amendment aspects. This much
would suggest that they were likely to adopt an accurate
and mediating view of
Australian federalism and to avoid the extremes indicated by the compactual and
national approaches. However,
they were also influenced by Burgess, and
distinguished between a 'union of states' and a 'federal state'. As to the
former:</p>
<blockquote>
The primary and fundamental meaning of a federation (from the Latin
<i>f&#339;dus</i>, a league, a treaty, a compact; akin to <i>fides</i>, faith)
is its capacity and intention to link together a number of co-equal societies or
States, so as to form one common political
system and to regulate and
co-ordinate their relations to one
another.<sup><a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[112]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Moreover,
as to the 'federal state':</p>
<blockquote>
the word 'federal' is applied to the composite state, or political community,
formed by a federal union of States. It thus describes,
not the bond of union
between the federating States, but the new State resulting from that bond. It
implies that the union has created
a new State, without destroying the old
States; that the duality is in the essence of the State itself that there is a
divided sovereignty,
and a double citizenship. This is the sense in which
Freeman, Dicey and Bryce speak of a 'Federal State'; and it is the sense in
which the phrase 'a Federal Commonwealth' is used in this section and in the
preamble [of the Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>].<sup><a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[113]</a></sup></blockquote><p>However,
following Burgess:</p>
<blockquote>
In recent years it has been argued that the word 'federal' is inappropriately
and inexactly used when applied to a State or community;
that there is no such
thing as a federal State; that if there is a State at all it must be a national
State; that anything short
of the principal attribute of statehood and
nationhood, viz: sovereignty, is a mere Confederacy; and that 'federal' can only
be legitimately
used as descriptive of the partition and distribution of powers
which is peculiar to a federal system. Federal, it is said, is properly
applied
to denote a dual but co-ordinate system of government, under one <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
and subject to a common
sovereignty.<sup><a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[114]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
these definitions, we meet with a series of important distinctions. The first
definition of 'federation' is compactual: it focuses
on the formative process.
The second definition is more Diceyan: it is concerned with the product or
outcome of that process, a 'division
of powers'. The third definition is much
more strongly nationalist: it totally rejects any necessary connection between
the formative
process and the outcome. It insists on a unitary sovereignty and
drives a rigid dichotomy between federation and confederation, defining
federation solely by reference to the division of powers. </p>
<p>Quick and Garran were caught in the tension between these definitions. They
accepted the standard distinction between federation and
confederation in terms
of the criteria already noted: co-ordinate federal and state governments having
executive power over
individuals.<sup><a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[115]</a></sup> But they were
diffident in their use of Madison's categories of 'national' and 'federal',
using them first in terms of the formative
conception, and secondly in terms of
Burgess's idea of sovereignty. </p>
<p>Quick and Garran were certainly aware of these tensions. They recognised with
Bryce that 'America is a Commonwealth of commonwealths',
a State which is
composed of other States essential to its
existence.<sup><a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[116]</a></sup> But on the other
hand, Dicey had understood the federal state to be a 'contrivance intended to
reconcile national unity and power
with the maintenance of State
rights',<sup><a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[117]</a></sup> and Burgess had
completely rejected Bryce's idea: a 'federation is merely a dual system of
government under a common
sovereignty.'<sup><a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[118]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While expressing a preference for Burgess's more 'recent' approach, Quick and
Garran had to recognize important compactual dimensions,
just as Madison's
analysis had drawn attention to the ratification by the people of the several
states. Quick and Garran's care in
doing justice to the institutional complexity
is seen in the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
The combined operation of the federal and national principles of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> is illustrated in the manner in which it was prepared, viz., by a
Convention in which the people of each colony were equally represented;
and in
the method by which it was afterwards submitted to the people of each colony for
ratification or rejection. The Federal Convention
was not a body composed of
delegates elected by the people of Australia, as individuals, forming one entire
community. ... On the
other hand, there is, in part, a recognition of the
national principle, by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> being founded on the will of the people,
and not on the mandate of the provincial
legislatures.<sup><a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[119]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Following
Wilson, they believed that the 'will of the people' was 'suggestive of a
consolidating and nationalising
tendency.'<sup><a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[120]</a></sup> But following
Madison, they also noted the 'conspicuous' fact that the people voted as
'provincial voters, a majority being required
in each colony to carry the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> in that colony'.<sup><a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[121]</a></sup>
Quick and Garran were conscious of the control over the process of drafting and
ratification exercised by the colonial legislatures,
noting that artificial
statutory majorities had been required by some. The federation was therefore a
union of states as 'corporate'
entities; but it was also a union 'of people'.
</p>
<p>These facts could not easily be accommodated to Burgess's radically
nationalistic definition of federalism. While Quick and Garran
were otherwise
exhaustive in their analysis of the federal and national features of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, the telling omission was that they did not attempt a
nationalistic explanation of the formative process; its very nature precluded
it. The nationalistic approach thus forcefully testified to its own inadequacy
as an explanatory theory, particularly when it came
to the foundation of the
system.<sup><a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[122]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following Madison, Quick and Garran also understood the representative
structures of the Australian Commonwealth to be partly national
and partly
federal, and understood these federal aspects of the representative structure to
be derived from the formative basis of
the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[123]</a></sup> Having
concluded that 'there was an expression of popular suffrage and State sanction
united in the method in which the adoption
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was
secured', in relation to the representative structure they pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
The Commonwealth as a political society has been created by the union of the
States and the people thereof. That the States are united
is proved by the words
in clause 6, which provide that the States are 'parts of the Commonwealth'; that
they are welded into the
very structure and essence of the Commonwealth ... This
is a federal feature which peculiarly illustrates the original and primary
meaning of the term, as importing a corporate union. ...<br>
As the Commonwealth itself is partly federal and partly national in its
structure, so also is its central legislative organ the Parliament.
Each
original State is equally represented in the Senate ... The Senate derives its
power from the States, as political and co-ordinate
societies, represented
according to the rule of equality ... In this manner the States become
interwoven and inwrought into the very
essence and substance of the
Commonwealth, constituting the corporate units of the
partnership.<sup><a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[124]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Despite
these very important acknowledgments of the Madisonian analysis, Quick and
Garran concluded&#8212;on balance, it seems&#8212;that
the 'true ideal of
federalism', or at least the 'drift of the development of the American
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>', was as described by
Burgess.<sup><a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[125]</a></sup> However, instead of
invoking Burgess's idea of the sovereignty of the nation-state, Quick and Garran
pointed to the overarching 'sovereignty'
of the Parliament at Westminster. Thus,
in the last pages of their commentary, they observed that the Imperial
Parliament might choose
to overrule the special guarantees of the territorial
and representational integrity of the states in the fifth paragraph of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128.</a>
They concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
[M]any profound political thinkers are of opinion that federalism ... is but a
transitory form of government, midway between the
condition of confederacy and
that of a single sovereignty over a combined population and
territory.<sup><a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[126]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Why
did they adopt this conclusion? While it is not possible to be certain, it
appears that they accepted a rigid dichotomy between
the compactual and national
definitions of federalism and&#8212;even though neither account could fully
account for the facts&#8212;they
simply opted for one over the other. They were
also attracted to this approach because it accorded with 'the more modern scope
of
the word'.<sup><a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[127]</a></sup> Moreover, they
treated the unitary sovereignty of the Imperial Parliament as the key
integrating factor.<sup><a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[128]</a></sup> It may
be, as their discussion of 'the evolution of nationalism'
shows,<sup><a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[129]</a></sup> that Quick and Garran
were also drawn to Burgess for pragmatic reasons: the national powers of the
American federation had waxed
since the Civil War. But while the general course
of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has certainly been in that direction,
in our day, the prospects of the nation-state are not so clear-cut. </p>

Isaacs and Henry Bournes Higgins</b></h3>
<p>If Quick and Garran felt the tension between compact and nation, the
nationalistic interpretation of federalism found its most complete
expression in
the views of Isaac Isaacs and Henry Bournes
Higgins.<sup><a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[130]</a></sup> Figures such as
these insisted that theirs was the 'true
federalism'.<sup><a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[131]</a></sup> For Higgins it
began with an insistence, following John Locke, that the body politic is
essentially unitary in nature and that in
'practical' terms, 'sovereignty' ought
to rest with 'the Australian people'. As a consequence, equality of
representation in the
Senate was not an 'essential' of federation; it had
actually created an 'entrenched oligarchy' in the United
States.<sup><a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[132]</a></sup> Furthermore, the
American <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was too difficult to amend, and the Australian
Commonwealth Bill suffered from the same
defects.<sup><a name="fnB134" href="#fn134">[133]</a></sup> Rather, the
'essential' feature of federation is the division of
powers.<sup><a name="fnB135" href="#fn135">[134]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The similarities with the views of Dicey and especially Burgess are quite
evident, but Higgins may have been a little hesitant to
rely explicitly on these
authors on account of their relatively liberal-conservative
views.<sup><a name="fnB136" href="#fn136">[135]</a></sup> By contrast, Isaacs
was very ready to rely on Dicey and Burgess when their views accorded with his
own. Following Burgess and Dicey,
he held that the essential principle of
federalism is the division of powers, not equality of
representation.<sup><a name="fnB137" href="#fn137">[136]</a></sup> On the
question of constitutional amendment, he also followed Burgess, arguing for a
relatively easy, national-majoritarian means
of constitutional alteration in
order to avoid an eventual
'stagnation'.<sup><a name="fnB138" href="#fn138">[137]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In this connection, it is interesting to note that in the <i>Engineers
Case</i>,<sup><a name="fnB139" href="#fn139">[138]</a></sup> one of Justice
Isaacs's central premises was that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was 'the political
compact of the <i>whole of the people of Australia</i>, enacted into binding law
by the Imperial Parliament'&#8212;specifically rejecting the more compactual
approaches adopted by Griffith
CJ and Barton and O'Connor JJ in previous
decisions.<sup><a name="fnB140" href="#fn140">[139]</a></sup> In <i>Australian
Democracy and Our Constitutional System</i> (1939), Isaacs repeated his
national&#8211;majoritarian interpretation of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>
and called for an expansion of Commonwealth legislative
powers.<sup><a name="fnB141" href="#fn141">[140]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the 1890s, however, the question was whether Higgins's and Isaacs's
nationalist views would prevail against the replies of those
like Inglis Clark,
who insisted that 'each State is a separately organised community which has a
distinct collective and corporate
life and distinct interests', requiring
separate representation of the people thereof in the federal Parliament and a
distinct say
in the amendment
procedure.<sup><a name="fnB142" href="#fn142">[141]</a></sup> Madison's analysis
of the American <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> suggested that at the foundation of the
federation was a 'federal' process whereby, as the Preamble to the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> would declare, the peoples of several independent colonies
separately agreed to unite in a federal commonwealth. This origin of the
federation was, contrary to Burgess's abstract, nationalistic conception,
premised on the capacity of the representatives of those
colonies to negotiate
and agree on the terms of a federal union. A majority of those representatives
understandably used that capacity
to create a federation that was, like
Madison's own, a composition of both federal and national elements. </p>

<p>This article has been centrally concerned with the third of three related
questions: What were the sources upon which the Australian
framers relied for
their ideas about federalism? What accounts of federalism did these sources
convey to the Australians? And how
did the Australians appropriate and interpret
these accounts? </p>
<p>The nationalistic writings of Burgess insisted on the consolidated nature of
the sovereign nation-state and defined the 'federal state'
as a unitary state
with a 'dual system of government under a <i>common</i> sovereignty'. It was a
view that dovetailed with Dicey's legalistic focus on the 'division of powers'
between two 'spheres' of government,
presided over by a supreme judiciary.
Australians who held to similarly nationalistic points of view, such as Isaacs
and Higgins,
and to a lesser extent, Quick and Garran, were understandably drawn
to such theories of federalism, and adopted many of Burgess's
and Dicey's
arguments and analyses. </p>
<p>However, Dicey and Burgess were not the only sources of ideas about
federalism, and their effect on Isaacs, Higgins, Quick and Garran
is not
representative of their influence on the framers as a whole. Other Australians,
such as Just, Inglis Clark and Baker, drew
more substantially on writers like
Madison, Bryce and Freeman&#8212;writers who described the historical origins,
theoretical development
and institutional details of the American federation in
a way that demonstrated the 'partly national, partly federal' nature of the
system. </p>
<p>In particular, Madison's <i>Federalist No 39</i>, although
rhetorically-motivated, was very strictly empirical and precise. Madison
carefully analysed the formation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, its representative
institutions, the operation of federal power, the allocation of powers and the
amendment of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. And in identifying both 'federal' and
'national' features embedded in each aspect, he drew attention to important
analytical relationships
between them. For just as the federal legislature was
partly federal and partly national, so the amendment procedure contained both
federal and national elements. It was but a small step for Madison's readers to
conclude that there might be some kind of 'necessary'
relationship involved:
that an 'ideal' federation 'ought' somehow to embody both federal and national
aspects in the way that Madison
had described. </p>
<p>Thus for Thomas Just, the circumstances in which the American
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was framed were those that should also characterise the
formation of the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. The implication was that
federation should be 'federal' as to its foundation (a unanimous agreement of
the constituent states),<sup><a name="fnB143" href="#fn143">[142]</a></sup> and
'partly federal, partly national' as to its representative institutions and
amending formula. Accordingly, leading figures in
the Australian federal
conventions, such as Edmund Barton, Bernhard Wise and Alexander Cockburn,
explicitly adopted this reasoning
when discussing the composition of the
Senate.<sup><a name="fnB144" href="#fn144">[143]</a></sup> Likewise, when
debating the composition of the federal legislature, the framers regularly
reasoned in terms of the formative basis
of the proposed federation, and when
debating the amendment formula, similarly reasoned in terms of both the
formative basis of,
and the representative institutions to be adopted under, the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB145" href="#fn145">[144]</a></sup> The
result, as Harrison Moore pointed out, was a federal commonwealth that was:</p>
<blockquote>
founded on the assumed continuance of [the existing political] communities in
the distribution of powers between the Commonwealth
and the States, in the
organisation of the Commonwealth Government, and in the machinery for the
alteration of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.<sup><a name="fnB146" href="#fn146">[145]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>Madison had showed that the American <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> had
both federal and national elements. The <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>&#8212;subject to the overarching role of the Imperial
Parliament and the institution of responsible government&#8212;was to follow
a
very similar course. This was partly because the <i>practical, institutional
conditions</i> under which the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> came into being
were analogous to the process by which the American <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> had been
formed. It was also because <i>theoretical reflection</i> on the American system
suggested that such processes and outcomes were essential to the idea of a 'true
federation'. </p>
<p>Madison's was not the only approach to federalism that influenced the
Australian framers. However, the various theoretical approaches
had to be
accommodated to the institutional processes by which the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was, in fact, formed. All of this suggests that Madison's
analysis, adapted to the context of responsible government and Imperial
subordination in Australia, was not only a key influence on the Australian
framers, it provides the most empirically accurate basis
upon which to
understand the nature of the 'federal commonwealth' embodied in the
<i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.</p>

Burgess, above n 39. Thus the two 'tensions' in their thought noted earlier may
well have been resolved in their
commitment to Imperial sovereignty. At ibid
380, having said that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> derives from the ultimate
sovereignty of the Imperial Parliament, they remarked that the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> partitions 'the totality of <i>quasi</i>&#8211;sovereign
powers delegated to the Commonwealth, as well as providing for a future
development and expansion of those powers.'

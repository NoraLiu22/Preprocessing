          <h1>Confucius and the "Confucian Tradition"&#42;</h1>
                    <p>Confucianism is perhaps the most well-known of the textual traditions in China. <a href="../irc/classics.htm">  The classical Confucian texts became key to the orthodox state ideology of the Chinese dynasties,</a> and these texts, though they were mastered only by a scholarly elite, in fact penetrated society  deeply. </p>

           <p>Through the interpretation of the  scholar Dong Zhongshu, who lived  during the Han dynasty from around 179-104 BCE, Confucianism became strongly linked to the cosmic framework of traditional Chinese thought, as the Confucian ideals of ritual and social hierarchy came to be elaborated in terms of <a href="../bgov/cosmos.htm#yinyang">cosmic principles such as <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>.</a> </p>
          <h2>WHO WAS CONFUCIUS?</h2>
                     <p>The myth of origins told by proponents of Confucianism (and by plenty of modern historians) begins with <b>Confucius</b>, whose Chinese name was <b>Kong Qiu</b> and who lived from 551 to 479 BCE. Judging from the little direct evidence that still survives, however, it appears that Kong Qiu did not view himself as the founder of a school of thought, much less as the originator of anything. The portrayal of Kong Qiu as originary and the coalescence of a self-conscious identity among people tracing their heritage back to him took place long after his death. [See <a href="#emergence"><i>The Emergence of &ldquo;Confucianism&rdquo; during the Han Dynasty</i></a> below.] <a name="teach">&nbsp;</a></p>
           <h2>WHAT DID CONFUCIUS TEACH?</h2>
           <p><b>What does emerge from the earliest layers of the written record is that Kong Qiu sought a revival of the ideas and institutions of a past golden age. </b>Kong Qiu transmitted not only specific rituals and values but also a hierarchical social structure and the weight of the past. Employed in a minor government position as a specialist in the governmental and family rituals of his native state, Kong Qiu hoped to disseminate knowledge of the rites and inspire their universal performance.</p>
           <p><span class="green"><i>The Ideal Ruler</i>. </span>That kind of broad-scale transformation could take place, he thought, only with the active encouragement of responsible rulers. The ideal ruler, as exemplified by the legendary sage-kings Yao and Shun or the adviser to the Zhou rulers, the Duke of Zhou, exercises ethical suasion, the ability to influence others by the power of his moral example. To the virtues of the ruler correspond values that each individual is supposed to cultivate: 1) benevolence toward others; 2) a general sense of doing what is right; and 3) loyalty and diligence in serving one&rsquo;s superiors.</p>
           <p> <i class="green">Ritual (Li).</i> Universal moral ideals are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the restoration of civilization. Society also needs what Kong Qiu calls <i>li</i>, roughly translated as &ldquo;ritual.&rdquo; Although people are supposed to develop propriety or the ability to act appropriately in any given social situation (another sense of the same word, <i>li</i>), still the specific rituals people are supposed to perform (also <i>li</i>) vary considerably, depending on age, social status, gender, and context. In family ritual, for instance, rites of mourning depend on one&rsquo;s kinship relation to the deceased. In international affairs, degrees of pomp, as measured by ornateness of dress and opulence of gifts, depend on the rank of the foreign emissary. Offerings to the gods are also highly regulated: the sacrifices of each social class are restricted to specific classes of deities, and a clear hierarchy prevails.<a name="emergence">&nbsp; </a></p>
           <h2>THE EMERGENCE OF &ldquo;CONFUCIANISM&rdquo; DURING THE HAN DYNASTY</h2>
           <p> It was only with the founding of the Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE) that Confucianism became &ldquo;Confucianism,&rdquo; that the ideas associated with Kong Qiu&rsquo;s name received state support and were disseminated generally throughout upper-class society. The creation of Confucianism was neither simple nor sudden, as the following three examples will make clear.</p>
          <p><span class="green"><i>1. The Classical Texts</i>. </span>In the year 136 BCE the classical writings touted by Confucian scholars were made the foundation of the official system of education and scholarship, to the exclusion of titles supported by other philosophers. <b>The five classics </b>(or five scriptures, <i>wujing</i>) were the <i><b>Classic of Poetry</b></i> (<i>Shijing</i>), <i><b>Classic of History</b></i> (<i>Shujing</i>), <i><b>Classic of Changes</b></i> (<i>Yijing</i>), <i><b>Record of Rites</b></i> (<i>Liji</i>), and  <i><b>Chronicles of the Spring and Autumn Period</b></i> (<i>Chunqiu</i>) with the <i><b>Zuo Commentary</b></i> (<i>Zuozhuan</i>), most of which had existed prior to the time of Kong Qiu.<a href="#fn" class="caption_green">(1)</a> Although Kong Qiu was commonly believed to have written or edited some of the five classics, his own statements (collected in the <i><b>Analects </b></i>[<i>Lunyu</i>]) and the writings of his closest followers were not yet admitted into the canon.<b></b></p>
          <p><span class="green"><i>2. State Sponsorship</i>. </span>Kong Qiu&rsquo;s name was implicated more directly in the second example of the Confucian system, the state-sponsored cult that erected temples in his honor throughout the empire and that provided monetary support for turning his ancestral home into a national shrine. Members of the literate elite visited such temples, paying formalized respect and enacting rituals in front of spirit tablets of the master and his disciples. </p>
          <p><span class="green"><i>3. Dong Zhongshu&rsquo;s Cosmological Framework</i>. </span>The third example is the corpus of writing left by the scholar Dong Zhongshu (ca. 179-104 BCE), who was instrumental in promoting Confucian ideas and books in official circles. Dong was recognized by the government as the leading spokesman for the scholarly elite. His theories provided an overarching cosmological framework for Kong Qiu&rsquo;s ideals, sometimes adding ideas unknown in Kong Qiu&rsquo;s time, sometimes making more explicit or providing a particular interpretation of what was already stated in Kong Qiu&rsquo;s work. </p>
          <p>Dong drew heavily on concepts of earlier thinkers &mdash; few of whom were self-avowed Confucians &mdash; to explain the workings of the cosmos. He used the concepts of <i>yin </i>and <i>yang </i>to explain how change followed a knowable pattern, and he elaborated on the role of the ruler as one who connected the realms of Heaven, Earth, and humans. The social hierarchy implicit in Kong Qiu&rsquo;s ideal world was coterminous, thought Dong, with a division of all natural relationships into a superior and inferior member. Dong&rsquo;s theories proved determinative for the political culture of Confucianism during the Han and later dynasties. </p>
          <p> <b>What in all of the examples above, we need to ask, was Confucian? Or, more precisely, what kind of thing is the &ldquo;Confucianism&rdquo; in each of these examples?</b> <b>In the case of the five classics, &ldquo;Confucianism&rdquo; amounts to a set of books that were mostly written before Kong Qiu lived</b> but that later tradition associates with his name. It is a curriculum instituted by the emperor for use in the most prestigious institutions of learning. <b>In the case of the state cult<i>, </i> &ldquo;Confucianism&rdquo; is a complex ritual apparatus,</b> an empire-wide network of shrines patronized by government authorities. It depends upon the ability of the government to maintain religious institutions throughout the empire and upon the willingness of state officials to engage regularly in worship. <b>In the case of the work of Dong Zhongshu, &ldquo;Confucianism&rdquo; is a conceptual scheme,</b> a fluid synthesis of some of Kong Qiu&rsquo;s ideals and the various cosmologies popular well after Kong Qiu lived. Rather than being an updating of something universally acknowledged as Kong Qiu&rsquo;s philosophy, it is a conscious systematizing, under the symbol of Kong Qiu, of ideas current in the Han dynasty.<a name="genealogy">&nbsp;</a> </p>
          <h2>GENEALOGY OF THE &ldquo;CONFUCIAN TRADITION&rdquo; AND WHAT IT REVEALS</h2>
          <p>If even during the Han dynasty the term &ldquo;Confucianism&rdquo; covers so many different sorts of things &mdash; books, a ritual apparatus, a conceptual scheme &mdash; one might well wonder why we persist in using one single word to cover such a broad range of phenomena. Sorting out the pieces of that puzzle is now one of the most pressing tasks in the study of Chinese history, which is already beginning to replace the wooden division of the Chinese intellectual world into the three teachings &mdash; each in turn marked by phases called &ldquo;proto-,&rdquo; &ldquo;neo-,&rdquo; or &ldquo;revival of&rdquo; &mdash; with a more critical and nuanced understanding of how traditions are made and sustained.</p>
          <p>It is instructive to observe how the word &ldquo;Confucianism&rdquo; came to be applied to all of these things and more.<a href="#fn" class="caption_green">(2)</a> As a word, &ldquo;Confucianism&rdquo; is tied to the Latin name, &ldquo;Confucius,&rdquo; which originated not with Chinese philosophers but with European missionaries in the sixteenth century. Committed to winning over the top echelons of Chinese society, Jesuits and other Catholic orders subscribed to the version of Chinese religious history supplied to them by the educated elite. The story they told was that their teaching began with Kong Qiu, who was referred to as Kongfuzi, rendered into Latin as &ldquo;Confucius.&rdquo; It was elaborated by Mengzi (rendered as &ldquo;Mencius&rdquo;) and Xunzi and was given official recognition &mdash; as if it had existed as the same entity, unmodified for several hundred years &mdash; under the Han dynasty. The teaching changed to the status of an unachieved metaphysical principle during the centuries that Buddhism was believed to have been dominant and was resuscitated &mdash; still basically unchanged &mdash; only with the teachings of Zhou Dunyi (1017- 1073), Zhang Zai (1020), Cheng Hao (1032-1085), and Cheng Yi (1033- 1107), and the commentaries authored by Zhu Xi (1130-1200).</p>
          <p>As a genealogy crucial to the self-definition of modern Confucianism, that myth of origins is both misleading and instructive. It lumps together heterogeneous ideas, books that predate Kong Qiu, and a state-supported cult under the same heading. It denies the diversity of names by which members of a supposedly unitary tradition chose to call themselves, including <i>ru</i> (the early meaning of which remains disputed, usually translated as &ldquo;scholars&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confucians&rdquo;), <i>daoxue</i> (study of the Way), <i>lixue</i> (study of principle), and <i>xinxue</i> (study of the mind). It ignores the long history of contention over interpreting Kong Qiu and overlooks the debt owed by later thinkers like Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming (1472-1529) to Buddhist notions of the mind and practices of meditation and to Daoist ideas of change. And it passes over in silence the role played by non-Chinese regimes in making Confucianism into an orthodoxy, as in the year 1315, when the Mongol government required that the writings of Kong Qiu and his early followers, redacted and interpreted through the commentaries of Zhu Xi, <a href="../irc/classics.htm">become the basis for the national civil service examination</a>.</p>
          <p>At the same time, Confucianism&rsquo;s story about itself reveals much. It names the figures, books, and slogans of the past that recent Confucians have found most inspiring. As a string of ideals, it illuminates what its proponents wish it to be. As a lineage, it imagines a line of descent kept pure from the traditions of Daoism and Buddhism. The construction of the latter two teachings involves a similar process. Their histories do not simply move from the past to the present; they are also projected backward from specific presents to significant pasts.<a name="fn">&nbsp;</a> </p>

<h3>Autonomic Nervous System</h3>

The <strong>autonomic nervous system (ANS)</strong> regulates the 
functions of our internal organs (the viscera) such as the heart, 
stomach and intestines.  The ANS is part of the peripheral nervous system 
and it also controls some of the muscles within the body.  We are often 
unaware of the ANS because it functions involuntary and reflexively.  For 
example, we do not notice when blood vessels change size or when our heart 
beats faster. However, some people can be trained to control some 
functions of the ANS such as heart rate or blood pressure.  </p>

<p><img src="gif/runner.gif" alt="runner" class="flr" />
<img src="gif/zzz.gif" alt="sleeper" class="flr" />
The ANS is most important in two situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>In emergencies that cause stress and require us to <strong>
"fight" or take "flight"</strong> (run away)</li> 
<li>In nonemergencies that allow us to <strong>"rest" and
"digest."</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The ANS regulates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscles</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="gif/vis1.gif" alt="vis" class="flr" width="116" 
height="111" /> 
-- in the skin (around hair follicles; smooth muscle<br />
-- around blood vessels (smooth muscle)<br />
-- in the eye (the iris; smooth muscle)<br />
-- in the stomach, intestines and bladder (smooth muscle)<br />
-- of the heart (cardiac muscle)<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Glands</li>
</ul>

<p>The ANS is divided into three parts:</p> 
<ul>
<li>The sympathetic nervous system</li> 
<li>The parasympathetic nervous system</li> 
<li>The enteric nervous 
system</li>
</ul>

<table><tr><td>The Sympathetic Nervous System</td>
<td></td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="sym1.gif" alt="sympathetic nervous system" class="fl" 
/></td> <td><p>It is a nice, sunny day...you are taking a nice walk in 
the park. <img src="gif/bear.gif" alt="bear" class="flr" /> Suddenly, an 
angry bear appears in your path.  Do you stay and fight OR do you turn 
and run away?  These are "Fight or Flight" responses.  In these types of 
situations, your sympathetic nervous system is called into action - it 
uses energy - blood pressure increases, heart beats faster, and 
digestion slows.</p>

<p>Notice in the picture on the left that the sympathetic nervous system 
originates in the spinal cord.  Specifically, the cell bodies of the first 
neuron (the preganglionic neuron) are located in the thoracic and lumbar 
spinal cord.  Axons from these neurons project to a chain of ganglia 
located near the spinal cord.  In most cases, this neuron makes a <a 
href="synapse.html">synapse</a> with another neuron (post-ganglionic 
neuron) in the ganglion. A few preganglionic neurons go to other ganglia 
outside of the sympathetic chain and synapse there. The post-ganglionic 
neuron then projects to the "target" - either a muscle or a gland.</p>

<p>Two more facts about the sympathetic nervous system: the synapse in the 
sympathetic ganglion uses <strong>acetylcholine</strong> as a <a 
href="chnt1.html">neurotransmitter</a>; the synapse of the post-ganglionic 
neuron with the target organ uses the neurotransmitter called 
<strong>norepinephrine</strong>. (Of course, there is one exception:  the 
sympathetic post-ganglionic neuron that terminates on the sweat glands 
uses acetylcholine.)</p></td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>The Parasympathetic Nervous System</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="parasym1.gif" alt="parasympathetic nervous system" 
class="fl" /></td>
<td><p>It is a nice, sunny day...you are taking a nice walk in the park. 
<img src="weather1.gif" alt="weather" class="flr" />  
This time, however, you decide to relax in comfortable chair that you have
brought along.  This calls for "Rest and Digest" responses.  Now is the
time for the parasympathetic nervous to work to save energy.  This is when 
blood pressure can decrease, pulse rate can slow, and digestion can 
start.</p>

<p>Notice in the picture on the left, that the cell bodies of the 
parasympathetic nervous system are located in the spinal cord (sacral 
region) and in the <strong>medulla</strong>.  In the medulla, the <a 
href="cranial.html">cranial nerves</a> III, VII, IX and X form the 
preganglionic parasympathetic fibers.  The preganglionic fiber from the 
medulla or spinal cord projects to ganglia very close to the target 
organ and makes a synapse.  This synapse uses the neurotransmitter 
called <strong>acetylcholine</strong>. From this ganglion, the 
post-ganglionic neuron projects to the target organ and uses 
<strong>acetylcholine</strong> again at its 
terminal.</p></td></tr></table>

<p>It should be noted that the autonomic nervous system is always working. 
It is NOT only active during "fight or flight" or "rest and digest" 
situations.  Rather, the autonomic nervous system acts to maintain normal 
internal functions and works with the somatic nervous system.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://whyfiles.org/026fear/physio1.html">enteric nervous
system</a> is a third division of the autonomic nervous system that
you do not hear much about.  The enteric nervous system is a meshwork of
nerve fibers that innervate the viscera (gastrointestinal tract, pancreas,
and gall bladder).</p>

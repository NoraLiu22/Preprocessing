1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There is probably no one quality of natural objects, from which we derive so much pure and
intellectual enjoyment as from their colours. The heavenly blue of the firmament, the glowing
tints of sunset, the exquisite purity of the snowy mountains, and the endless shades of green
presented by the verdure-clad surface of the earth, are a never-failing source of pleasure to all
who enjoy the inestimable gift of sight. Yet these constitute, as it were, but the frame and
background of a marvellous and ever-changing picture. In contrast with these broad and soothing
tints, we have presented to us in the vegetable and animal worlds, an infinite variety of objects
adorned with the most beautiful and most varied hues. Flowers, insects, and birds, are the
organisms most generally ornamented in this way; and their symmetry of form, their variety of
structure, and the lavish abundance with which they clothe and enliven the earth, cause them to
be objects of universal admiration. The relation of this wealth of colour to our mental and moral
nature is indisputable. The child and the savage alike admire the gay tints of flower, bird, and
insect; while to many of us their contemplation brings a solace and enjoyment which is both
intellectually and morally beneficial. It can then hardly excite surprise that this relation was long
thought to afford a sufficient explanation of the phenomena of colour in nature; and although the
fact that--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, <br />
And waste its sweetness on the desert air--&quot;</blockquote>

<p>might seem to throw some doubt on the sufficiency of the explanation, the answer was
easy,--that in the progress of discovery, man would, sooner or later, find out and enjoy every
beauty that the hidden recesses of the earth have in store for him. This theory received great
support, from the difficulty of conceiving any other use or meaning in the colours with which so
many natural objects are adorned. Why should the homely gorse be clothed in golden raiment,
and the prickly cactus be adorned with crimson bells? Why should our fields be gay with
buttercups, and the heather-clad mountains be clad in purple robes? Why should every land
produce its own peculiar floral gems, and the alpine rocks glow with beauty, if not for the
contemplation and enjoyment of man? What could be the use to the butterfly of its gaily-painted
wings, or to the humming bird of its jewelled breast, except to add the final touches to a world-picture, calculated at once to please and to refine mankind? And even now, with all our recently
acquired knowledge of this subject, who shall say that these old-world views were not
intrinsically and fundamentally sound; and that, although we now know that colour has &quot;uses&quot; in
nature that we little dreamt of, yet the relation of those colours to our senses and emotions may
be another, and perhaps more important use which they subserve in the great system of the
universe?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	We now propose to lay before our readers a general account of the more recent discoveries
on this interesting subject; and in doing so, it will be necessary first to give an outline of the
more important facts as to the colours of organised beings; then to point out the cases in which it
has been shown that colour is of use; and lastly, to endeavour to throw some light on its nature,
and the general laws of its development.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Among naturalists, colour was long thought to be of little import, and to <font color="990000">[[p. 385]]</font> be quite
untrustworthy as a specific character. The numerous cases of variability of colour led to this
view. The occurrence of white blackbirds, white peacocks, and black leopards; of white blue-bells, and of white, blue, or pink milkworts, led to the belief that colour was essentially unstable,
that it could therefore be of little or no importance, and belonged to quite a different class of
characters from form or structure. But it now begins to be perceived that these cases, though
tolerably numerous, are, after all, exceptional; and that colour, as a rule, is a constant character.
The great majority of species, both of animals and plants, are each distinguished by peculiar tints
which vary very little, while the minutest markings are often constant in thousands or millions of
individuals. All our field buttercups are invariably yellow, and our poppies red, while many of
our butterflies and birds resemble each other in every spot and streak of colour through
thousands of individuals. We also find that colour is constant in whole genera and other groups
of species. The Genistas are all yellow, the Erythrinas all red, many genera of Carabid&aelig; are
entirely black, whole families of birds--as the Dendrocolaptid&aelig;--are brown, while among
butterflies the numerous species of Lyc&aelig;na are all more or less blue, those of Pontia white, and
those of Callidryas yellow. An extensive survey of the organic world thus leads us to the
conclusion that colour is by no means so unimportant or inconstant a character as at first sight it
appears to be; and the more we examine it the more convinced we shall become that it must serve
some purpose in nature, and that besides charming us by its diversity and beauty it must be well
worthy of our attentive study, and have many secrets to unfold to us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In order to group the great variety of facts relating to the colours of the organic world in
some intelligible way, it will be best to consider how far the chief theories already proposed will
account for them. One of the most obvious and most popular of these theories, and one which is
still held, in part at least, by many eminent naturalists, is, that colour is due to some direct action
of the heat and light of the sun, thus at once accounting for the great number of brilliant birds,
insects, and flowers, which are found between the tropics. But here we must ask whether it is
really the fact that colour is more developed in tropical than in temperate climates, in proportion
to the whole number of species; and even if we find this to be so, we have to inquire whether
there are not so many and such striking exceptions to the rule, as to indicate some other causes at
work than the direct influence of solar light and heat. As this is a most important question, we
must go into it somewhat fully.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It is undoubtedly the case that there are an immensely greater number of richly-coloured
birds and insects in tropical than in temperate and cold countries; but it is by no means so certain
that the <em>proportion</em> of coloured to obscure species is much or any greater. Naturalists and
collectors well know that the majority of tropical birds are dull-coloured; and there are whole
families, comprising hundreds of species, not one of which exhibits a particle of bright colour.
Such are the Timaliid&aelig; of the Eastern and the Dendrocolaptid&aelig; of the Western hemispheres.
Again, many groups of birds, which are universally distributed, are no more adorned with colour
in the tropical than in the temperate zone; such are Thrushes, Wrens, Goatsuckers, Hawks,
Grouse, Plovers, and Snipe; and if tropical light and heat have any direct colouring effect, it is
certainly most extraordinary that in groups so varied in form, structure, and habits as those just
mentioned, the tropical should be in no wise distinguished in this respect from the temperate
species. The brilliant tropical birds mostly belong to groups which are wholly or almost wholly
tropical--as the chatterers, toucans, <font color="990000">[[p. 386]]</font> trogons, and pittas; but as there are perhaps an
equal number of groups which are wholly dull-coloured, while others contain dull and bright-coloured species in nearly equal proportions, the evidence is by no means strong that tropical
light or heat has anything to do with the matter. But there are also groups in which the cold and
temperate zones produce finer-coloured species than the tropics. Thus the arctic ducks and divers
are handsomer than those of the tropical zone, while the King-duck of temperate America and the
Mandarin-duck of N. China are the most beautifully coloured of the whole family. In the
pheasant family we have the gorgeous gold and silver pheasants in N. China and Mongolia; and
the superb Impeyan pheasant in the temperate N. W. Himalayas, as against the peacocks and fire-backed pheasants of tropical Asia. Then we have the curious fact that most of the bright-coloured
birds of the tropics are denizens of the forests, where they are shaded from the direct light of the
sun, and that they abound near the equator where cloudy skies are very prevalent; while, on the
other hand, places where light and heat are at a maximum have often dull-coloured birds. Such
are the Sahara and other deserts where almost all the living things are sand-coloured; but the
most curious case is that of the Galapagos islands, situated under the equator, and not far from
South America where the most gorgeous colours abound, but which are yet characterised by
prevailing dull and sombre tints in birds, insects, and flowers, so that they reminded Mr. Darwin
of the cold and barren plains of Patagonia. Insects are wonderfully brilliant in tropical countries
generally, and any, one looking over a collection of South American or Malayan butterflies
would scout the idea of their being no more gaily-coloured than the average of European species,
and in this they would be undoubtedly right. But on examination we should find that all the more
brilliantly-coloured groups were exclusively tropical, and that, where a genus has a wide range,
there is little difference in coloration between the species of cold and warm countries. Thus the
European Vanessides, including the beautiful &quot;peacock,&quot; &quot;Camberwell beauty,&quot; and &quot;red
admiral&quot; butterflies, are quite up to the average of tropical beauty in the same group, and the
remark will equally apply to the little &quot;blues&quot; and &quot;coppers;&quot; while the alpine &quot;apollo&quot; butterflies
have a delicate beauty that can hardly be surpassed. In other insects, which are less directly
dependent on climate and vegetation, we find even greater anomalies. In the immense family of
the Carabid&aelig; or predaceous ground-beetles, the northern forms fully equal, if they do not
surpass, all that the tropics can produce. Everywhere, too, in hot countries, there are thousands of
obscure species of insects which, if they were all collected, would not improbably bring down
the average of colour to much about the same level as that of temperate zones.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But it is when we come to the vegetable world that the greatest misconception on this subject
prevails. In abundance and variety of floral colour the tropics are almost universally believed to
be pre-eminent, not only absolutely, but relatively to the whole mass of vegetation and the total
number of species. Twelve years of observation among the vegetation of the eastern and western
tropics has, however, convinced me that this notion is entirely erroneous, and that, in proportion
to the whole number of species of plants, those having gaily-coloured flowers are actually more
abundant in the temperate zones than between the tropics. This will be found to be not so
extravagant an assertion as it may at first appear, if we consider how many of the choicest
adornments of our greenhouses and flower-shows are really temperate as opposed to tropical
plants. The masses of colour produced by our Rhododendrons, Azaleas, and Camellias, our
Pelargoniums, <font color="990000">[[p. 387]]</font> Calceolarias, and Cinerarias,--all strictly temperate plants--can
certainly not be surpassed, if they can be equalled, by any productions of the tropics.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> But we
may go further, and say that the hardy plants of our cold temperate zone equal, if they do not
surpass, the productions of the tropics. Let us only remember such gorgeous tribes of flowers as
the Roses, Peonies, Hollyhocks, and Antirrhinums, the Laburnum, Wistaria, and Lilac; the Lilies,
Irises, and Tulips, the Hyacinths, Anemones, Gentians, and Poppies, and even our humble Gorse,
Broom, and Heather; and we may defy any tropical country to produce masses of floral colour in
greater abundance and variety. It may be true that individual tropical shrubs and flowers do
surpass everything in the rest of the world, but that is to be expected, because the tropical zone
comprises a much greater land-area than the two temperate zones, while, owing to its more
favourable climate, it produces a still larger proportion of species of plants, and a great number
of peculiar natural orders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Direct observation in tropical forests, plains, and mountains, fully supports this view.
Occasionally we are startled by some gorgeous mass of colour, but as a rule we gaze upon an
endless expanse of green foliage, only here and there enlivened by not very conspicuous flowers.
Even the orchids, whose gorgeous blossoms adorn our stoves, form no exception to this rule. It is
only in favoured spots that we find them in abundance; the species with small and inconspicuous
flowers greatly preponderate; and the flowering season of each kind being of short duration, they
rarely produce any marked effect of colour amid the vast masses of foliage which surround them.
An experienced collector in the Eastern tropics once told me, that although a single mountain in
Java had produced three hundred species of Orchide&aelig;, only about 2 per cent. of the whole were
sufficiently ornamental or showy to be worth sending home as a commercial speculation. The
alpine meadows and rock-slopes, the open plains of the Cape of Good Hope or of Australia, and
the flower-prairies of North America, offer an amount and variety of floral colour which can
certainly not be surpassed, even if it can be equalled, between the tropics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It appears, therefore, that we may dismiss the theory that the development of colour in nature
is directly dependent on, and in any way proportioned to the amount of solar heat and light, as
entirely unsupported by facts. Strange to say, however, there are some rare and little-known
phenomena, which prove that, in exceptional cases, light does directly affect the colours of
natural objects, and it will be as well to consider these before passing on to other matters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A few years ago Mr. T. W. Wood called attention to the curious changes in the colour of the
chrysalis of the small cabbage butterfly (<em>Pontia rap&aelig;</em>) when the caterpillars were confined <font color="990000">[[p.
388]]</font> in boxes lined with different tints. Thus in black boxes they were very dark, in white boxes
nearly white; and he further showed that similar changes occurred in a state of nature, chrysalises
fixed against a white-washed wall being nearly white, against a red brick wall reddish, against a
pitched paling nearly black. It has also been observed that the cocoon of the emperor moth is
either white or brown, according to the surrounding colours. But the most extraordinary example
of this kind of change is that furnished by the chrysalis of an African butterfly (<em>Papilio Nireus</em>),
observed at the Cape by Mrs. Barber, and described (with a coloured plate) in the <em>Transactions
of the Entomological Society</em>, 1874, p. 519. The caterpillar feeds on the orange tree, and also on a
forest tree (<em>Vepris lanceolata</em>) which has a lighter green leaf, and its colour corresponds with that
of the leaves it feeds upon, being of a darker green when it feeds on the orange. The chrysalis is
usually found suspended among the leafy twigs of its food-plant, or of some neighbouring tree;
but it is probably often attached to larger branches, and Mrs. Barber has discovered that it has the
property of acquiring the colour, more or less accurately, of any natural object it may be in
contact with. A number of the caterpillars were placed in a case with a glass cover, one side of
the case being formed by a red brick wall, the other sides being of yellowish wood. They were
fed on orange leaves, and a branch of the bottle-brush tree (<em>Banksia, sp.</em>) was also placed in the
case. When fully fed, some attached themselves to the orange twigs, others to the bottle-brush
branch; and these all changed to green pup&aelig;; but each corresponded exactly in tint to the leaves
around it, the one being dark the other a pale faded green. Another attached itself to the wood,
and the pupa became of the same yellowish colour; while one fixed itself just where the wood
and brick joined, and became one side red, the other side yellow! These remarkable changes
would perhaps not have been credited, had it not been for the previous observations of Mr.
Wood; but the two support each other, and oblige us to accept them as actual phenomena. It is a
kind of natural photography, the particular coloured rays to which the fresh pupa is exposed in its
soft, semi-transparent condition, effecting such a chemical change in the organic juices as to
produce the same tint in the hardened skin. It is interesting, however, to note that the range of
colour that can be acquired seems to be limited to those of natural objects to which the pupa is
likely to be attached; for when Mrs. Barber surrounded one of the caterpillars with a piece of
scarlet cloth no change of colour at all was produced, the pupa being of the usual green tint, but
the small red spots with which it is marked were brighter than usual.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In these caterpillars and pup&aelig;, as well as in the great majority of cases in which a change of
colour occurs in animals, the action is quite involuntary; but among some of the higher animals
the colour of the integument can be modified at the will of the animal, or at all events by a reflex
action dependent on sensation. The most remarkable case of this kind occurs with the
Chameleon, which has the power of changing its colour from dull white to a variety of tints. This
singular power has been traced to two layers of pigment deeply seated in the skin, from which
minute tubes, or capillary vessels, rise to the surface. The pigment-layers are bluish and
yellowish, and by the pressure of suitable muscles these can be forced upwards either together or
separately. When no pressure is exerted the colour is dirty white, which changes to various tints
of bluish, green, yellow, or brown, as more or less of either pigment is forced up and rendered
visible. The animal is excessively sluggish and defenceless, and its power of changing its colour
to harmonise with surrounding objects is essential to its existence. <font color="990000">[[p. 389]]</font> Here too, as with
the pupa of <em>Papilio Nireus</em>, colours such as scarlet or blue, which do not occur in the immediate
environment of the animal, cannot be produced. Somewhat similar changes of colour occur in
some prawns and flat-fish, according to the colour of the bottom on which they rest. This is very
striking in the Chameleon Shrimp (<em>Mysis Cham&aelig;leon</em>), which is grey when on sand, but brown
or green when among sea-weed of these two colours. Experiment shows, however, that when
blinded the change does not occur, so that here too we probably have a voluntary or reflex sense-action. Many cases are known among insects in which the same species has a different tint
according to its surroundings, this being particularly marked in some South African locusts
which correspond with the colour of the soil wherever they are found; while several caterpillars
which feed on two or more plants vary in colour accordingly. Several such changes are quoted by
Mr. R. Meldola, in a paper on Variable Protective Colouring in Insects (<em>Proceedings of the
Zoological Society of London</em>, 1873, p. 153), and some of them may perhaps be due to a
photographic action of the reflected light. In other cases, however, it has been shown that green
chlorophyll remains unchanged in the tissues of leaf-eating insects, and being discernible through
the transparent integument produces the same colour as that of the food plant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	These peculiar powers of change of colour and adaptation, are however rare and quite
exceptional. As a rule there is no direct connection between the colours of organisms and the
kind of light to which they are usually exposed. This is well seen in most fishes, and in such
marine animals as porpoises, whose backs are always dark, although this part is exposed to the
blue and white light of the sky and clouds, while their bellies are very generally white, although
these are constantly subjected to the deep blue or dusky green light from the bottom. It is evident,
however, that these two tints have been acquired for concealment and protection. Looking <em>down</em>
on the dark back of a fish it is almost invisible, while to an enemy looking <em>up</em> from below the
light undersurface would be equally invisible against the light of the clouds and sky. Again, the
gorgeous colours of the butterflies which inhabit the depths of tropical forests bear no relation to
the kind of light that falls upon them, coming as it does almost wholly from green foliage, dark
brown soil, or blue sky; and the bright underwings of many moths which are only exposed at
night, contrast remarkably with the sombre tints of the upper wings which are more or less
exposed to the various colours of surrounding nature.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We find, then, that neither the general influence 
        of solar light and heat, nor the special action of variously tinted rays, 
        are adequate causes for the wonderful variety, intensity, and complexity, 
        of the colours that everywhere meet us in the animal and vegetable world. 
        Let us therefore take a wider view of these colours, grouping them into 
        classes determined by what we know of their actual uses or special relations 
        to the habits of their possessors. This, which may be termed the functional 
        or biological classification of the colours of living organisms, seems 
        to be best expressed by a division into five groups as follows:--</p>

      <blockquote> <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals . . . . . .

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The nature of the two first groups, Protective and Warning colours, has been so fully detailed
and illustrated in my chapter on &quot;Mimicry and other Protective Resemblances among Animals,&quot;
(<em>Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection</em>, p. 45), that very little need be added here
except a few words of general explanation. Protective colours are exceedingly <font color="990000">[[p. 390]]</font>
prevalent in nature, comprising those of all the white arctic animals, the sandy-coloured desert
forms, and the green birds and insects of tropical forests. It also comprises thousands of cases of
special resemblance--of birds to the surroundings of their nests, and especially of insects to the
bark, leaves, flowers, or soil, on or amid which they dwell. Mammalia, fishes, and reptiles, as
well as mollusca and other marine invertebrates, present similar phenomena; and the more the
habits of animals are investigated, the more numerous are found to be the cases in which their
colours tend to conceal them, either from their enemies or from the creatures they prey upon.
One of the last-observed and most curious of these protective resemblances has been
communicated to me by Sir Charles Dilke. He was shown in Java a pink-coloured <em>Mantis</em>, which,
when at rest, exactly resembled a pink orchis-flower. The Mantis is a carnivorous insect which
lies in wait for its prey, and by its resemblance to a flower the insects it feeds on would be
actually attracted towards it. This one is said to feed especially on butterflies, so that it is really a
living trap and forms its own bait! All who have observed animals, and especially insects, in their
native haunts and attitudes, can understand how it is that an insect which in a cabinet looks
exceedingly conspicuous, may yet, when alive in its peculiar attitude of repose and with its
habitual surroundings, be perfectly well concealed. We can hardly ever tell by the mere
inspection of an animal, whether its colours are protective or not. No one would imagine the
exquisitely beautiful caterpillar of the Emperor-Moth, which is green with pink star-like spots, to
be protectively coloured; yet when feeding on the heather it so harmonises with the foliage and
flowers as to be almost invisible. Every day fresh cases of protective colouring are being
discovered even in our own country, and it is becoming more and more evident that the need of
protection has played a very important part in determining the actual coloration of animals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The second class--the warning colours--are exceedingly interesting, because the object and
effect of these is, not to conceal the object, but to make it conspicuous. To these creatures it is
<em>useful</em> to be seen and recognised, the reason being that they have a means of defence which, if
known, will prevent their enemies from attacking them, though it is generally not sufficient to
save their lives if they are actually attacked. The best examples of these specially protected
creatures consist of two extensive families of butterflies, the Danaid&aelig; and Acr&aelig;id&aelig;, comprising
many hundreds of species inhabiting the tropics of all parts of the world. These insects are
generally large, are all conspicuously and often most gorgeously coloured, presenting almost
every conceivable tint and pattern; they all fly slowly, and they never attempt to conceal
themselves: yet no bird, spider, lizard, or monkey (all of which eat other butterflies) ever touch
them. The reason simply is that they are not fit to eat, their juices having a powerful odour and
taste that is absolutely disgusting to all these animals. Now, we see the reason of their showy
colours and slow flight. It is good for them to be seen and recognised, for then they are never
molested; but if they did not differ in form and colouring from other butterflies, or if they flew so
quickly that their peculiarities could not be easily noticed, they would be captured, and though
not eaten would be maimed or killed. As soon as the cause of the peculiarities of these butterflies
was recognised, it was seen that the same explanation applied to many other groups of animals.
Thus bees and wasps and other stinging insects are showily and distinctively coloured; many soft
and apparently defenceless beetles, and many gay-coloured moths, were found to be as nauseous
as the above-named butterflies; other beetles, whose hard and glossy coats of mail <font color="990000">[[p. 391]]</font>
render them unpalatable to insect-eating birds, are also sometimes showily coloured; and the
same rule was found to apply to caterpillars, all the brown and green (or protectively-coloured
species) being greedily eaten by birds, while showy kinds which never hide themselves--like
those of the magpie-, mullein-, and burnet-moths--were utterly refused by insectivorous birds,
lizards, frogs, and spiders. (<em>Contributions to Theory of Natural Selection</em>, p. 117.) Some few
analogous examples are found among vertebrate animals. I will only mention here a very
interesting case not given in my former work. In his delightful book entitled <em>The Naturalist in
Nicaragua</em>, Mr. Belt tells us that there is in that country a frog which is very abundant, which
hops about in the day-time, which never hides himself, and which is gorgeously coloured with
red and blue. Now frogs are usually green, brown, or earth-coloured, feed mostly at night, and
are all eaten by snakes and birds. Having full faith in the theory of protective and warning
colours, to which he had himself contributed some valuable facts and observations, Mr. Belt felt
convinced that this frog must be uneatable. He therefore took one home, and threw it to his ducks
and fowls; but all refused to touch it except one young duck, which took the frog in its mouth,
but dropped it directly, and went about jerking its head as if trying to get rid of something nasty.
Here the uneatableness of the frog was predicted from its colours and habits, and we can have no
more convincing proof of the truth of the theory than such previsions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The universal avoidance by carnivorous animals of all these specially protected groups,
which are thus entirely free from the constant persecution suffered by other creatures not so
protected, would evidently render it advantageous for any of these latter which were subjected to
extreme persecution to be mistaken for the former, and for this purpose it would be necessary
that they should have the same colours, form, and habits. Strange to say, wherever there is an
extensive, group of directly-protected forms (division <em>a</em> of animals with warning colours), there
are sure to be found a few otherwise defenceless creatures which resemble them externally so as
to be mistaken for them, and which thus gain protection as it were on false pretences, (division <em>b</em>
of animals with warning colours). This is what is called &quot;mimicry,&quot; and it has already been very
fully treated of by Mr. Bates (its discoverer), by myself, by Mr. Trimen, and others. Here it is
only necessary to state that the uneatable Danaid&aelig; and Acr&aelig;id&aelig; are accompanied by a few
species of other groups of butterflies (Leptalid&aelig;, Papilios, Diademas, and Moths) which are all
really eatable, but which escape attack by their close resemblance to some species of the
uneatable groups found in the same locality. In like manner there are a few eatable beetles which
exactly resemble species of uneatable groups, and others which are soft, imitate those which are
uneatable through their hardness. For the same reason wasps are imitated by moths, and ants by
beetles; and even poisonous snakes are mimicked by harmless snakes, and dangerous hawks by
defenceless cuckoos. How these curious imitations have been brought about, and the laws which
govern them, have been discussed in the work already referred to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The third class--Sexual Colours--comprise all cases in which the colours of the two sexes
differ. This difference is very general, and varies greatly in amount, from a slight divergence of
tint up to a radical change of coloration. Differences of this kind are found among all classes of
animals in which the sexes are separated, but they are much more frequent in some groups than
in others. In mammalia, reptiles, and fishes, they are comparatively rare and not great in amount,
whereas among birds they are very frequent and very largely developed. So among <font color="990000">[[p. 392]]</font>
insects, they are abundant in butterflies, while they are comparatively uncommon in beetles,
wasps, and hemiptera.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The phenomena of sexual variations of colour, as well as of colour generally, are
wonderfully similar in the two analogous yet totally unrelated groups of birds and butterflies; and
as they both offer ample materials, we shall confine our study of the subject chiefly to them. The
most common case of difference of colour between the sexes, is for the male to have the same
general hue as the females, but deeper and more intensified; as in many thrushes, finches, and
hawks; and among butterflies in the majority of our British species. In cases where the male is
smaller the intensification of colour is especially well pronounced, as in many of the hawks and
falcons, and in most butterflies and moths in which the coloration does not materially differ. In
another extensive series we have spots or patches of vivid colour in the male which are
represented in the female by far less brilliant tints or are altogether wanting; as exemplified in the
gold-crest warbler, the green woodpecker, and most of the orange-tip butterflies (<em>Anthocharis</em>).
Proceeding with our survey we find greater and greater differences of colour in the sexes, till we
arrive at such extreme cases as some of the pheasants, the chatterers, tanagers, and birds-of-paradise, in which the male is adorned with the most gorgeous and vivid colours, while the
female is usually dull brown, or olive green, and often shows no approximation whatever to the
varied tints of her partner. Similar phenomena occur among butterflies; and in both these classes
there are also a considerable number of cases in which both sexes are highly coloured in a
different way. Thus many woodpeckers have the head in the male red, in the female yellow;
while some parrots have red spots in the male, replaced by blue in the female, as in <em>Psittacula
diopthalma</em>. In many South American Papilios green spots on the male are represented by red on
the female; and in several species of the genus <em>Epicalia</em>, orange bands in the male are replaced by
blue in the female, a similar change of colour as in the small parrot above referred to. For fuller
details of the varieties of sexual coloration we refer our readers to Mr. Darwin's <em>Descent of Man</em>,
chapters x. to xviii., and to chapters iii. iv. and vii. of my <em>Contributions to the Theory of Natural
Selection</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The fourth group--of Typically-coloured animals--includes all species which are brilliantly
or conspicuously coloured in both sexes, and for whose particular colours we can assign no
function or use. It comprises an immense number of showy birds, such as Kingfishers, Barbets,
Toucans, Lories, Tits, and Starlings; among insects most of the largest and handsomest
butterflies, innumerable bright-coloured beetles, locusts, dragon-flies, and hymenoptera; a few
mammalia, as the zebras; a great number of marine fishes; thousands of striped and spotted
caterpillars; and abundance of mollusca, star-fish, and other marine animals. Among these we
have included some, which like the gaudy caterpillars have warning colours; but as that theory
does not explain the particular colours or the varied patterns with which they are adorned, it is
best to include them also in this class. It is a suggestive fact, that all the brightly coloured birds
mentioned above build in holes or form covered nests, so that the females do not need that
protection during the breeding season, which I believe to be one of the chief causes of the dull
colour of female birds when their partners are gaily coloured. This subject is fully argued in my<em>
Contributions</em>, &amp;c., chapter vii.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	As the colours of plants and flowers are very different from those of animals both in their
distribution and functions, it will be well to treat them separately: we will therefore now consider
how the general facts of colour <font color="990000">[[p. 393]]</font> here sketched out can be explained. We have first to
inquire what is colour, and how it is produced; what is known of the causes of change of colour;
and what theory best accords with the whole assemblage of facts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The sensation of colour is caused by vibrations or undulations of the etherial medium of
different lengths and velocities. The whole body of vibrations caused by the sun is termed
radiation, and consists of sets of waves which vary considerably in their dimensions and their
rate of vibration, but of which the middle portion only is capable of exciting in us sensations of
light and colour. Beginning with the largest and slowest rays or wave-vibrations, we have first
those which produce heat-sensations only; as they get smaller and quicker, we perceive a dull red
colour; and as the waves increase in rapidity of vibration and diminish in size, we get
successively sensations of orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, all fading
imperceptibly into each other. Then come more invisible rays, of shorter wave-length and
quicker vibration, which produce, solely or chiefly, chemical effects. The red rays, which first
become visible, have been ascertained to vibrate at the rate of 458 millions of millions of times in
a second, the length of each wave being 1/36900th of an inch; while the violet rays, which last
remain visible, vibrate 727 millions of millions of times per second, and have a wave-length of
1/64516th of an inch. Although the waves vibrate at different rates, they are all propagated
through the ether with the same velocity (192,000 miles per second), just as different musical
sounds, which are produced by waves of <em>air</em> of different lengths and rates of vibration, travel at
the same rate, so that a tune played several hundred yards off reaches the ear in correct time.
There are, therefore, an almost infinite number of different colour-producing vibrations, and
these may be combined in an almost infinite variety of ways, so as to excite in us the sensation of
all the varied colours and tints we are capable of perceiving. When all the different kinds of rays
reach us in the proportion in which they exist in the light of the sun, they produce the sensation
of white. If the rays which excite the sensation of any one colour are prevented from reaching us,
the remaining rays in combination produce a sensation of colour often very far removed from
white. Thus green rays being abstracted leave purple light; blue, orange-red light; violet,
yellowish green light, and so on. These pairs are termed complementary colours. And if portions
of differently coloured lights are abstracted in various degrees, we have produced all those
infinite gradations of colours, and all those varied tints and hues which are of such use to us in
distinguishing external objects, and which form one of the great charms of our existence. Primary
colours would therefore be as numerous as the different wave-lengths of the visible radiations if
we could appreciate all their differences, while secondary or compound colours caused by the
simultaneous action of any combination of rays of different wave-lengths must be still more
numerous. In order to account for the fact that all colours appear to us capable of being produced
by combinations of three primary colours--red, green, and violet--it is believed that we have
three sets of nerve fibres in the retina, each of which is capable of being excited by all rays, but
that one set is excited most by the larger or red waves, another by the medium or green waves,
and the third set chiefly by the violet or smallest waves of light; and when all three sets are
excited together in proper proportions we see white. This view is supported by the phenomena of
colour-blindness, which are explicable on the theory that one of these sets of nerve-fibres
(usually that adapted to perceive red) has lost its sensibility, causing all colours to appear as if
the red rays were abstracted from them. It is <font color="990000">[[p. 394]]</font> another property of these various
radiations, that they are unequally refracted or bent in passing obliquely through transparent
bodies, the longer waves being least refracted, the shorter most. Hence it becomes possible to
analyse white or any other light into its component rays; a small ray of sunlight, for example,
which would produce a round white spot on a wall, if passed through a prism is lengthened out
into a band of coloured light exactly corresponding to the colours of the rainbow. Any one colour
can thus be isolated and separately examined, and by means of reflecting mirrors the separate
colours can be again compounded in various ways, and the resulting colours observed. This band
of coloured light is called a <em>spectrum</em>, and the instrument by which the <em>spectra</em> of various kinds
of light are examined is called a <em>spectroscope</em>. This branch of the subject has, however, no direct
bearing on the mode in which the colours of living things are produced, and it has only been
alluded to in order to complete our sketch of the nature of colour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The colours which we perceive in material substances are produced either by the absorption
or by the interference of some of the rays which form white light. Pigmental or absorption-colours are the most frequent, comprising all the opaque tints of flowers and insects, and all the
colours of dyes and pigments. They are caused by rays of certain wave-lengths being absorbed,
while the remaining rays are reflected and give rise to the sensation of colour. When all the
colour-producing rays are reflected in due proportion the colour of the object is white, when all
are absorbed the colour is black. If blue rays only are absorbed the resulting colour is orange-red;
and generally, whatever colour an object appears to us, it is because the complementary colours
are absorbed by it. The reason why rays of only certain refrangibilities are reflected and the rest
of the incident light absorbed by each substance, is supposed to depend upon the molecular
structure of the body. Chemical action almost always implies change of molecular structure,
hence chemical action is the most potent cause of change of colour. Sometimes simple solution
in water effects a marvellous change, as, in the case of the well-known aniline dyes; the magenta
and violet dyes exhibiting, when in the solid form, various shades of golden or bronzy metallic
green. Heat again often produces change of colour, and this without effecting any chemical
change. Mr. Ackroyd has recently investigated this subject,<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> and has shown that a large number
of bodies are changed by heat, returning to their normal colour when cooled, and that this change
is almost always in the direction of the less refrangible rays or longer wave-lengths; and he
connects the change with molecular expansion caused by heat. As examples may be mentioned
mercuric-oxide, which is orange-yellow, but which changes to orange, red, and brown when
heated; chromic-oxide, which is green, and changes to yellow; cinnabar, which is scarlet, and
changes to puce; and metaborate of copper, which is blue, and changes to green and greenish
yellow. The colouring matters of animals are very varied. Copper has been found in the red of the
wing of the turaco, and Mr. Sorby has detected no less than seven distinct colouring matters in
birds' eggs, several of which are chemically related to those of blood and bile. The same colours
are often produced by quite different substances in different groups, as shown by the red of the
wings of the burnet-moth changing to yellow with muriatic acid, while the red of the red-admiral-butterfly undergoes no such change.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	These pigmental colours have a different character in animals according to their position in
the integument. Following Dr. Hagen's classification, epidermal colours are those which exist in
the external chitinised skin of insects, in the hairs of mammals, and, partially, <font color="990000">[[p. 395]]</font> in the
feathers of birds. They are often very deep and rich, and do not fade after death. The hypodermal
colours are those which are situated in the inferior soft layer of the skin. These are often of
lighter and more vivid tints, and usually fade after death. Many of the reds and yellows of
butterflies and birds belong to this class, as well as the intensely vivid hues of the naked skin
about the heads of many birds. These colours sometimes exude through the pores, forming an
evanescent bloom on the surface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Interference colours are less frequent in the organic world. They are caused in two ways:
either by reflection from the two surfaces of transparent films, as seen in the soap-bubble and in
thin films of oil on water; or by fine stri&aelig; which produce colours either by reflected or
transmitted light, as seen in mother-of-pearl and in finely-ruled metallic surfaces. In both cases
colour is produced by light of one wave-length being neutralised, owing to one set of such waves
being caused to be half a wave-length behind the other set, as may be found explained in any
treatise on physical optics. The result is, that the complementary colour of that neutralised is
seen; and as the thickness of the film or the fineness of the stri&aelig; undergo slight changes almost
any colour can be produced. This is believed to be the origin of many of the glossy or metallic
tints of insects, as well as of those of the feathers of some birds. The iridescent colours of the
wings of dragon-flies are caused by the superposition of two or more transparent lamell&aelig;; while
the shining blue of the Purple-Emperor and other butterflies, and the intensely metallic colours of
humming-birds are probably due to fine stri&aelig;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	This outline sketch of the nature of colour in the animal world, however imperfect, will at
least serve to show us how numerous and varied are the causes which perpetually tend to the
production of colour in animal tissues. If we consider, that in order to produce white all the rays
which fall upon an object must be reflected in the same proportions as they exist in solar light,
whereas if rays of any one or more kinds are absorbed or neutralised the resultant reflected light
will be coloured, and that this colour may be infinitely varied according to the proportions in
which different rays are reflected or absorbed, we should expect that white would be, as it really
is, comparatively rare and exceptional in nature. The same observation will apply to black, which
arises from the absorption of all the different rays. Many of the complex substances which exist
in animals and plants are subject to changes of colour under the influence of light, heat, or
chemical change, and we know that chemical changes are continually occurring during the
physiological processes of development and growth. We also find that every external character is
subject to minute changes, which are generally perceptible to us in closely allied species; and we
can therefore have no doubt that the extension and thickness of the transparent lamell&aelig;, and the
fineness of the stri&aelig; or rugosities of the integuments, must be undergoing constant minute
changes; and these changes will very frequently produce changes of colour. These considerations
render it probable that colour is a normal and even necessary result of the complex structure of
animals and plants, and that those parts of an organism which are undergoing continual
development and adaptation to new conditions, and are also continually subject to the action of
light and heat, will be the parts in which changes of colour will most frequently appear. Now
there is little doubt that the external changes of animals and plants in adaptation to the
environment are much more numerous than the internal changes, as seen in the varied character
of the integuments and appendages of animals--hair, horns, scales, feathers, &amp;c. &amp;c.--and in
plants, the leaves, bark, flowers, and fruit, with their various appendages,--compared with the
comparative uniformity of the texture and <font color="990000">[[p. 396]]</font> composition of their internal tissues; and
this accords with the uniformity of the tints of blood, muscle, nerve, and bone throughout
extensive groups, as compared with the great diversity of colour of their external organs. It seems
a fair conclusion that colour <em>per se</em> may be considered to be normal, and to need no special
accounting for, while the absence of colour (that is, either <em>white</em> or <em>black</em>), or the prevalence of
certain colours to the constant exclusion of others, must be traced, like other modifications in the
economy of living things, to the needs of the species. Or, looking at it in another aspect, we may
say, that amid the constant variations of animals and plants colour is ever tending to vary and to
appear where it is absent, and that natural selection is constantly eliminating such tints as are
injurious to the species, or preserving and intensifying such as are useful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	This view is in accordance with the well-known fact, of colours which rarely or never appear
in the species in a state of nature continually occurring among domesticated animals and
cultivated plants; showing us that the capacity to develop colour is ever present, so that almost
any required tint can be produced which may, under changed conditions, be useful, in however
small a degree.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Let us now see how these principles will enable us to understand and explain the varied
phenomena of colour in nature, taking them in the order of our functional classification of
colours (p. 389).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<em>Theory of Protective Colours</em>.--We have seen that obscure or protective tints in their
infinitely varied degrees are present in every part of the animal kingdom, whole families or
genera being often thus coloured. Now the various brown, earthy, ashy, and other neutral tints
are those which would be most readily produced, because they are due to an irregular mixture of
many kinds of rays; while pure tints require either rays of one kind only, or definite mixtures in
proper proportions of two or more kinds of rays. This is well exemplified by the comparative
difficulty of producing definite pure tints by the mixture of two or more pigments, while a hap-hazard mixture of a number of these will be almost sure to produce browns, olives, or other
neutral or dirty colours. An indefinite or irregular absorption of some rays and reflection of
others would, therefore, produce obscure tints; while pure and vivid colours would require a
perfectly definite absorption of one portion of the coloured rays, leaving the remainder to
produce the true complementary colour. This being the case we may expect these brown tints to
occur when the need of protection is very slight or even when it does not exist at all, always
supposing that bright colours are not in any way useful to the species. But whenever a pure
colour is protective, as green in tropical forests or white among arctic snows, there is no
difficulty in producing it, by natural selection acting on the innumerable slight variations of tint
which are ever occurring. Such variations may, as we have seen, be produced in a great variety of
ways; either by chemical changes in the secretions or by molecular changes in surface structure,
and may be brought about by change of food, by the photographic action of light, or by the
normal process of generative variation. Protective colours therefore, however curious and
complex they may be in certain cases, offer no real difficulties.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<em>Theory of Warning Colours</em>.--These differ greatly from the last class, inasmuch as they
present us with a variety of brilliant hues, often of the greatest purity, and combined in striking
contrasts and conspicuous patterns. Their use depends upon their boldness and visibility, not on
the presence of any one colour; hence we find among these groups some of the most exquisitely-coloured objects in nature. Many of the uneatable caterpillars are strikingly beautiful; while the
Danaid&aelig;, Heliconid&aelig;, and protected groups of Papilionid&aelig; <font color="990000">[[p. 397]]</font> comprise a series of
butterflies of the most brilliant and contrasted colours. The bright colours of many of the sea-anemones and sea-slugs will probably be found to be in this sense protective, serving as a
warning of their uneatableness. On our theory none of these colours offer any difficulty.
Conspicuousness being useful, every variation tending to brighter and purer colours was selected,
the result being the beautiful variety and contrast we find.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But when we come to those groups which gain protection solely by being mistaken for some
of these brilliantly coloured but uneatable creatures, a difficulty really exists, and to many minds
is so great as to be insuperable. It will be well therefore to endeavour to explain how the
resemblance in question may have been brought about. The most difficult case, which may be
taken as a type of the whole, is that of the genus <em>Leptalis</em> (a group of South American butterflies
allied to our common white and yellow kinds), many of the larger species of which are still white
or yellow, and which are all eatable by birds and other insectivorous creatures. But there are also
a number of species of<em> Leptalis</em>, which are brilliantly red, yellow, and black, and which, band for
band and spot for spot, resemble some one of the Danaid&aelig; or Heliconid&aelig; which inhabit the same
district and which are nauseous and uneatable. Now the common objection is, that a slight
approach to one of these protected butterflies would be of no use, while a greater sudden
variation is not admissible on the theory of gradual change by indefinite slight variations. This
objection depends almost wholly on the supposition that when the first steps towards mimicry
occurred, the South American Danaid&aelig; were what they are now, while the ancestors of the
Leptalides were like the ordinary white or yellow Pierid&aelig; to which they are allied. But the
danaioid butterflies of South America are so immensely numerous and so greatly varied, not only
in colour but in structure, that we may be sure they are of vast antiquity and have undergone
great modification. A large number of them, however, are still of comparatively plain colours,
often rendered extremely elegant by the delicate transparency of the wing-membrane, but
otherwise not at all conspicuous. Many have only dusky or purplish bands or spots, others have
patches of reddish or yellowish brown--perhaps the commonest colour among butterflies; while
a considerable number are tinged or spotted with yellow, also a very common colour, and one
especially characteristic of the Pierid&aelig;, the family to which <em>Leptalis</em> belongs. We may therefore
reasonably suppose that in the early stages of the development of the Danaid&aelig;, when they first
began to acquire those nauseous secretions which are now their protection, then colours were
somewhat plain, either dusky with paler bands and spots, or yellowish with dark borders, and
sometimes with reddish bands or spots. At this time they had probably shorter wings and a more
rapid flight, just like the other unprotected families of butterflies. But as soon as they became
decidedly unpalatable to any of their enemies, it would be an advantage to them to be readily
distinguished from all the eatable kinds; and as butterflies were no doubt already very varied in
colour, while all probably had wings adapted for pretty rapid or jerking flight, the best distinction
might have been found in outline and habits; whence would arise the preservation of those
varieties whose longer wings, bodies, and antenn&aelig;, and slower flight rendered them
noticeable,--characters which now distinguish the whole group in every part of the world. Now
it would be at this stage that some of the weaker-flying Pierid&aelig; which happened to resemble
some of the Danaid&aelig; around them in their yellow and dusky tints and in the general outline of
their wings, would be sometimes mistaken for them by the common enemy, and would thus gain
an advantage in the struggle for <font color="990000">[[p. 398]]</font> existence. Admitting this one step to be made, and all
the rest must inevitably follow from simple variation and survival of the fittest. So soon as the
nauseous butterfly varied in form or colour to such an extent that the corresponding eatable
butterfly no longer closely resembled it, the latter would be exposed to attacks, and only those
variations would be preserved which kept up the resemblance. At the same time we may well
suppose the enemies to become more acute and able to detect smaller differences than at first.
This would lead to the destruction of all adverse variations, and thus keep up in continually
increasing complexity the outward mimicry which now so amazes us. During the long ages in
which this process has been going on, many a <em>Leptalis</em> may have become extinct from not
varying sufficiently in the right direction and at the right time to keep up a protective
resemblance to its neighbour; and this will accord with the comparatively small number of cases
of true mimicry as compared with the frequency of those protective resemblances to vegetable or
inorganic objects whose forms are less definite and colours less changeable. About a dozen other
genera of butterflies and moths mimic the Danaid&aelig; in various parts of the world, and exactly the
same explanation will apply to all of them. They represent those species of each group which at
the time when the Danaid&aelig; first acquired their protective secretions happened outwardly to
resemble some of them, and have by concurrent variation, aided by a rigid selection, been able to
keep up that resemblance to the present day.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<em>Theory of Sexual Colours.</em>--In Mr. Darwin's celebrated work, <em>The Descent of Man and
Selection in Relation to Sex</em>, he has treated of sexual colour in combination with other sexual
characters, and has arrived at the conclusion that all or almost all the colours of the higher
animals (including among these insects and all vertebrates) are due to voluntary sexual selection;
and that diversity of colour in the sexes is due, primarily, to the transmission of colour-variations
either to one sex only or to both sexes, the difference depending on some unknown law, and not
being due to natural selection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I have long held this portion of Mr. Darwin's theory to be erroneous, and have argued that
the primary cause of sexual diversity of colour was the need of protection, repressing in the
female those bright colours which are normally produced in both sexes by general laws; and I
have attempted to explain many of the more difficult cases on this principle (&quot;A Theory of Birds'
Nests,&quot; in<em> Contributions</em>, &amp;c., p. 231). As I have since given much thought to this subject, and
have arrived at some views which appear to me to be of considerable importance, it will be well
to sketch briefly the theory I now hold, and afterwards show its application to some of the
detailed cases adduced in Mr. Darwin's work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The very frequent superiority of the male bird or insect in brightness or intensity of colour,
even when the general tints and coloration are the same, now seem to me to be due to the greater
vigour and activity and the higher vitality of the male. The colours of an animal usually fade
during disease or weakness, while robust health and vigour adds to their intensity. This intensity
of coloration is most manifest in the male during the breeding season, when the vitality is at a
maximum. It is also very manifest in those cases in which the male is smaller than the female, as
in the hawks and in most butterflies and moths. The same phenomena occur, though in a less
marked degree, among <font color="990000">[[p. 399]]</font> mammalia. Whenever there is a difference of colour between
the sexes the male is the darker or more strongly marked, and difference of intensity is most
visible during the breeding season (<em>Descent of Man</em>, p. 533). Numerous cases among domestic
animals also prove, that there is an inherent tendency in the male to special developments of
dermal appendages and colour, quite independently of sexual or any other form of selection.
Thus, &quot;the hump on the male zebu cattle of India, the tail of fat-tailed rams, the arched outline of
the forehead in the males of several breeds of sheep, and the mane, the long hairs on the hind-legs, and the dewlap of the male of the Berbura goat,&quot; are all adduced by Mr. Darwin as
instances of characters peculiar to the male, yet not derived from any parent ancestral form.
Among domestic pigeons the character of the different breeds is often most strongly manifested
in the male birds; the wattle of the carriers and the eye-wattles of the barbs are largest in the
males, and male pouters distend their crops to a much greater extent than do the females, and the
cock fantails often have a greater number of tail-feathers than the females. There are also some
varieties of pigeons of which the males are striped or spotted with black while the females are
never so spotted (<em>Animals and Plants under Domestication</em>, I. 161); yet in the parent stock of
these pigeons there are no differences between the sexes either of plumage or colour, and
artificial selection has not been applied to produce them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The greater intensity of coloration in the male--which maybe termed the normal sexual
difference, would be further developed by the combats of the males for the possession of the
females. The most vigorous and energetic usually being able to rear most offspring, intensity of
colour, if dependent on, or correlated with vigour, would tend to increase. But as differences of
colour depend upon minute chemical or structural differences in the organism, increasing vigour
acting unequally on different portions of the integument, and often producing at the same time
abnormal developments of hair, horns, scales, feathers, &amp;c., would almost necessarily lead also
to variable distribution of colour, and thus to the production of new tints and markings. These
acquired colours would, as Mr. Darwin has shown, be transmitted to both sexes or to one only,
according as they first appeared at an early age, or in adults of one sex, and thus we may account
for some of the most marked differences in this respect. With the exception of butterflies, the
sexes are almost alike in the great majority of insects. The same is the case in mammals and
reptiles, while the chief departure from the rule occurs in birds, though even here in very many
cases the law of sexual likeness prevails. But in all cases where the increasing development of
colour became disadvantageous to the female, it would be checked by natural selection, and thus
produce those numerous instances of protective colouring in the female only, which occur in
these two groups of animals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There is also, I believe, a very important purpose and use of the varied colours of the higher
animals, in the facility it affords for recognition by the sexes or by the young of the same species;
and it is this use which probably fixes and determines the coloration in many cases. When
differences of size and form are very slight, colour affords the only means of recognition at a
distance or while in motion, and such a distinctive character must therefore be of especial value
to flying insects which are continually in motion, and encounter each other, as it were, by
accident. This view offers us an explanation of the curious fact, that among butterflies the
females of closely-allied species in the same locality sometimes differ considerably, while the
males are much alike; for as the males are the swiftest and the highest fliers and seek the females,
it would evidently be advantageous <font color="990000">[[p. 400]]</font> for them to be able to recognize their true partners
at some distance off. This peculiarity occurs with many species of <em>Papilio</em>, <em>Diadema</em>, <em>Adolias</em>,
and <em>Colias</em>. In birds such marked differences of colour are not required, owing to their higher
organisation and more perfect senses, which render recognition easy by means of a combination
of very slight differential characters. This principle may, perhaps, however, account for some
anomalies of coloration among the higher animals. Thus, Mr. Darwin, while admitting that the
hare and the rabbit are coloured protectively, remarks that the latter, while running to its burrow,
is made conspicuous to the sportsman, and no doubt to all beasts of prey, by its upturned white
tail. But this very conspicuousness while running away, may be useful as a signal and guide to
the young, who are thus enabled to escape danger by following the older rabbits, directly and
without hesitation, to the safety of the burrow; and this may be the more important from the
semi-nocturnal habits of the animal. If this explanation is correct, and it certainly seems
probable, it may serve as a warning of how impossible it is, without exact knowledge of the
habits of an animal and a full consideration of all the circumstances, to decide that any particular
coloration cannot be protective or in any way useful. Mr. Darwin himself is not free from such
assumptions. Thus, he says: &quot;The zebra is conspicuously striped, and stripes cannot afford any
protection on the open plains of South Africa.&quot; But the zebra is a very swift animal, and, when in
herds, by no means void of means of defence. The stripes therefore <em>may</em> be of use by enabling
stragglers to distinguish their fellows at a distance, and they <em>may</em> be even protective when the
animal is at rest among herbage--the only time when it would need protective colouring. Until
the habits of the zebra have been observed with special reference to this point, it is surely
somewhat hasty to declare that the stripes &quot;cannot afford any protection.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The wonderful display and endless variety of colour in which butterflies and birds so far
exceed all other animals, seems primarily due to the excessive development and endless
variations of the integumentary structures. No insects have such widely expanded wings in
proportion to their bodies as butterflies and moths; in none do the wings vary so much in size and
form, and in none are they clothed with such a beautiful and highly-organized coating of scales.
According to the general principles of the production of colour already explained, these long-continued expansions of membranes and developments of surface-structures must have led to
numerous colour-changes, which have been sometimes checked, sometimes fixed and utilised,
sometimes intensified, by natural selection, according to the needs of the animal. In birds, too,
we have the wonderful clothing of plumage--the most highly organised, the most varied, and the
most expanded of all dermal appendages. The endless processes of growth and change during the
development of feathers, and the enormous extent of this delicately-organised surface, must have
been highly favourable to the production of varied colour-effects, which, when not injurious,
have been merely fixed for purposes of specific identification, but have often been modified or
suppressed whenever different tints were needed for purposes of protection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	To voluntary sexual selection, that is, the actual choice by the females of the more brilliantly-coloured males, I believe very little if any effect is directly due. It is undoubtedly proved that in
birds the females do sometimes exert a choice; but the evidence of this fact collected by Mr.
Darwin (<em>Descent of Man</em>, chap. xiv.) does not prove that colour determines that choice, while
much of the strongest evidence is directly opposed to this view. All the facts appear to be <font color="990000">[[p.
401]]</font> consistent with the choice depending on a variety of male characteristics, with some of
which colour is often correlated. Thus it is the opinion of some of the best observers that vigour
and liveliness are most attractive, and these are no doubt usually associated with intensity of
colour. Again, the display of the various ornamental appendages of the male during courtship
may be attractive, but these appendages, with their bright colours or shaded patterns, are due
probably to general laws of growth and to that superabundant vitality which we have seen to be a
cause of colour. But there are many considerations which seem to show that the possession of
these ornamental appendages and bright colours in the male is not an important character
functionally, and that it has not been produced by the action of voluntary sexual selection. Amid
the copious mass of facts and opinions collected by Mr. Darwin as to the display of colour and
ornaments by the male birds, there is a total absence of any evidence that the females admire or
even notice this display. The hen, the turkey, and the pea-fowl go on feeding while the male is
displaying his finery, and there is reason to believe that it is his persistency and energy rather
than his beauty which wins the day. Again, evidence collected by Mr. Darwin himself proves that
each bird finds a mate under any circumstances. He gives a number of cases of one of a pair of
birds being shot, and the survivor being always found paired again almost immediately. This is
sufficiently explained on the assumption that the destruction of birds by various causes is
continually leaving widows and widowers in nearly equal proportions, and thus each one finds a
fresh mate; and it leads to the conclusion that permanently unpaired birds are very scarce; so that,
speaking broadly, every bird finds a mate and breeds. But this would almost or quite neutralize
any effect of sexual selection of colour or ornament, since the less highly-coloured birds would
be at no disadvantage as regards leaving healthy offspring. If, however, heightened colour is
correlated with health and vigour, and these healthy and vigorous birds provide best for their
young, and leave offspring which, being equally healthy and vigorous, can best provide for
themselves, then natural selection becomes a preserver and intensifier of colour. Another most
important consideration is, that male butterflies rival or even excel the most gorgeous male birds
in bright colours and elegant patterns; and among these there is literally not one particle of
evidence that the female is influenced by colour or even that she has any power of choice, while
there is much direct evidence to the contrary (<em>Descent of Man</em>, p. 318). The weakness of the
evidence for sexual selection among these insects is so palpable that Mr. Darwin is obliged to
supplement it by the singularly inconclusive argument that, &quot;Unless the females prefer one male
to another, the pairing must be left to mere chance, and this does not appear probable (<em>l.c</em>., p.
317).&quot; But he has just said--&quot;The males sometimes fight together in rivalry, and many may be
seen pursuing or crowding round the same female;&quot; while in the case of the silk-moths, &quot;the
females appear not to evince the least choice in regard to their partners.&quot; Surely the plain
inference from all this is, that males fight and struggle for the almost passive female, and that the
most vigorous and energetic, the strongest-winged or the most persevering, wins her. How can
there be chance in this? Natural selection would here act, as in birds, in perpetuating the
strongest and most vigorous males, and as these would usually be the more highly coloured of
their race, the same results would be produced as regards the intensification and variation of
colour in the one case as in the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Let us now see how these principles will apply to some of the cases <font color="990000">[[p. 402]]</font> adduced by
Mr. Darwin in support of his theory of voluntary sexual selection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In <em>Descent of Man</em>, 2nd ed., pp. 307-316, we find an elaborate account of the various modes
of colouring of butterflies and moths, proving that the coloured parts are always more or less
displayed, and that they have some evident relation to an observer. Mr. Darwin then
says--&quot;From the several foregoing facts it is impossible to admit that the brilliant colours of
butterflies, and of some few moths, have commonly been acquired for the sake of protection. We
have seen that their colours and elegant patterns are arranged and exhibited as if for display.
Hence I am led to believe that the females prefer or are most excited by the more brilliant males;
for on any other supposition the males would, as far as we can see, be ornamented to no purpose&quot;
(<em>l.c</em>., p. 316). I am not aware that any one has ever maintained that the brilliant colours of
butterflies have &quot;commonly been acquired for the sake of protection,&quot; yet Mr. Darwin has
himself referred to cases in which the brilliant colour is so placed as to serve for protection; as
for example, the eye-spots on the hind wings of moths, which are pierced by birds and so save
the vital parts of the insect, while the bright patch on the orange-tip butterflies which Mr. Darwin
denies are protective, may serve the same purpose. It is in fact somewhat remarkable how very
generally the black spots, ocelli, or bright patches of colour are on the tips, margins, or discs of
the wings; and as the insects are necessarily visible while flying, and this is the time when they
are most subject to attacks by insectivorous birds, the position of the more conspicuous parts at
some distance from the body may be a real protection to them. Again, Mr. Darwin admits that the
white colour of the male Ghost-moth may render it more easily seen by the female while flying
about in the dusk, and if to this we add that it will be also more readily distinguished from allied
species, we have a reason for diverse ornamentation in these insects quite sufficient to account
for most of the facts, without believing in the selection of brilliant males by the females, for
which there is not a particle of evidence. The facts given to show that butterflies and other
insects can distinguish colours and are attracted by colours similar to their own, are quite
consistent with the view that colour, which continually tends to appear, is utilised for purposes of
identification and distinction, when not required to be modified or suppressed for purposes of
protection. The cases of the females of some species of <em>Thecla</em>, <em>Callidryas</em>, <em>Colias</em>, and
<em>Hipparchia</em>, which have more conspicuous markings than the male, may be due to several
causes: to obtain greater distinction from other species, for protection from birds, as in the case
of the yellow-underwing moths, while sometimes--as in <em>Hipparchia</em>--the lower intensity of
colouring in the female may lead to more contrasted markings. Mr. Darwin thinks that here the
males have selected the more beautiful females, although one chief fact in support of his theory
of voluntary sexual selection is, that throughout the whole animal kingdom the males are usually
so ardent that they will accept any female, while the females are coy, and choose the handsomest
males, whence it is believed the general brilliancy of males as compared with females has arisen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Perhaps the most curious cases of sexual difference of colour are those in which the female is
very much more gaily coloured than the male. This occurs most strikingly in some species of
<em>Pieris</em> in South America, and of <em>Diadema</em> in the Malay islands, and in both cases the females
resemble species of the uneatable Danaid&aelig; and Heliconid&aelig;, and thus gain a protection. In the
case of <em>Pieris pyrrha</em>, <em>P. malenka</em>, and <em>P. lorena</em>, the males are plain white and black, while the
females are orange, yellow, and black, and so banded and spotted as exactly to <font color="990000">[[p. 403]]</font>
resemble species of Heliconid&aelig;. Mr. Darwin admits that these females have acquired these
colours as a protection; but as there is no apparent cause for the strict limitation of the colour to
the female, he believes that it has been kept down in the male by its being <em>unattractive</em> to her.
This appears to me to be a supposition opposed to the whole theory of sexual selection itself. For
this theory is, that minute variations of colour in the male are <em>attractive</em> to the female, have
always been selected, and that thus the brilliant male colours have been produced. But in this
case he thinks that the female butterfly had a constant aversion to every trace of colour, even
when we must suppose it was constantly recurring during the successive variations which
resulted in such a marvellous change in herself. But if we consider the fact that the females
frequent the forests where the Heliconid&aelig; abound, while the males fly much in the open, and
assemble in great numbers with other white and yellow butterflies on the banks of rivers, may it
not be possible that the appearance of orange stripes or patches would be as injurious to the male
as it is useful to the female, by making him a more easy mark for insectivorous birds among his
white companions? This seems a more probable supposition, than the altogether hypothetical
choice of the female, sometimes exercised in favour of and sometimes against every new variety
of colour in her partner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The full and interesting account given by Mr. Darwin of the colours and habits of male and
female birds (<em>Descent of Man</em>, chapters xiii. and xiv.), proves that in most, if not in all cases, the
male birds fully display their ornamental plumage, before the females and in rivalry with each
other; but on the essential point of whether the female's choice is determined by minute
differences in these ornaments or in their colours, there appears to be an entire absence of
evidence. In the section on &quot;<em>Preference for particular Males by the Females</em>,&quot; the facts quoted
show indifference to colour, except that some colour similar to their own seems to be preferred.
But in the case of the hen canary, who chose a greenfinch in preference to either chaffinch or
goldfinch, gay colours had evidently no preponderating attraction. There is some evidence
adduced that female birds may, and probably do, choose their mates, but none whatever that the
choice is determined by difference of colour; and no less than three eminent breeders informed
Mr. Darwin that they &quot;did not believe that the females prefer certain males on account of the
beauty of their plumage.&quot; Again, Mr. Darwin himself says: &quot;as a general rule colour appears to
have little influence on the pairing of pigeons.&quot; The oft-quoted case of Sir R. Heron's peahens
which preferred an &quot;old pied cock&quot; to those normally coloured, is a very unfortunate one,
because pied birds are just those that are not favoured in a state of nature, or the breeds of wild
birds would become as varied and mottled as our domestic varieties. If such irregular fancies
were not rare exceptions the production of definite colours and patterns by the choice of the
female birds, or in any other way, would be impossible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	We now come to such wonderful developments of plumage and colour as are exhibited by
the peacock and the Argus-pheasant; and I may here mention that it was the case of the latter
bird, as fully discussed by Mr. Darwin, which first shook my belief in &quot;sexual,&quot; or more properly
&quot;female&quot; selection. The long series of gradations, by which the beautifully shaded ocelli on the
secondary wing-feathers of this bird have been produced, are clearly traced out, the result being a
set of markings, so exquisitely shaded as to represent &quot;balls lying loose within sockets,&quot;--purely
artificial objects of which these birds could have no possible knowledge. That this result should
have been attained through thousands and tens <font color="990000">[[p. 404]]</font> of thousands of female birds all
preferring those males whose markings varied slightly in this one direction, this uniformity of
choice continuing through thousands and tens of thousands of generations, is to me absolutely
incredible. And, when further, we remember that those which did not so vary would also,
according to all the evidence, find mates and leave off-spring, the actual result seems quite
impossible of attainment by such means.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Without pretending to solve completely so difficult a problem, I would point out a
circumstance which seems to afford a clue. It is, that the most highly-coloured and most richly-varied markings, occur on those parts of the plumage which have undergone the greatest
modification, or have acquired the most abnormal development. In the peacock, the tail-coverts
are enormously developed, and the &quot;eyes&quot; are situated on the greatly dilated ends. In the birds of
paradise, breast, or neck, or head, or tail-feathers, are greatly developed and highly coloured. The
hackles of the cock, and the scaly breasts of humming-birds are similar developments; while in
the Argus-pheasant the secondary quills are so enormously lengthened and broadened as to have
become almost useless for flight. Now it is easily conceivable, that during this process of
development, inequalities in the distribution of colour may have arisen in different parts of the
same feather, and that spots and bands may thus have become broadened out into shaded spots or
ocelli, in the way indicated by Mr. Darwin, much as the spots and rings on a soap bubble
increase with increasing tenuity. This is the more probable, as in domestic fowls varieties tend to
become symmetrical, quite independently of sexual selection. (<em>Descent of Man</em>, p. 424.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	If now we accept the evidence of Mr. Darwin's most trustworthy correspondents, that the
choice of the female, so far as she exerts any, falls upon the &quot;most vigorous, defiant, and
mettlesome male;&quot; and if we further believe, what is certainly the case, that these are as a rule the
most brightly coloured and adorned with the finest developments of plumage, we have a real and
not a hypothetical cause at work. For these most healthy, vigorous, and beautiful males will have
the choice of the finest and most healthy females, will have the most numerous and healthy
families, and will be able best to protect and rear those families. Natural selection, and what may
be termed male selection, will tend to give them the advantage in the struggle for existence, and
thus the fullest plumage and the finest colours will be transmitted, and tend to advance in each
succeeding generation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There remains, however, what Mr. Darwin evidently considers his strongest argument--the
display by the male of each species of its peculiar beauties of plumage and colour. We have here,
no doubt, a very remarkable and very interesting fact; but this too may be explained by general
principles, quite independent of any choice or volition of the female bird. During pairing-time,
the male bird is in a state of great excitement, and full of exuberant energy. Even unornamented
birds flutter their wings or spread them out, erect their tails or crests, and thus give vent to the
nervous excitability with which they are overcharged. It is not improbable that crests and other
erectile feathers may be primarily of use in frightening away enemies, since they are generally
erected when angry or during combat. Those individuals who were most pugnacious and defiant,
and who brought these erectile plumes most frequently and most powerfully into action, would
tend to increase them by use, and to leave them further developed in some of their descendants.
If, in the course of this development, colour appeared, we have every reason to believe it would
be most vivid in these most pugnacious and energetic <font color="990000">[[p. 405]]</font> individuals, and as these would
always have the advantage in the rivalry for mates (to which advantage the excess of colour and
plumage might sometimes conduce), there seems nothing to prevent a progressive development
of these ornaments in <em>all dominant races</em>, that is, wherever there was such a surplus of vitality,
and such complete adaptation to conditions, that the inconvenience or danger produced by them,
was so comparatively small as not to affect the superiority of the race over its nearest allies. If
then those portions of the plumage, which were originally erected and displayed, became
developed and coloured, the actual display, under the influence of jealousy or sexual excitement
becomes intelligible. The males, in their rivalry with each other, would see what plumes were
most effective, and each would endeavour to excel his enemy as far as voluntary exertion could
effect it, just as they endeavour to rival each other in song, even sometimes to the point of
causing their own destruction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There is also a general argument against Mr. Darwin's views on this question, founded on
the nature and potency of &quot;natural&quot; as opposed to &quot;sexual&quot; selection, which appears to me to be
itself almost conclusive of the whole matter at issue. Natural selection, or the survival of the
fittest, acts perpetually and on an enormous scale. Taking the offspring of each pair of birds as,
on the average, only six annually, one-third of these at most will be preserved, while the two-thirds which are least fitted will die. At intervals of a few years, whenever unfavourable
conditions occur, five-sixths, nine-tenths, or even a greater proportion of the whole yearly
production are weeded out, leaving only the most perfect and best adapted to survive. Now
unless these survivors are on the whole the most ornamental, this rigid selective power must
neutralise and destroy any influence that may be exerted by female selection. For the utmost that
can be claimed for this is, that a small fraction of the least ornamented do not obtain mates, while
a few of the most ornamented may leave more than the average number of offspring. Unless,
therefore, there is the strictest correlation between ornament and general perfection, the former
can have no permanent advantage; and if there is (as I maintain) such a correlation, then the
sexual selection of ornament for which there is little or no evidence becomes needless, because
natural selection which is an admitted <em>vera causa</em> will itself produce all the results. In the case of
butterflies the argument becomes even stronger, because the fertility is so much greater, and the
weeding out of the unfit takes place, to a great extent, in the egg and larv&aelig; state. Unless the eggs
and larva which escaped to produce the next generation were those which would produce the
more highly-coloured butterflies, it is difficult to perceive how the slight preponderance of
colour sometimes selected by the females, should not be wholly neutralised by the extremely
rigid selection for other qualities to which the offspring in every stage are exposed. The only way
in which we can account for the observed facts is, by the supposition that colour and ornament
are strictly correlated with health, vigour, and general fitness to survive. We have shown that
there is reason to believe that this is the case, and if so, voluntary sexual selection becomes as
unnecessary as it would certainly be ineffective.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There is one other very curious case of sexual colouring among birds--that, namely, in
which the female is decidedly brighter or more strongly marked than the male; as in the fighting
quails (<em>Turnix</em>), painted snipe (<em>Rhynchœa</em>), two species of phalarope (<em>Phalaropus</em>), and the
common cassowary (<em>Casuarius galeatus</em>). In all these cases, it is known that the males take
charge of and incubate the eggs, while the females are almost always larger and more
pugnacious. In my &quot;Theory of Birds' Nests&quot; (<em>Natural Selection</em>, <font color="990000">[[p. 406]]</font> p. 251), I imputed this
difference of colour to the greater need for protection by the male bird while incubating, to which
Mr. Darwin has objected that the difference is not sufficient, and is not always so distributed as
to be most effective for this purpose, and he believes that it is due to reversed sexual selection,
that is, to the female taking the usual <em>r&ocirc;le</em> of the male, and being chosen for her brighter tints. We
have already seen reason for rejecting this latter theory in every case, and I also admit that my
theory of protection is, in this case, only partially if at all applicable. But the general theory of
intensity of colour being due to general vital energy is quite applicable; and the fact that the
superiority of the female in this respect is quite exceptional, and is therefore probably not of very
ancient date in any one case, will account for the difference of colour thus produced being
always comparatively slight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<em>Theory of Typical Colours</em>.--The remaining kinds of animal colours--those which can
neither be classed as protective, warning, nor sexual, are for the most part readily explained on
the general principles of the development of colour which we have now laid down. It is a most
suggestive fact, that, in cases where colour is required only as a warning, as among the uneatable
caterpillars, we find, not one or two glaring tints only but every kind of colour disposed in
elegant patterns, and exhibiting almost as much variety and beauty as among insects and birds.
Yet here, not only is sexual selection out of the question, but the need for recognition and
identification by others of the same species, seems equally unnecessary. We can then only
impute this variety to the normal production of colour in organic forms, when fully exposed to
light and air and undergoing great and rapid developmental modification. Among more perfect
animals, where the need for recognition has been added, we find intensity and variety of colour at
its highest pitch among the South American butterflies of the families Heliconid&aelig; and Danaid&aelig;,
as well as among the Nymphalid&aelig; and Erycinid&aelig;, many of which obtain the necessary protection
in other ways. Among birds also, wherever the habits are such that no special protection is
needed for the females, and where the species frequent the depths of tropical forests and are thus
naturally protected from the swoop of birds of prey, we find almost equally intense coloration; as
in the trogons, barbets, and gapers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Of the mode of action of the general principles of colour-development among animals, we
have an excellent example in the humming-birds. Of all birds these are at once the smallest, the
most active, and the fullest of vital energy. When poised in the air their wings are invisible,
owing to the rapidity of their motion, and when startled they dart away with the rapidity of a
flash of light. Such active creatures would not be an easy prey to any rapacious bird; and if one at
length was captured, the morsel obtained would hardly repay the labour. We may be sure,
therefore, that they are practically unmolested. The immense variety they exhibit in structure,
plumage, and colour, indicates a high antiquity for the race, while their general abundance in
individuals shows that they are a dominant group, well adapted to all the conditions of their
existence. Here we find everything necessary for the development of colour and accessory
plumes. The surplus vital energy shown in their combats and excessive activity, has expended
itself in ever-increasing developments of plumage, and greater and greater intensity of colour,
regulated only by the need for specific identification which would be especially required in such
small and mobile creatures. Thus may be explained those remarkable differences of colour
between closely-allied species, one having a <font color="990000">[[p. 407]]</font> crest like the topaz, while in another it
resembles the sapphire. The more vivid colours and more developed plumage of the males, I am
now inclined to think may be wholly due to their greater vital energy, and to those general laws
which lead to such superior developments even in domestic breeds; but in some cases the need of
protection by the female while incubating, to which I formerly imputed the whole phenomenon,
may have suppressed a portion of the ornament which she would otherwise have attained.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Another real, though as yet inexplicable cause of diversity of colour, is to be found in the
influence of locality. It is observed that species of totally distinct groups are coloured alike in one
district, while in another district the allied species all undergo the same change of colour. Cases
of this kind have been adduced by Mr. Bates, by Mr. Darwin, and by myself, and I have collected
all the more curious and important examples in my Address to the Biological Section of the
British Association at Glasgow in 1876. The most probable cause for these simultaneous
variations would seem to be the presence of peculiar elements or chemical compounds in the soil,
the water, or the atmosphere, or of special organic substances in the vegetation; and a wide field
is thus offered for chemical investigation in connection with this interesting subject. Yet,
however we may explain it, the fact remains of the same vivid colours in definite patterns being
produced in quite unrelated groups, which only agree, so far as we yet know, in inhabiting the
same locality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Let us now sum up the conclusion at which we have arrived, as to the various modes in
which colour is produced or modified in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The various causes of colour in the animal world are, molecular and chemical change of the
substance of their integuments, or the action on it of heat, light or moisture. It is also produced by
interference of light in superposed transparent lamell&aelig;, or by excessively fine surface stri&aelig;.
These elementary conditions for the production of colour are found everywhere in the surface-structures of animals, so that its presence must be looked upon as normal, its absence as
exceptional.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Colours are fixed or modified in animals by natural selection for various purposes; obscure
or imitative colours for concealment--gaudy colours as a warning--and special markings, either
for easy recognition by strayed individuals, females, or young, or to direct attack from a vital
part, as in the large brilliantly-marked wings of some butterflies and moths.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Colours are produced or intensified by processes of development,--either where the
integument or its appendages undergo great extension or modification, or where there is a surplus
of vital energy, as in male animals generally, and more especially at the breeding-season.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Colours are also more or less influenced by a variety of causes, such as the nature of the
food, the photographic action of light, and also by some unknown local action probably
dependent on chemical peculiarities in the soil or vegetation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	These various causes have acted and reacted in a variety of ways, and have been modified by
conditions dependent on age or on sex, on competition with new forms, or on geographical or
climatic changes. In so complex a subject, for which experiment and systematic inquiry has done
so little, we cannot expect to explain every individual case, or solve every difficulty; but it is
believed that all the great features of animal coloration and many of the details become
explicable on the principles we have endeavoured to lay down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It will perhaps be considered presumptuous to put forth this sketch of the subject of colour in
animals, as a substitute for one of Mr. Darwin's most highly elaborated theories--that of
voluntary or perceptive sexual <font color="990000">[[p. 408]]</font> selection; yet I venture to think that it is more in
accordance with the whole of the facts, and with the theory of natural selection itself; and I
would ask such of my readers as may be sufficiently interested in the subject, to read again
chapters xi. to xvi. of the <em>Descent of Man</em>, and consider the whole theory from the point of view
here laid down. The explanation of almost all the ornaments and colours of birds and insects as
having been produced by the perceptions and choice of the females has, I believe, staggered
many evolutionists, but has been provisionally accepted because it was the only theory that even
attempted to explain the facts. It may perhaps be a relief to some of them, as it has been to
myself, to find that the phenomena can be shown to depend on the general laws of development,
and on the action of &quot;natural selection,&quot; which theory will, I venture to think, be relieved from an
abnormal excrescence, and gain additional vitality by the adoption of my view of the subject.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Although we have arrived at the conclusion that tropical light and heat can in no sense be
considered the cause of colour, there remains to be explained the undoubted fact that all the more
intense and gorgeous tints are manifested by the animal life of the tropics, while in some groups,
such as butterflies and birds, there is a marked preponderance of highly-coloured species. This is
probably due to a variety of causes, some of which we can indicate, while others remain to be
discovered. The luxuriant vegetation of the tropics throughout the entire year, affords so much
concealment, that colour may there be safely developed to a much greater extent than in climates
where the trees are bare in winter, during which season the struggle for existence is most severe,
and even the slightest disadvantage may prove fatal. Equally important, probably, has been the
permanence of favourable conditions in the tropics, allowing certain groups to continue dominant
for long periods, and thus to carry out in one unbroken line whatever developments of plumage
or colour may once have acquired an ascendency. Changes of climatal conditions, and pre-eminently the glacial epoch, probably led to the extinction of a host of highly-developed and
finely-coloured insects and birds in temperate zones, just as we know that it led to the extinction
of the larger and more powerful mammalia which formerly characterised the temperate zone in
both hemispheres. This view is supported by the fact, that it is amongst those groups only which
are now exclusively tropical, that all the more extraordinary developments of ornament and
colour are found. The local causes of colour will also have acted best in regions where the
climatal conditions remained constant, and where migration was unnecessary; while whatever
direct effect may be produced by light or heat, will necessarily have acted more powerfully
within the tropics. And lastly, all these causes have been in action over an actually greater area in
tropical than in temperate zones, while estimated potentially, in proportion to its life-sustaining
power, the lands which enjoy a practically tropical climate (extending as they do considerably
beyond the geographical tropics), are very much larger than the temperate regions of the earth.
Combining the effects of all these various causes we are quite able to understand the superiority
of the tropical parts of the globe, not only in the abundance and variety of their forms of life, but
also as regards the ornamental appendages and vivid coloration which these forms present.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The colouring of plants is neither so varied nor so complex as that of animals, and its
explanation accordingly offers fewer difficulties. The colours of foliage are, comparatively, little
varied, and can be traced in almost all cases to a special pigment termed chlorophyll, to which is
due the general green colour of leaves; but the recent investigations of Mr. Sorby and others have
shown that chlorophyll is not a simple green pigment, but that it really consists of at least seven
distinct substances, varying in colour from blue to yellow and orange. These differ in their
proportions in the chlorophyll of different plants; they have different chemical reactions; they are
differently affected by light; and they give distinct spectra. Mr. Sorby further states that scores of
different colouring matters are found in the leaves and flowers of plants, to some of which
appropriate names have been given, as erythrophyll which is red, and phaiophyll which is brown;
and many of these differ greatly from each other in their chemical composition. These inquiries
are at present in their infancy, but as the original term chlorophyll seems scarcely applicable
under the present aspect of the subject, it would perhaps be better to introduce the analogous
word Chromophyll as a general term for the colouring matters of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Light has a much more decided action on plants than on animals. The green colour of leaves
is almost wholly dependent on it; and although some flowers will become fully coloured in the
dark, others are decidedly affected by the absence of light, even when the foliage is fully exposed
to it. Looking therefore at the numerous coloured substances which are developed in the tissues
of plants; the sensitiveness of these pigments to light; the changes they undergo during growth
and development; and the facility with which new chemical combinations are effected by the
physiological processes of plants as shown by the endless variety in the chemical constitution of
vegetable products, we have no difficulty in comprehending the general causes which aid in
producing the colours of the vegetable world, or the extreme variability of those colours. We may
therefore here confine ourselves to an inquiry into the various uses of colour in the economy of
plants; and this will generally enable us to understand how it has become fixed and specialised in
the several genera and species of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In animals, as we have seen, colour is greatly influenced by the need of protection from or of
warning to their numerous enemies, and to the necessity for identification and easy recognition.
Plants rarely need to be concealed, and obtain protection either by their spines, their hardness,
their hairy covering, or their poisonous secretions. A very few cases of what seem to be true
protective colouring do, however, exist, the most remarkable being that of the &quot;stone
mesembryanthemum,&quot; of the Cape of <font color="990000">[[p. 465]]</font> Good Hope, which in form and colour closely
resembles the stones among which it grows; and Dr. Burchell, who first discovered it, believes
that the juicy little plant thus generally escapes the notice of cattle and wild herbivorous animals.
Mr. J. P. Mansel Weale also noticed that many plants growing in the stony Karoo have their
tuberous roots above the soil, and these so perfectly resemble the stones among which they grow
that, when not in leaf, it is almost impossible to distinguish them (<em>Nature</em>, vol. iii. p. 507). A few
cases of what seem to be protective mimicry have also been noted, the most curious being that of
three very rare British fungi, found by Mr. Worthington Smith, each in company with common
species, which they so closely resembled that only a minute examination could detect the
difference. One of the common species is stated in botanical works to be &quot;bitter and nauseous,&quot;
so that it is not improbable that the rare kind may escape being eaten by being mistaken for an
uneatable species though itself palatable. Mr. Mansel Weale also mentions a labiate plant, the
<em>Ajuga ophrydis</em>, of South Africa, as strikingly resembling an orchid. This may be a means of
attracting insects to fertilize the flower in the absence of sufficient nectar or other attraction in
the flower itself; and the supposition is rendered more probable by this being the only species of
the genus Ajuga in South Africa. Many other cases of resemblances between very distinct plants
have been noticed--as that of some Euphorbias to Cacti; but these very rarely inhabit the same
country or locality, and it has not been proved that there is in any of these cases the amount of
inter-relation between the species which is the essential feature of the protective &quot;mimicry&quot; that
occurs in the animal world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The different colours exhibited by the foliage of plants, and the changes it undergoes during
growth and decay, appear to be due to the general laws already sketched out, and to have little if
any relation to the special requirements of each species. But flowers and fruits exhibit definite
and well-pronounced tints, often varying from species to species, and more or less clearly related
to the habits and functions of the plant. With the few exceptions already pointed out, these may
be generally classed as <em>attractive</em> colours. The seeds of plants require to be dispersed so as to
reach places favourable for germination and growth. Some are very minute, and are carried
abroad by the wind, or they are violently expelled and scattered by the bursting of the containing
capsules. Others are downy or winged, and are carried long distances by the gentlest breeze. But
there is a large class of seeds which cannot be dispersed in either of these ways, and are mostly
contained in eatable fruits. These fruits are devoured by birds or beasts, and the hard seeds pass
through their stomachs undigested, and, owing probably to the gentle heat and moisture to which
they have been subjected, in a condition highly favourable for germination. The dry fruits or
capsules containing the first two classes of seeds are rarely, if ever, conspicuously coloured,
whereas the eatable fruits almost invariably acquire a bright colour as they ripen, while at the
same time they become soft and often full of agreeable juices. Our <em>red</em> haws and hips, our <em>black</em>
elderberries, our <em>blue</em> sloes and whortleberries, our <em>white</em> mistletoe and snowberry, and our
<em>orange</em> sea-buckthorn, are examples of the colour-sign of edibility; and in every part of the world
the same phenomenon is found. The fruits of large forest-trees, such as the pines, oaks, and
beeches, are not coloured, perhaps because their size and abundance render them sufficiently
conspicuous, and also because they provide such a quantity of food to such a number of different
animals that there is no danger of their being unnoticed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The colours of flowers serve to render them visible and recognisable <font color="990000">[[p. 466]]</font> by insects
which are attracted by secretions of nectar or pollen. During their visits for the purpose of
obtaining these products, insects involuntarily carry the pollen of one flower to the stigma of
another, and thus effect cross-fertilization, which, as Mr. Darwin was the first to demonstrate,
immensely increases the vigour and fertility of the next generation of plants. This discovery has
led to the careful examination of great numbers of flowers, and the result has been that the most
wonderful and complex arrangements have been found to exist, all having for their object to
secure that flowers shall not be self-fertilised perpetually, but that pollen shall be carried, either
constantly or occasionally, from the flowers of one plant to those of another. Mr. Darwin himself
first worked out the details in orchids, primulas, and some other groups; and hardly less curious
phenomena have since been found to occur, even among some of the most regularly-formed
flowers. The arrangement, length, and position of all the parts of the flower is now found to have
a purpose, and not the least remarkable portion of the phenomenon is the great variety of ways in
which the same result is obtained. After the discoveries with regard to orchids, it was to be
expected that the irregular, tubular, and spurred flowers should present various curious
adaptations for fertilization by insect-agency. But even among the open, cup-shaped, and quite
regular flowers, in which it seemed inevitable that the pollen must fall on the stigma, and
produce constant self-fertilization, it has been found that this is often prevented by a
physiological variation--the anthers constantly emitting their pollen either a little earlier or a
little later than the stigmas of the same flower, or of other flowers on the same plant, were in the
best state to receive it; and as individual plants in different stations, soils, and aspects, differ
somewhat in the time of flowering, the pollen of one plant would often be conveyed by insects to
the stigmas of some other plant in a condition to be fertilized by it. This mode of securing cross-fertilization seems so simple and easy, that we can hardly help wondering why it did not always
come into action, and so obviate the necessity for those elaborate, varied, and highly complex
contrivances found in perhaps the majority of coloured flowers. The answer to this of course is,
that <em>variation</em> sometimes occurred most freely in one part of a plant's organization, and
sometimes in another, and that the benefit of cross-fertilization was so great that <em>any</em> variation
that favoured it was preserved, and then formed the starting-point of a whole series of further
variations, resulting in those marvellous adaptations for insect fertilization, which have given
much of their variety, elegance, and beauty, to the floral world. For details of these adaptations
we must refer the reader to the works of Darwin, Lubbock, Herman M&uuml;ller, and others. We have
here only to deal with the part played by colour, and by those floral structures in which colour is
most displayed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The sweet odours of flowers, like their colours, seem often to have been developed as an
attraction or guide to insect fertilizers, and the two phenomena are often complementary to each
other. Thus, many inconspicuous flowers--like the mignonette and the sweet-violet, can be
distinguished by their odours before they attract the eye, and this may often prevent their being
passed unnoticed; while very showy flowers, and especially those with variegated or spotted
petals, are seldom sweet. White, or very pale flowers, on the other hand, are often excessively
sweet, as exemplified by the jasmine and clematis; and many of these are only scented at night,
as is strikingly the case with the night-smelling stock, our butterfly orchis (<em>Habenaria
chlorantha</em>), the greenish-yellow, <em>Daphne pontica</em>, and many others. These white flowers <font color="990000">[[p.
467]]</font> are mostly fertilized by night-flying moths, and those which reserve their odours for the
evening probably escape the visits of diurnal insects which would consume their nectar without
effecting fertilization. The absence of odour in showy flowers and its preponderance among
those that are white, may be shown to be a fact by an examination of the lists in Mr.
Mongredien's work on hardy trees and shrubs.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> He gives a list of about one hundred and sixty
species with showy flowers, and another list of sixty species with fragrant flowers; but only
twenty of these latter are included among the showy species, and these are almost all white
flowered. Of the sixty species with fragrant flowers, more than forty are white, and a number of
others have greenish, yellowish, or dusky and inconspicuous flowers. The relation of white
flowers to nocturnal insects is also well shown by those which, like the evening primroses, only
open their large white blossoms after sunset. The red Martagon lily has been observed by Mr.
Herman M&uuml;ller to be fertilized by the humming-bird hawk moth, which flies in the morning and
afternoon when the colours of this flower, exposed to the nearly horizontal rays of the sun, glow
with brilliancy, and when it also becomes very sweet-scented.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	To the same need of conspicuousness the combination of so many individually small flowers
into heads and bunches is probably due, producing such broad masses as those of the elder, the
gueldre-rose, and most of the Umbellifer&aelig;, or such elegant bunches as those of the lilac,
laburnum, horse-chestnut, and wistaria. In other cases minute flowers are gathered into dense
heads, as with <em>Globularia</em>, <em>Jasione</em>, clover, and all the Composit&aelig;; and among the latter the outer
flowers are often developed into a ray, as in the sunflowers, the daisies, and the asters, forming a
starlike compound flower, which is itself often produced in immense profusion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The beauty of alpine flowers is almost proverbial. It consists either in the increased size of
the individual flowers as compared with the whole plant, in increased intensity of colour, or in
the massing of small flowers into dense cushions of bright colour; and it is only in the higher
Alps, above the limit of forests and upwards towards the perpetual snow-line that these
characteristics are fully exhibited. This effort at conspicuousness under adverse circumstances
may be traced to the comparative scarcity of winged insects in the higher regions, and to the
necessity for attracting them from a distance. Amid the vast slopes of debris and the huge masses
of rock so prevalent in higher mountain regions, patches of intense colour can alone make
themselves visible and serve to attract the wandering butterfly from the valleys. Mr. Herman
M&uuml;ller's careful observations have shown, that in the higher Alps bees and most other groups of
winged insects are almost wanting, while butterflies are tolerably abundant; and he has
discovered, that in a number of cases where a lowland flower is adapted to be fertilized by bees,
its alpine ally has had its structure so modified as to be adapted for fertilization only by
butterflies.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> But bees are always (in the temperate zone) far more abundant than butterflies, and
this will be another reason why flowers specially adapted to be fertilized by the latter should be
rendered unusually conspicuous. We find, accordingly, the yellow primrose of the plains
replaced by pink and magenta-coloured alpine species; the straggling wild pinks of the lowlands
by the masses of large flowers in such mountain species as <em>Dianthus alpinus</em> and <em>D. glacialis</em>; the
saxifrages of the high Alps with bunches of flowers a foot long, as in <em>Saxifraga longifolia</em> and <em>S.
cotyledon</em>, or forming spreading masses of flowers, as in <em>S. oppositifolia</em>; while the soap- <font color="990000">[[p.
468]]</font> worts, silenes, and louseworts are equally superior to the allied species of the plains.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Again, Dr. M&uuml;ller has discovered that when there are showy and inconspicuous species in
the same genus of plants, there is often a corresponding difference of structure, those with large
and showy flowers being quite incapable of self-fertilization, and thus depending for their very
existence on the visits of insects; while the others are able to fertilize themselves should insects
fail to visit them. We have examples of this difference in <em>Malva sylvestris</em>, <em>Epilobium
angustifolium</em>, <em>Polygonum bistorta</em>, and <em>Geranium pratense</em>--which have all large or showy
flowers and must be fertilized by insects,--as compared with <em>Malva rotundifolia</em>, <em>Epilobium
parviflorum</em>, <em>Polygonum aviculare</em>, and <em>Geranium pusillum</em>, which have small or inconspicuous
flowers, and are so constructed that if insects should not visit them they are able to fertilize
themselves.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	As supplementing these curious facts showing the relation of colour in flowers to the need of
the visits of insects to fertilize them, we have the remarkable, and on any other theory utterly
inexplicable circumstance, that in all the numerous cases in which plants are fertilized by the
agency of the wind they never have specially coloured floral envelopes. Such are our pines, oaks,
poplars, willows, beeches, and hazel; our nettles, grasses, sedges, and many others. In some of
these the male flowers are, it is true, conspicuous, as in the catkins of the willows and the hazel,
but this arises incidentally from the masses of pollen necessary to secure fertilization, as shown
by the entire absence of a corolla or of those coloured bracts which so often add to the beauty
and conspicuousness of true flowers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The adaptation of flowers to be fertilized by insects--often to such an extent that the very
existence of the species depends upon it--has had widespread influence on the distribution of
plants and the general aspects of vegetation. The seeds of a particular species may be carried to
another country, may find there a suitable soil and climate, may grow and produce flowers, but if
the insect which alone can fertilize it should not inhabit that country, the plant cannot maintain
itself, however frequently it may be introduced or however vigorously it may grow. Thus may
probably be explained the poverty in flowering-plants and the great preponderance of ferns that
distinguishes many oceanic islands, as well as the deficiency of gaily-coloured flowers in others.
This branch of the subject is discussed at some length in my Address to the Biological Section of
the British Association,<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> but I may here just allude to two of the most striking cases. New
Zealand is, in proportion to its total number of flowering plants, exceedingly poor in handsome
flowers, and it is correspondingly poor in insects, especially in bees and butterflies, the two
groups which so greatly aid in fertilization. In both these aspects it contrasts strongly with
Southern Australia and Tasmania in the same latitudes, where there is a profusion of gaily-coloured flowers and an exceedingly rich insect-fauna. The other case is presented by the
Galapagos islands, which, though situated on the equator off the west coast of South America,
and with a tolerably luxuriant vegetation in the damp mountain zone, yet produce hardly a single
conspicuously-coloured flower; and this is correlated with, and no doubt dependent on, an
extreme poverty of insect life, not one bee and only a single butterfly having been found there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Again, there is reason to believe that some portion of the large size and corresponding
showiness of tropical flowers is due to their being fertilized by very large insects and even by
birds. Tropical sphinx-moths often have their probosces nine or ten inches long, and we find
flowers whose tubes or spurs reach about the same length; while the giant bees, and the <font color="990000">[[p. 469]]</font>
numerous flower-sucking birds, aid in the fertilization of flowers whose corollas or stamens are
proportionately large.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I have now concluded this sketch of the general phenomena of colour in the organic world. I
have shown reasons for believing that its presence, in some of its infinitely-varied hues, is more
probable than its absence, and that variation of colour is an almost necessary concomitant of
variation of structure, of development, and of growth. It has also been shown how colour has
been appropriated and modified both in the animal and vegetable world, for the advantage of the
species in a great variety of ways, and that there is no need to call in the aid of any other laws
than those of organic development and &quot;natural selection&quot; to explain its countless modifications.
From the point of view here taken it seems at once improbable and unnecessary that the lower
animals should have the same delicate appreciation of the infinite variety and beauty--of the
delicate contrasts and subtle harmonies of colour--which are possessed by the more intellectual
races of mankind, since even the lower human races do not possess it. All that seems required in
the case of animals, is a perception of <em>distinctness</em> or <em>contrast</em> of colours; and the dislike of so
many creatures to scarlet may perhaps be due to the rarity of that colour in nature, and to the
glaring contrast it offers to the sober greens and browns which form the general clothing of the
earth's surface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The general view of the subject now given must convince us that, so far from colour
being--as it has sometimes been thought to be--unimportant, it is intimately connected with the
very existence of a large proportion of the species of the animal and vegetable worlds. The gay
colours of the butterfly and of the alpine flower which it unconsciously fertilises while seeking
for its secreted honey, are each beneficial to its possessor, and have been shown to be dependent
on the same class of general laws as those which have determined the form, the structure, and the
habits of every living thing. The complex laws and unexpected relations which we have seen to
be involved in the production of the special colours of flower, bird, and insect, must give them an
additional interest for every thoughtful mind; while the knowledge that, in all probability, each
style of coloration, and sometimes the smallest details, have a meaning and a use, must add a new
charm to the study of nature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Throughout the preceding discussion we have accepted the subjective phenomena of
colour--that is, our perception of varied hues, and the mental emotions excited by them--as
ultimate facts needing no explanation. Yet they present certain features well worthy of attention,
a brief consideration of which will form a fitting sequel to the present essay.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The perception of colour seems, to the present writer, the most wonderful and the most
mysterious of our sensations. Its extreme diversities and exquisite beauties seem out of
proportion to the causes that are supposed to have produced them, or the physical needs to which
they minister. If we look at pure tints of red, green, blue, and yellow, they appear so absolutely
contrasted and unlike each other, that it is almost impossible to believe (what we nevertheless
know to be the fact) that the rays of light producing these very distinct sensations differ only in
wave-length and rate of vibration; and that there is from one to the other a continuous series and
gradation of such vibrating waves. The positive diversity we see in them must then depend upon
special adaptations in ourselves; and the question arises--for what purpose have our visual
organs and mental perceptions become so highly specialised in this respect? When the sense of
sight was first developed in the animal kingdom, we can hardly doubt that <font color="990000">[[p. 470]]</font> what was
perceived was light only, and its more or less complete withdrawal. As the sense became
perfected, more delicate gradations of light and shade would be perceived; and there seems no
reason why a visual capacity might not have been developed as perfect as our own, or even more
so, in respect of light and shade, but entirely insensible to differences of colour, except in so far
as these implied a difference in the quantity of light. The world would in that case appear
somewhat as we see it in good stereoscopic photographs; and we all know how exquisitely
beautiful such pictures are, and how completely they give us all requisite information as to form,
surface-texture, solidity, and distance, and even to some extent as to colour; for almost all
colours are distinguishable in a photograph by some differences of tint, and it is quite
conceivable that visual organs might exist which would differentiate what we term colour by
delicate gradations of some one characteristic neutral tint. Now such a capacity of vision would
be simple as compared with that which we actually possess; which, besides distinguishing
infinite gradations of the <em>quantity</em> of light, distinguishes also, by a totally distinct set of
sensations, gradations of <em>quality</em>, as determined by differences of wave-lengths or rate of
vibration. At what grade in animal development this new and more complex sense first began to
appear we have no means of determining. The fact that the higher vertebrates, and even some
insects, distinguish what are to us diversities of colour, by no means proves that their <em>sensations</em>
of colour bear any resemblance whatever to ours. An insect's capacity to distinguish red from
blue or yellow may be (and probably is) due to perceptions of a totally distinct nature, and quite
unaccompanied by any of that sense of enjoyment or even of radical distinctness which pure
colours excite in us. Mammalia and birds, whose structure and emotions are so similar to our
own, do probably receive somewhat similar impressions of colour; but we have no evidence to
show that they experience pleasurable emotions from colour itself when not associated with the
satisfaction of their wants or the gratification of their passions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The primary necessity which led to the development of the sense of colour, was probably the
need of distinguishing objects much alike in form and size, but differing in important
properties;--such as ripe and unripe, or eatable and poisonous fruits; flowers with honey or
without; the sexes of the same or of closely-allied species. In most cases the strongest contrast
would be the most useful, especially as the colours of the objects to be distinguished would form
but minute spots or points when compared with the broad masses of tint of sky, earth, or foliage
against which they would be set. Throughout the long epochs in which the sense of sight was
being gradually developed in the higher animals, their visual organs would be mainly subjected
to two groups of rays--the green from vegetation, and the blue from the sky. The immense
preponderance of these over all other groups of rays would naturally lead the eye to become
specially adapted for their perception; and it is quite possible that at first these were the only
kinds of light-vibrations which could be perceived at all. When the need for differentiation of
colour arose, rays of greater and of smaller wave-lengths would necessarily be made use of to
excite the new sensations required; and we can thus understand why green and blue form the
central portion of the visible spectrum, and are the colours which are most agreeable to us in
large surfaces; while at its two extremities we find yellow, red, and violet, colours which we best
appreciate in smaller masses, and when contrasted with the other two or with light neutral tints.
We have here probably the foundations of a natural theory of harmonious colouring, derived
from the order in which our colour-sensations have <font color="990000">[[p. 471]]</font> arisen, and the nature of the
emotions with which the several tints have been always associated.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> The agreeable and soothing
influence of green light may be in part due to the green rays having little heating power; but this
can hardly be the chief cause, for the blue and violet, though they contain less heat, are not
generally felt to be so cool and sedative. But when we consider how dependent are all the higher
animals on vegetation, and that man himself has been developed in the closest relation to it, we
shall find, probably, a sufficient explanation. The green mantle with which the earth is
overspread caused this one colour to predominate over all others that meet our sight, and to be
almost always associated with the satisfaction of human wants. Where the grass is greenest, and
vegetation most abundant and varied, there has man always found his most suitable dwelling-place. In such spots hunger and thirst are unknown, and the choicest productions of nature gratify
the appetite and please the eye. In the greatest heats of summer, coolness, shade, and moisture
are found in the green forest glades; and we can thus understand how our visual apparatus has
become especially adapted to receive pleasurable and soothing sensations from this class of rays.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The preceding considerations enable us to comprehend, both why a perception of difference
of colour has become developed in the higher animals, and also why colours require to be
presented or combined in varying proportions in order to be agreeable to us. But they hardly
seem to afford a sufficient explanation, either of the wonderful contrasts and total unlikeness of
the sensations produced in us by the chief primary colours, or of the exquisite charm and
pleasure we derive from colour itself, as distinguished from variously coloured objects, in the
case of which association of ideas comes into play. It is hardly conceivable that the material <em>uses</em>
of colour to animals and to ourselves required such very distinct and powerfully-contrasted
sensations; and it is still less conceivable that a sense of delight in colour <em>per se</em> should have been
necessary for our utilization of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The emotions excited by colour and by music, alike, seem to rise above the level of a world
developed on purely utilitarian principles.</p>

<p><br /><em>Notes Appearing in the Original Work</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="-1"><a name="1" id="1"></a>1. It may be objected that most of the plants named are choice cultivated <em>varieties</em>, far surpassing in
colour the original stock, while the tropical plants are mostly unvaried wild <em>species</em>. But this does not really
much affect the question at issue. For our florists' gorgeous varieties have all been produced under the
influence of our cloudy skies, and with even a still further deficiency of light, owing to the necessity of
protecting them under glass from our sudden changes of temperature; so that they are themselves an
additional proof that tropical light and heat are not needed for the production of intense and varied colour.
Another important consideration is, that these cultivated <em>varieties</em> in many cases displace a number of wild
<em>species</em> which are hardly, if at all, cultivated. Thus there are scores of <em>species</em> of wild hollyhocks varying in
colour almost as much as the cultivated varieties, and the same may be said of the pentstemons,
rhododendrons, and many other flowers; and if these were all brought together in well-grown specimens,
they would produce a grand effect. But it is far easier, and more profitable, for our nurserymen to grow
<em>varieties</em> of one or two species, which all require a very similar culture, rather than fifty distinct <em>species</em>,
most of which would require special treatment; the result being that the varied beauty of the temperate flora
is even now hardly known, except to botanists and to a few amateurs. <font color="990000">[[on p. 387]]</font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="-1"><a name="4" id="4"></a>4. In the first part of this paper I used the term &quot;voluntary sexual-selection&quot; to indicate the theory that
many of the ornaments of male animals have been produced by the choice of the females, and to
distinguish it from that form of sexual selection which explains the acquisition of weapons peculiar to male
animals as due to the selective influence of their combats and struggles for the possession of the females. I
find that Mr. Darwin thinks the term &quot;voluntary&quot; not strictly applicable, and I therefore propose to alter it
to &quot;conscious&quot; or &quot;perceptive,&quot; which seem free from any ambiguity and make not the least difference to
my argument. <font color="990000">[[on p. 464]]</font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="-1"><a name="9" id="9"></a>9. There is reason to believe that our capacity of distinguishing colours has increased even in historical
times. The subject has attracted the attention of German philologists, and I have been furnished by a friend
with some notes from a work of the late Lazarus Geiger, entitled, <em>Zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der
Menschheit</em> (Stuttgart, 1871). According to this writer it appears that the <em>colour</em> of grass and foliage is
never alluded to as a beauty in the Vedas or the Zendavesta, though these productions are continually
extolled for other properties. Blue is described by terms denoting sometimes green, sometimes black,
showing that it was hardly recognised as a distinct colour. The <em>colour</em> of the sky is never mentioned in the
Bible, the Vedas, the Homeric poems, or even in the Koran. The first distinct allusion to it known to Geiger
is in an Arabic work of the ninth century. &quot;Hyacinthine locks&quot; are black locks, and Homer calls iron
&quot;violet-coloured.&quot; Yellow was often confounded with green, but, along with red, it was one of the earliest
colours to receive a distinct name. Aristotle names three colours in the rainbow--red, yellow, and green.
Two centuries earlier Xenophanes had described the rainbow as purple, reddish, and yellow. The
Pythagoreans admitted four primary colours--white, black, red, and yellow; the Chinese the same with the
addition of green. If these statements fairly represent the early condition of colour-sensation they well
accord with the view here maintained, that green and blue were first alone perceived, and that the other
colours were successively separated from them. These latter would be the first to receive names; hence we
find purple, reddish, and yellow, first noticed in the rainbow as the tints to be separated from the
widespread blue and green of the visible world which required no distinctive colour-appellation. If the
capacity of distinguishing colours has increased in historic times, we may perhaps look upon colour-blindness as a survival of a condition once almost universal; while the fact that it is still so prevalent is in
harmony with the view that our present high perception and appreciation of colour is a comparatively
recent acquisition, and may be correlated with a general advance in mental activity. <font color="990000">[[on p. 471]]</font></font></p>

<p>The "Art and Design" section of the Galaxy of Knowledge (<a href="http://www.sil.si.edu/galaxy/art.cfm">http://www.sil.si.edu/galaxy/art.cfm</a>) brings together content from the art and design collections of the Smithsonian Libraries. From the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum Library, selections include <i>Le Garde-meuble, ancien et moderne</i> (<i>Furniture repository, ancient and modern</i>).  Le Garde ... was a bimonthly periodical published in Paris which exerted an enormous influence on design throughout the world for nearly a century by promoting French styles in furniture, fabrics, and interior decoration. This site includes over 700 images from this influential publication. Other offerings from the Cooper-Hewitt Library collection include two small exhibitions, <i>Vibrant Visions: Pochoir Prints in the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum Library</i> and <i>Czech Book Covers of the 1920's and 1930's in the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum Library</i>.</p>


<p>Other "digital edition" highlights include William Mullingar Higgins' <i>The House Painter, or, Decorator's Companion</i> (1841). This work includes samples and recipes for creating a variety of faux finishes to imitate wood grains and marbling. <i>Drawing from Life</i> is a collection of caricatures and cartoons from the American Art/Portrait Gallery Library collections that includes works from William Hogarth to Charles Dana Gibson.</p>


<p>The art library collections of Smithsonian Libraries house important collections of print ephemera on art and artists. <i>Art &amp; Artist Files in the Smithsonian Libraries' Collections</i> is an ongoing project to provide artist name access to these collections located in the Smithsonian American Art/Portrait Gallery Library, the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum Library, Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery Library, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Library, and the Warren M. Robbins Library, National Museum of African Art. Over 53,400 artists are now represented in this database with new artists added daily. Artist files from other Smithsonian Libraries' collections, including the National Museum of the American Indian Library, will be added and over 100,000 names will eventually be represented.</p>

Visitors can browse images in any of 100 plus "collections", ranging from "advertisements" to "zoos" or search for images on keywords of their choosing. Images from the 15<sup>th</sup> through early 20<sup>th</sup> century are available from
the Art &amp; Design portion of the Galaxy of Knowledge as well as the rich
holdings in scientific illustration, American technology and industry, and
related fields.</p>

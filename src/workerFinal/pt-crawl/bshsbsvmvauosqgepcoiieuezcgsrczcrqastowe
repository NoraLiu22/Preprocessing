        gland?<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The hormones 
        produced by the thyroid gland aid in skin production and shedding, regulating 
        the metabolism, the energy and activity levels, growth, and temperament. 
        In other words, the thyroid is closely bound with many facets of the organism's 
        health and well being. I say &quot;organism&quot; because all animals 
        that have a thyroid gland are all affected similarly when it is working...and 
        when it is not. To help it function properly, the thyroid of all animals 
        needs sufficient amounts of iodine on a regular basis. To help ensure 
        humans get enough iodine, regular salt (table salt) has been &quot;enriched&quot; 
        with iodine, that is, iodine is added to it to help those who may not 
        otherwise be getting enough iodine in their regular diet. Fortunately, 
        feeding a properly constructed plant diet will provide all the iodine 
        an iguana needs - you never have to add iodized salt to their food!</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What is hypothyroidism?<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
        some plants contain goitrogens - compounds that bind the iodine in food, 
        preventing the body from utilizing it. This is easily dealt with by simply 
        not feeding your iguana a lot of those vegetables: broccoli, cabbage, 
        cauliflower, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, kale, soy (tofu), and grains. 
        Some of the chemicals found naturally occurring in plants that are known 
        to bind iodine include:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">anthocyanin</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">benzyl-thiocyanate 
          (a possible goitrogen)</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">goitrin</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">iodine</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">phloroglucinol</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">vitexin</font> </li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Some plants may have 
        just one goitrogen, while other plants may have more than one. Some have 
        very small amounts, while others have higher amounts. If you feed your 
        iguana plants that are high in goitrogens, and feed them regularly and 
        in quantity, your iguana's thyroid gland will not be able to get the iodine 
        it needs and so will start to suffer a decline, not putting out the various 
        hormones and chemicals your body needs. This is called hypo- (low) thyroid, 
        or hypothyroidism.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hypothyroidism 
        in iguanas leads to iguanas who are sluggish, lethargic, chubby but slow 
        growing, and generally very sweet natured without having had to work much 
        at being tamed. Keepers of such iguanas are amazed at the difference within 
        a couple of weeks after they eliminate the large quantities of goitrogenic 
        foods from their iguana's diet.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hyperthyroid, 
        a medical condition in which the thyroid becomes overactive, is uncommon 
        in iguanas. Symptoms may include overly rapid growth, thickened bones, 
        and a nervous, jittery temperament. (The latter symptoms should not be 
        confused with the normal behavior of an untamed or otherwise high-strung 
        iguana.)</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">You can 
        look up goitrogens in plants at the <a href="http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/">Phytochemical 
        and Ethnobotanical Databases</a> site. Keep in mind, please, that not 
        every plant is in the database, only ones that the US Agricultural Research 
        Service has already analyzed and entered the data into the databases. 
        Thus, some common food plants may be missing, as will plants commonly 
        fed to food and other domestic animals.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What 
        causes it?<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Goitrogenic 
        foods are those which contain iodine binders. When the body cannot get 
        enough iodine, a goiter forms, which impairs thyroid function, causing 
        hypothyroidism. Feeding goitrogenic foods as a significant part of the 
        diet, human and iguana, can thus lead to hypothyroidism. This leads to 
        reduced activity levels, reduced metabolic rate, muscle and joints aches 
        and pains, and we know in humans (and, from personal experience, dogs) 
        it also causes moderate to severe headaches, vision problems, and hair 
        loss, as well as a host of other systems.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 
        plant parts most commonly fed, the plants with problematic levels of one 
        or more goitrogens:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Cabbages (Red, white, 
          etc.) (<i>Brassica oleracea var. capitata l. var. capitata </i>L.)</font></li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Garden cress (<i>Lepidium 
          sativum</i>) </font></li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Grapes (<i>Vitis 
          vinifera</i>)</font></li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Kale (curly kale, 
          Kitchen kale, Scotch kale) (<i>Brassica oleracea var. sabellica l. var. 
          acephala</i> DC)</font></li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Mango (<i>Mangifera 
          indica</i>) </font></li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Pea (<i>Pisum sativum)</i></font></li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Some plants 
        have both iodine and iodine-binders, such as:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Kelp (<i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>)</font></li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Soybean (<i>Glycine 
          max</i>) </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Like spinach, 
        which has both calcium and calcium oxalate, the goitrogen in kelp, for 
        example, may be enough to bind the iodine it contains and other iodine 
        in the diet.</font></p>
      <div align="left"> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">It is also important 
          to note that I have not been able to locate data on all plants. It is 
          known that broccoli and cauliflower can affect thyroid hormone levels 
          so they do have goitrogens in them. The source I use most extensively, 
          the Duke University Agricultural Research Service's <a href="http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/">Phytochemical 
          &amp; Ethnobotanical Database</a>, does not have information on many 
          of the Brassica.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">As when dealing with 
          food choices and oxalates, it is important to weigh the overall importance 
          of a plant food against the overall diet. Diets that contain staples 
          which include regular and significant quantities of broccoli and kale, 
          for example, are going to provide sufficient amounts of goitrogenic 
          chemicals to cause hypothyroidism. Goitrogenic foods can be fed, but 
          do so in moderation, and use foods lacking or containing very low levels 
          of goitrogens as dietary staples, leaving the others for occasional 
          treats.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What hypothyroidism 
          and goitrogens are not.</b></font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hypothyroidism and 
          goitrogens have nothing to do with calcium deficiency (<a href="../mbd2.html">metabolic 
          bone disease</a>), the mineralization of soft tissues (due to high levels 
          of calcium oxalates or oxalic acid intake), <a href="../thiamine.html">thiamine

      </div>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Calcium 
        oxalate binds calcium, not iodine. When the body does not have sufficient 
        calcium to both maintain bone density (and to grow bones in young animals, 
        or develop eggs properly in gravid females), bones become less dense - 
        like a sponge grown more holey. Since calcium is used throughout the body, 
        by the cardiopulmonary system, gastrointestinal tract, the brain, and 
        other organs and systems, hypocalcemia (calcium deficiency) can be very 
        serious if not diagnosed and treated promptly, and the underlying conditions 
        which caused it, corrected.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Soy, and food products 
          made from soy (tofu, tempeh, soy nuggets, soy milk, soy yogurt, soy 
          cheese, edemame, etc.) contains fat (impedes calcium uptake), goitrogens 
          (impedes iodine uptake), and oxalates--as much in a 1/2 cup of tofu 
          as in 1/2 cup of spinach (over 200 mg). (Source: <a href="http://www.ohf.org">OHF,

      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">In the 
        case of gravid females, if a female is tested and shows serum calcium 
        within the normal range, she is in fact hypocalcemic - she will not have 
        enough calcium to support her own body's requirements as well as those 
        of her developing embryos and will not be able to make shells for them. 
        The serum levels are &quot;normal&quot; because the calcium is being mobilized 
        from her bones to service her systemic needs. Once the bones have been 
        stripped, she will die. In a healthy animal whose Ca:P:D3 is in good shape, 
        the calcium normally lifted from the bone but is then redeposited into 
        the bone so the bone doesn't get porous. In a situation where there is 
        insufficient calcium, and so there isn't enough for the bones and the 
        rest of the body, it is usually the bones that are affected first - which 
        is why most people associate MBD with swollen long bones or jaws...when 
        in fact reduced appetite and constipation are also signs of severe to 
        advanced MBD. A healthy gravid female who has sufficient calcium for her 
        body's needs and those of her developing eggs will test out as being slightly 
        hypercalcemic. In the case of a gravid female, this is good and desirable.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Kidney 
        function is not directly affected by goitrogenic foods or metabolic bone 
        disease. They can be affected by high calcium oxalate intake as oxalates 
        will causes crystals in the kidneys just as easily as it mineralizes the 
        heart, lungs, liver, muscles and joints, but it does not target the kidneys. 
        As more of the healthy organ and muscle tissue is replaced or interspersed 
        with these crystals, the organ function starts to decline - in advanced 
        cases, they may cease functioning altogether or be impaired to such an 
        extent that they can no longer contribute to homeostasis (health) and 
        so the animal falls ill. If the organ function cannot be restored, or 
        the degeneration halted when there is still enough left to support sufficient 
        functioning, the animal dies.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Kidneys 
        are also affected by the body's fluid volume. Low volume = dehydration 
        = impaired kidney function. If sustained over the long term, it causes 
        kidney failure. This problem can be compounded in iguanas and other reptiles 
        through the use of antibiotics, many of which are already hard on the 
        kidneys. Without enough fluids in the body to keep the kidneys well flushed, 
        kidney damage will occur...leading to a potential for kidney failure. 
        Fluid volume has nothing to do with oxalates nor with goitrogens and hypothyroidism.</font></p>

        </b>There is a nonfat tofu cake available that would be great for use 
        except for the other problem associated with tofu. Tofu contains goitrogens, 
        phytocompounds which interfere with the thyroid gland's uptake of iodine 
        from the diet. Over time (and it may be a period of several months, depending 
        on how much other highly goitrogenic foods are being fed), the thyroid

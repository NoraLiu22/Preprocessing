<p align=justify><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Wonder Wizard</b> and <b>Gulliver
</b>were trademarks used by <b>General Home Products</b> for selling video games
manufactured by <b>Magnavox</b>.
<BR><BR>
The first game in the line was called <b>Triple Challenge (model 7701)</b> and
sold under the <b>Gulliver</b> trademark. All later models were sold under the
Wonder Wizard trademark. One of the most interesting is model 7702. It was sold
in 1976 and contains a <a href="odyssey_other.htm">Magnavox Odyssey 300</a>
circuit board housed into a derivate of the <a href="odyssey.htm">1972 Odyssey</a>
case. The bottom part of the case is identical, only the top differs and was made
in two versions: one with silver knobs and woodgrain only in the section containing
the  "Wonder Wizard" name, and one (as pictured) with black knobs and woodgrain 
everywhere. Like Odyssey 300, this system used a 3-position switch to choose one 
of three predefined combinations of difficulties, avoiding the need to change the 
ball speed, ball angle and bat size separately. Few systems used this design and
most others used individual skill level switches.
<BR><BR>
The <b>Bulls Eye (model 7704)</b> and <b>Sharp Shooter (model 7705)</b> had a rather
unique small metal case allowing them to be attached on a side of the TV set.
Both used the General Instruments <a href="gi.htm">AY-3-8500</a>chip, came with a
light gun and played the six games of the chip. The only difference is that Model 7704
played the games in black and white, whereas model 7705 played them in color.
<BR><BR>
The <b>Scoreboard (model 7706)</b> was a clone of the 1976 Gamatic 7600 (Japan),
which was sold under various brands all over the world (Univox in France, Intel in 
Germany -short name of Interelectric-, Grandstand in England, etc.)
<BR><BR>
The <b>model 7709</b> apparently closed the line. It was designed in a flat case
with a similar decoration as model 7702; it played the six games of the AY-3-8500 chip. 
Although the picture below indicates that at least a prototype existed for that 
model, no specimen has been reported so far. However, David Winter rediscovered 
an almost same model made by Beta Electronic Inc.: the Davitronix model 7N. The 
story behind these games remains unknown, especially whether Wonder Wizard used 
a foreign design or even copied it, or vice-versa. The specimen came from Thailand,
where it could have been sold.<br>
<br>
Finally, David Winter discovered an unreleased model in a 1976 sales brochure:
<b>Desert Fox (model 7707)</b>, a <b>Tank Battle</b> system designed around the
General Instruments <a href="gi.htm">AY-3-8700 chip</a>. It played four games.<br>
Two mysteries remain so far: models 7703 and 7708. No information exists about them,
so all rumors are possible, ranging from a different Ball and Paddle chip design to
a later design like Breakout, Motocross, etc.<br><br><br>

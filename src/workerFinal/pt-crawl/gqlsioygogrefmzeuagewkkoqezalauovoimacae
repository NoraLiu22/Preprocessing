<p>Famously, producer Carlo Ponti was disappointed that Jean-Luc Godard’s adaptation of the Alberto Moravia’s novel A Ghost at Noon contained no nude shots of star Brigitte Bardot. With typical perversity, Godard compromised by adding an explicit scene of Camille (Bardot) naked on a bed as screenwriter-husband Paul (Michel Piccoli) lists her attractive features. The anecdote is appropriate for a film that features an American film producer (Jack Palance) exerting his crass influence over the Grecian epic being made by German genius Fritz Lang (playing himself).</p>

<p>While filled with playful cinematic references, Le Mépris is perhaps Godard’s most emotionally direct film, particularly intense in the long central apartment scene – masterfully shot by Raoul Coutard – in which the fractures in Paul and Camille’s marriage come to seem irreversible.</p>

<p>“Godard’s finest film is a deeply cynical study of the loss of artistic integrity and the loss of respect that comes from it, a warning to every artist who chooses to sell out for financial gain.” <strong>David Flint</strong></p>

<p>“The ideal balance between a Godard work’s self-reflexivity and its penchant for the elegiac and transcendent. It’s at once a send-up of the institution of cinema and, somehow, a meditation on love and art’s profound mysteries.” <strong>Rielle Navitski</strong></p>

<p>“The schematic beauty of the colours and the detached acting of the actors, in contrast to the lyricism of the music, make Le Mépris an obsessive story.” <strong>François Jost</strong></p>

With typical perversity, Godard compromised by adding an explicit scene of Camille (Bardot) naked on a bed as screenwriter-husband Paul (Michel Piccoli) lists her attractive features. The anecdote is appropriate for a film that features an American film producer (Jack Palance) exerting his crass influence over the Grecian epic being made by German genius Fritz Lang (playing himself).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While filled with playful cinematic references, Le Mépris is perhaps Godard’s most emotionally direct film, particularly intense in the long central apartment scene – masterfully shot by Raoul Coutard – in which the fractures in Paul and Camille’s marriage come to seem irreversible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Godard’s finest film is a deeply cynical study of the loss of artistic integrity and the loss of respect that comes from it, a warning to every artist who chooses to sell out for financial gain.” <strong>David Flint</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The ideal balance between a Godard work’s self-reflexivity and its penchant for the elegiac and transcendent. It’s at once a send-up of the institution of cinema and, somehow, a meditation on love and art’s profound mysteries.” <strong>Rielle Navitski</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The schematic beauty of the colours and the detached acting of the actors, in contrast to the lyricism of the music, make Le Mépris an obsessive story.” <strong>François Jost</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Jean-Luc Godard","producer":"Georges de Beauregard, Carlo Ponti","writer":"Jean-Luc Godard","featuring":"Brigitte Bardot, Michel Piccoli, Jack Palance"},"year":"1963","nameAndYear":"Le Mépris (1963)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-le-mepris-1963-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-le-mepris-1963-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/661","pillar":"rentals","price":2.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"France, Italy","runningTime":103,"sightAndSound":{"results":[{"position":54,"tied":true,"category":"critics"},{"position":46,"tied":true,"category":"directors"}],"voters":{"critics":[{"firstname":"Saleem","surname":"Albeik","slug":"saleem-albeik","name":"Saleem Albeik","sortName":"Albeik, Saleem","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Critic","country":"Palestine/France","remarks":[{"type":"p","key":"Like many other cinephiles, I believe, once I discovered this poll, long years ago, I made myself a task of watching and studying these 100 great films.

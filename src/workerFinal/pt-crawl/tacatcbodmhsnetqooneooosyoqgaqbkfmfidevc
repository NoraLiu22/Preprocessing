/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: A scathing 
        book review of Charles R. Bree's <u>An Exposition of Fallacies in the 
        Hypothesis of Mr. Darwin</u> that appeared in the 25 July 1872 number 
        of the journal <u>Nature</u>. Original pagination indicated within double

<p><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 237]]</font> This 
        volume, which in bulk, general appearance, and typography bears a close 
        resemblance to the earlier editions of the &quot;Origin of Species,&quot; seems 
        got up to stand by its side on the bookshelf, an ever ready antidote to 
        the pernicious doctrines of Mr. Darwin and his supporters. After a careful 
        perusal we must confess that it may seriously damage Mr. Darwin's reputation 
        with those who have never read his works; but we are quite sure that no 
        one who has studied the &quot;Origin of Species,&quot; and been convinced of the 
        general accuracy of its statements and conclusions, will have their convictions 
        at all shaken by Dr. Bree's argument. As, however, it is just the work 
        to be read by those who have only a second-hand knowledge of Mr. Darwin's 
        works, we feel it to be a duty to call attention to the very careless 
        manner in which the book is written,--its numerous errors, misrepresentations, 
        and misconceptions, and its extensive use of declamation and opinion as 
        sufficient answers to Mr. Darwin's elaborate observations, carefully selected 
        facts, and cautious inductions.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a work of purely adverse criticism, the first 
        duty of an author is to quote his opponent's words with scrupulous accuracy. 
        Yet, in the very first page of his book, Dr. Bree misquotes Dr. Hooker; 
        at p. 3 and again at p. 9 he repeats this misquotation; and he devotes 
        eight pages to proving that what Dr. Hooker did not say is erroneous. 
        The quotation is from the Presidential Address at Norwich. The words actually 
        used, and to be found in the authoritative report, are:--&quot;So far from 
        Natural Selection being a thing of the past, it is an accepted doctrine 
        with <em>almost</em> every philosophical naturalist; including, it will 
        always be understood, a considerable proportion who are not prepared to 
        assent that it accounts for all that Mr. Darwin assigns to it.&quot; Dr. Bree 
        omits the word <em>almost,</em> and then sets himself to convict Dr. Hooker 
        of misrepresentation, by showing that with <em>some</em> &quot;philosophical 
        naturalists&quot; it is not an accepted doctrine.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On p. 2 Dr. Bree makes a misstatement, almost 
        equally glaring, of another author's view. He says, &quot;And Mr. St. George 
        Mivart has proved, and I think incontestably, that it (Natural Selection) 
        <em>has not a</em> <em>basis of truth</em>;&quot; and refers the reader to 
        &quot;Genesis of Species,&quot; 1871. But in this volume we find (at p. 5) the author's 
        statement, that the object of his book is &quot;to maintain the position that 
        'Natural Selection' <em>acts, and, indeed, must act,</em> but that still, 
        in order that we may be able to account for the production of known kinds 
        of animals and plants, it requires to be supplemented by the action of 
        some other natural law or laws yet to be discovered.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little further on Dr. Bree discusses Herbert 
        Spencer's &quot;First Principles;&quot; and how far he is likely to elucidate that 
        philosopher's views may be seen by the following curious blunder. At p. 
        48 he tries to explain to his readers what Spencer means by &quot;the integration 
        of matter,&quot; and quotes the following passage from his &quot;First Principles:&quot;--</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Every mass, from a grain of sand to a planet, 
        radiates heat to other masses, and absorbs heat radiated by other masses; 
        and in so far as it does the one it becomes integrated, while in so far 
        as it does the other it becomes disintegrated.&quot;</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Bree appears to have been afraid that his 
        readers would hardly be of sufficient mental calibre to comprehend this 
        passage. He therefore elucidates it as follows: &quot;Integration of matter, 
        therefore, is the absorption of heat, and heat, we are told by Tyndall, 
        endorsed by Spencer, is 'tremulous motion'--therefore, integration of 
        matter is the absorption of motion.&quot; We think Dr. Bree has hardly done 
        justice to his readers by merely turning Spencer's statement topsy-turvy, 
        and showing them that a &quot;good rule will work both ways;&quot; he should further 
        have illustrated the subject by what that philosopher terms a concrete 
        example, and explained that, in his view, water is <em>integrated</em>, 
        when, by absorbing heat, it changes into steam, and <em>disintegrated 
        </em>when by radiating heat it becomes solid ice!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the supposed fallacies of such men as Hooker 
        and Spencer, who, in Dr. Bree's opinion, are mere satellites of Darwin, 
        and thus ruthlessly exposed, we can hardly expect the chief conspirator 
        himself to receive much mercy. In his &quot;Animals and Plants under Domestication,&quot; 
        vol. ii. pp. 250-255, Mr. Darwin carefully discusses the various views 
        as to the causes of variability, and arrives at the conclusion that variability 
        is <em>not</em> an ultimate fact necessarily contingent on reproduction 
        (p. 253), and that variability of every kind is directly or indirectly 
        caused by changed conditions of life (p. 255). Dr. Bree, however, referring 
        to the same chapter of the same work, gives his view of the writer's meaning 
        in the following passage:--&quot;But Mr. Darwin goes further. He says there 
        is an inherent tendency in the constitution of the organism to vary, independent 
        of, but modified by, its conditions.&quot; At p. 191 Dr. Bree states, as if 
        on Mr. Darwin's authority, &quot;that tortoise-shell cats are so coloured as 
        a rule only in the males;&quot; and at p. 192, that Mr. Darwin &quot;does not believe&quot; 
        exactly what Mr. Darwin says he does believe. But these are only errors 
        of the pen in the haste of argumentative composition; a less excusable 
        mistake is made at p. 212, where, after quoting a passage from Mr. Darwin 
        about mimicry, Dr. Bree says:--&quot;This passage implies that an insect can 
        imitate the organisation of another insect, by means of a knowledge that 
        such organisation is safer from enemies than that in which nature had 
        clothed it. A more unsound, unphilosophical, unproved, reckless statement 
        is not to be found, &amp;c. &amp;c . . . It is only just to say that the 
        above theory did not originate with Mr. Darwin. It is the <em>sole production</em> 
        of the fertile brain of <em>Mr. Wallace.</em>&quot; Here we have a misrepresentation 
        and a misstatement. No expression of Mr. Darwin or myself can be taken 
        to mean that we believed in a voluntary knowing imitation of the organisation 
        of one insect by another. In my article on &quot;Mimicry&quot; I have expressly 
        disclaimed this view. As to the latter part of the quotation, the first 
        words of Mr. Darwin's paragraph headed &quot;Mimicry,&quot; and which Dr. Bree must 
        have had before his eyes, are:--&quot;This principle was first made clear in 
        an admirable paper by <em>Mr. Bates</em>!&quot; A little farther on, my <font color="990000">[[p. 
        238]]</font> theory of birds' nests and the colour of female birds is 
        noticed with strong disapproval; and a crushing array of facts is adduced 
        as being opposed to my statement that &quot;when both sexes are coloured in 
        a strikingly conspicuous manner the nest is of such a nature as to conceal 
        the sitting bird.&quot; The whitethroat, thrush, snipe, skylark, and hedge-sparrow 
        are adduced as opposed to my views; but as they must all be coloured in 
        a <em>strikingly conspicuous </em>manner if they are to be of any use 
        to Dr. Bree or his hypothetical schoolboy, the reason why they are cited 
        remains a mystery to me. Two pages farther on we have more misquotations 
        or blunders. At p. 229 we are told that Nitzsch's &quot;feather tracts&quot; are 
        those parts of the body which have the skin uncovered! while at p. 230 
        we find that it is the brilliant rays <em>absorbed</em> by feathers that 
        produce the vivid, varied, and beautiful colouring of birds! At p. 259 
        it is stated that &quot;inconceivably minute changes&quot; are alone utilised by 
        natural selection--a misrepresentation which no word of mine or Mr. Darwin's 
        will justify. At p. 261 we have this passage:--&quot;Mr. Wallace adopts Mr. 
        Darwin's view, that there is no such thing as instinct at all, in the 
        sense in which we understand the word. He considers it the 'result of 
        small contingent consequences, as produced by natural selection.'&quot; As 
        the &quot;he&quot; in this sentence appears to refer to Mr. Wallace, and the last 
        ten words are given as a quotation, I felt rather ashamed of myself for 
        writing what I could not the least understand. But a careful examination 
        of my paper shows me that I have said nothing about the &quot;result of contingent 
        consequences;&quot; neither can I find anything of the kind in Mr. Darwin's 
        writings on &quot;instinct.&quot; We must pass it over, therefore, as one of the 
        ingenious paraphrases by which Dr. Bree endeavours to elucidate a difficult 
        subject.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a large folded frontispiece we have &quot;The Descent 
        of Man, after Darwin's Theory,&quot; and this is explained at p. 325; but here, 
        too, Mr. Darwin has not been read aright, for &quot;man's ancient ancestor, 
        with cocked ears, tail, prehensile feet, both sexes bearded and hirsute, 
        males with great canine teeth,&quot; is placed between Marsupials and Lemurs, 
        whereas Darwin places it after the origin of the catarrhine monkeys, in 
        fact, at Fig. 15 of Dr. Bree's diagram. Our author makes a great point 
        of this, and says:--&quot;From such a Darwinian creation were descended the 
        lowest of the quadrumana, the lemurs.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At p. 331 we have another of our author's enigmatical 
        sentences:--&quot;If an optician makes an object-glass, he does so in reference 
        to the objective, the lens.&quot; I had previously imagined that the objective 
        <em>was</em> the object-glass; but at p. 351 I was still more puzzled 
        by reference to the &quot;final law of the pendulum&quot; and the &quot;final law of 
        the screw&quot;--two things I had never before heard of.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think we have now shown that this book contains 
        so large a number of errors, misrepresentations, and misconceptions as 
        to render it quite untrustworthy. We proceed to give a few instances of 
        the author's copious use of declamation, assertion, and opinion, of doubtful 
        facts and illogical arguments.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of declamation and assertion we have an abundance, 
        the following being a favourable specimen:--&quot;The system of Darwin is eminently 
        illogical, and must fall. It is an hypothesis which draws large but unsound 
        deductions from the rare and abnormal deviations, leaving the real field 
        untouched and unexplored. It is founded upon the exceptions, not the rules 
        of nature. It is utterly opposed to design, to the teachings of animal 
        mechanics, to the grand and beautiful and everlasting proofs upon which 
        the teleologist loves to dwell. It is a cold, unsound, unphilosophic, 
        degrading system of assumed probabilities, which, if true, would be ten 
        times more wonderful than anything assumed or believed by the most strict 
        and rigid disciple of special creation. Nay, still further, if proved 
        in every point to be true, it would still leave the fact of special creation 
        in all its wonderful mystery. The organic cannot be formed from the inorganic; 
        nor could the organic, if it were so formed, be endowed by any physical 
        force with the laws and properties of life. Go on still in speculation, 
        and I ask, Whence the inorganic--its beginning, its ending, its grand 
        and inexplicable laws, which the physicist in vain attempts to correlate 
        with the vital? Whence gravitation, and what? the sidereal system and 
        its movements? the Spirit that breathes through illimitable space, and 
        lives through an eternity of time?&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large portion of the volume is occupied with 
        quotations from Agassiz, Haughton, Flourens, Owen, and other opponents 
        of Darwinism; and Dr. Bree complains that these authors have hardly been 
        noticed and not replied to by Darwin or his supporters. But the reason 
        of this is explained in the pages of the present work (where we may suppose 
        their best passages are quoted), by the almost entire absence of argument 
        directed to the essential points of Mr. Darwin's theories, and the immense 
        preponderance of loose assertions, in support of which no evidence is 
        given. Thus, Agassiz asserts that &quot;the differences&quot; among domestic animals 
        &quot;are not of the same kind as the differences we observe among wild animals;&quot; 
        that &quot;the differences we observe among wild animals are the result of 
        a <em>creative power</em>;&quot; that &quot;domestication <em>never</em> produces 
        forms which are self-perpetuating;&quot; that &quot;<em>at all times</em> the world 
        has been inhabited by as great a diversity of animals as exists now;&quot; 
        and other similar assertions, almost all of which are controverted by 
        accumulated facts in the works of Mr. Darwin. Chapter xxviii. is entirely 
        devoted to an account of Agassiz's views of design, and supposed <em>proofs</em> 
        of a creative mind at work in every step of the development of a group 
        of animals. The facts will appear to most naturalists thoroughly consistent 
        with the theory of evolution and that of natural selection; while the 
        arguments involve a view of the Deity which most philosophical thinkers 
        will find it hard to accept. Agassiz compares the Creator to an engineer, 
        and speaks of Him as &quot;<em>constantly</em> and <em>thoughtfully working</em> 
        among the <em>complicated</em> <em>structures</em> that He has made.&quot; 
        The idea is not that of an <em>omniscient</em> Creator, but of some inferior 
        being with an intellect vastly superior to man's, but yet limited. &quot;<em>Thoughtfully 
        working</em>&quot; implies effort to understand and overcome difficulties; 
        whereas <em>thought</em> at all, as we think, is utterly opposed to the 
        conception of omniscience.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another chapter is devoted to Prof. Haughton's 
        theory of &quot;Least Action in Nature;&quot; and here, again, all the established 
        facts are perfectly consistent with, and almost necessary deductions from, 
        evolution and natural <font color="990000">[[p. 239]]</font> selection. 
        But it is the mere wide general assertions which Dr. Bree quotes with 
        greatest approval as destructive of Darwinism. Thus: &quot;There is no evidence 
        in nature of birds with imperfect wings; no proof of a succession of blunders 
        before perfection was attained. All is perfect, and all was always perfect.&quot; 
        And again: &quot;In every arrangement of bones, muscles, joints, and parts 
        of animals, the motion <em>must</em> be such as it would be on the hypothesis 
        that the muscles were a living, intelligent thing, trying to save itself 
        trouble.&quot; This last may be true, but it is certainly not necessarily true; 
        and as to imperfect wings, what are those of the Cassowary and Apteryx, 
        which have no known function whatever?</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article of M. Flourens against Darwin is 
        given in an appendix, and his facts as to the crossing of quadrupeds are 
        said to be absolutely fatal to the whole theory of natural selection. 
        But these facts are of a very imperfect and scanty character, and are 
        almost wholly negative; and they are fully noticed in Mr. Darwin's elaborate 
        discussion of the difficult question of hybridity, although Dr. Bree assures 
        his readers that these facts were &quot;never contradicted or <em>even noticed 
        by Mr. Darwin</em>!&quot; Under the heading &quot;Flourens,&quot; in the index to &quot;Animals 
        and Plants under Domestication,&quot; are four references, and the works, &quot;Long&eacute;vit&eacute; 
        Humaine&quot; and &quot;De l'Instinct,&quot; are referred to; while Dr. Bree himself 
        seems to be unaware of the existence of anything but the &quot;Criticism on 
        Darwin,&quot; which has been long ago most admirably answered by Prof. Huxley.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now give a few examples of the facts 
        and arguments adduced by Dr. Bree himself. At p. 90, he tells us that 
        Mr. Darwin &quot;has given figures of different sized skulls and jaw-bones, 
        scapul&aelig; and clavicles (of pigeons), differing just as much from 
        each other as the same bones in different sized Englishmen would do; and 
        nothing more!&quot; And on the next page he assures us that a Colchester pigeon-fancier 
        told him, that if he allowed his short-beaked tumblers to fly out of doors 
        they would revert to a state of nature, and that, <em>in a few weeks</em>, 
        the beautiful small beaks would be as long and as coarse as those of any 
        other bird! On which Dr. Bree triumphantly remarks--&quot;Of course they would.&quot; 
        At p. 131 he tells us, that although young song birds will learn other 
        birds' notes with which they may be associated, yet <em>if kept quite 
        alone</em> they will sing their own natural song, &quot;<em>as several who 
        have tried the experiment</em> <em>assure me</em>.&quot; This is directly opposed 
        to the experiments on this very point of Daines Barrington, quoted by 
        me in &quot;Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,&quot; 2nd Ed. p. 221, 
        and it would therefore have been a valuable contribution to our knowledge 
        of this difficult subject if the experiments alluded to had been given 
        in detail, not vaguely referred to. At p. 143 it is stated that the bees' 
        cell &quot;is one of the finest examples in nature of what is termed the principle 
        of 'least action;' that is to say, the greatest amount of space is gained 
        by the least amount of material.&quot; This is certainly not true, for the 
        cell being suspended from <em>the top</em> and <em>equally thick throughout</em>, 
        must be too strong at bottom if strong enough at top. There is therefore 
        waste of material. This objection was published nine years ago, in the 
        &quot;Annals of Natural History&quot; for October 1863, and it has never been answered.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the imperfection of the geological record 
        Dr. Bree is very strong. He says that Mr. Darwin &quot;asks us to imagine that 
        an ape-like man became evolved in the lower tertiaries, the remains of 
        which or of his descendants have never been discovered. Such a demand 
        upon the credulity of mankind was never, I believe, before seriously made, 
        unless we were told that geese were transmuted barnacles&quot; (p. 180). This 
        is, of course, a sufficient answer to Sir Charles Lyell's careful investigation 
        of the subject, and especially to his most suggestive table of old fossil 
        mammals, given in the twentieth chapter of his &quot;Elements of Geology.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mivart and Prof. Owen are both applauded 
        so far as they oppose Darwin, but as both of them believe in some form 
        of development, they are, in Dr. Bree's opinion, almost equally involved 
        in error. Mr. Mivart's doctrine of evolution, he thinks, cannot stand, 
        and &quot;looks too much like Mr. Tegetmeir's pigeons, made to order.&quot; It is, 
        however, no doubt offered with the best intentions, &quot;as a means of reconciling 
        scientific and religious thought,&quot;--&quot;two lines which, Mr. Spencer remarks, 
        are running parallel <em>and</em> gradually approaching each other!&quot; (We 
        doubt the accuracy of this quotation from Mr. Spencer, but we are near 
        the end of the book and have learnt not to expect accuracy.) Prof. Owen 
        has, in Dr. Bree's humble opinion, &quot;surrendered the outposts of our defence 
        to the believers in the Darwinian hypothesis.&quot; As to Sir Charles Lyell, 
        the charm of his works is gone for Dr. Bree, and he reflects with melancholy 
        what the future will think of the great geologist's transmutation of thought, 
        and with regret that such a man could, &quot;in the maturity of his age and 
        fame, have forsaken the 'principles' of his youth, of his manhood, and 
        of his prime.&quot; The researches of M. Gaudry in Greece are of no use whatever; 
        for the various forms of elephant, rhinoceros, horse, and pig, which he 
        and Sir Charles Lyell believe to be intermediate forms, differ no more 
        from one another than do English from Americans, and only prove a &quot;slight 
        variation!&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the kind of observations, this the 
        kind of reasoning, by which Dr. Bree thinks to stem the tide of belief 
        in Darwinism. At p. 269, Prof. Huxley is severely criticised for having 
        written the following passage: &quot;The mixture of ignorance and insolence 
        which <em>at first</em> characterised a large proportion of the attacks 
        with which Mr. Darwin was assailed, is no longer the sad distinction of 
        anti-Darwinism criticism.&quot; This, Dr. Bree, with his usual curious logic, 
        asserts is manifestly untrue, <em>because</em> some of the highest men 
        in science, such as Agassiz, Flourens, Owen, Haughton, &amp;c., oppose 
        Darwinism. Why then did Dr. Bree not let well alone--leave the battle 
        in the hands of these redoubted champions, and not give Prof. Huxley the 
        opportunity of retracting his statement, on the ground that although the 
        <em>insolence</em> of the first opponents of Darwinism may have vanished, 
        their <em>ignorance</em> has returned?</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I must again repeat that the 
        only reason for devoting so much space to a book so little worthy of its 
        title or its author, is the wish to warn such as are not well acquainted 
        with Mr. Darwin's works from implicitly relying either on Dr. Bree's facts 
        and arguments, or on the accuracy of his representation of those of Mr. 
        Darwin and his supporters.</p>

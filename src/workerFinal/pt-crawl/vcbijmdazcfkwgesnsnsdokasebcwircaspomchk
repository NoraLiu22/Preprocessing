            to earn a certificate that would permit her to teach science to young 
            women. Meanwhile, she continued to conduct her research on the magnetic 
            properties of steel. The director of the Municipal School of Industrial 
            Physics and Chemistry granted her permission to complete that work 
            on the school premises, although even Pierre had no private laboratory 
            there. The school did not help to subsidize her studies, but she received 
            complimentary steel samples from several metallurgical firms. For 
            the rest of her life she would continue this three-cornered arrangement 
            of mutual assistance among research, industry, and the government's 
            educational system. </font></td>

    <td><p align="center"><em>Second Year of the War</em> [430 BCE]
<p>In the first days of summer the Lacedaemonians and their allies, with
two-thirds of their forces as before, invaded Attica, under the command
of Archidamus, son of Zeuxidamus, King of Lacedaemon, and sat down and
laid waste the country.
<p>Not many days after their arrival in Attica the plague first began to
show itself among the Athenians.&nbsp; It was said that it had broken out
in many places previously in the neighborhood of Lemnos (<b><font color="#ED181E">3</font></b>)
and elsewhere; but a pestilence of such extent and mortality was nowhere
remembered.&nbsp; Neither were the physicians at first of any service,
ignorant as they were of the proper way to treat it, but they died themselves
the most thickly, as they visited the sick most often; nor did any human
art succeed any better.&nbsp; Supplications in the temples, divinations,
and so forth were found equally futile, till the overwhelming nature of
the disaster at last put a stop to them altogether.

<p>It first began, it is said, in the parts of Ethiopia (<b><font color="#ED181E">1</font></b>)
above Egypt, and thence descended into Egypt and Libya (<b><font color="#ED181E">2</font></b>) and
into most of the King's country.&nbsp; Suddenly falling upon Athens, it
first attacked the population in Piraeus (<b><font color="#ED181E">4</font></b>) -- which
was the occasion of their saying that the Peloponnesians had poisoned the
reservoirs, there being as yet no wells up there -- and afterwards appeared
in the upper city, when the deaths became much more frequent.
<p><center>

</center>

<p>All speculation as to its origin and its causes, if causes can be found
adequate to produce so great a disturbance, I leave to other writers, whether
lay or professional; for myself, I shall simply set down its nature, and
explain the symptoms by which perhaps it may be recognized by the student,
if it should ever break out again.&nbsp; This I can the better do, as I
had the disease myself, and watched its operation in the case of others.
<p>That year then is admitted to have been otherwise unprecedentedly free
from sickness; and such few cases as occurred all determined in this.
<p>As a rule, however, there was no ostensible cause; but people in good
health were all of a sudden attacked by:
<ul>
<li>
violent heats in the head, and</li>

<li>
redness and inflammation in the eyes,</li>

<li>
the inward parts, such as the throat or tongue, becoming bloody and emitting
an unnatural and fetid breath.</li>
</ul>
These symptoms were followed by:
<ul>
<li>
sneezing and hoarseness, after which</li>

<li>
the pain soon reached the chest, and produced a hard cough.</li>

<li>
When it fixed in the stomach, it upset it; and</li>

<li>
discharges of bile of every kind named by physicians ensued, accompanied
by very great distress.</li>

<li>
In most cases also an ineffectual retching followed, producing violent
spasms, which in some cases ceased soon after, in others much later.</li>

<li>
Externally the body was not very hot to the touch, nor pale in its appearance,
but reddish, livid, and breaking out into small pustules and ulcers.</li>

<li>
But internally it burned so that the patient could not bear to have on
him clothing or linen even of the very lightest description; or indeed
to be otherwise than stark naked.</li>
</ul>
What they would have liked best would have been to throw themselves into
cold water; as indeed was done by some of the neglected sick, who plunged
into the rain-tanks in their agonies of unquenchable thirst; though it
made no difference whether they drank little or much.
<p>Besides this, the miserable feeling of not being able to rest or sleep
never ceased to torment them.&nbsp; The body meanwhile did not waste away
so long as the distemper was at its height, but held out to a marvel against
its ravages; so that when they succumbed, as in most cases, on the seventh
or eighth day to the internal inflammation, they had still some strength
in them.
<p>But if they passed this stage, and the disease descended further into
the bowels, inducing a violent ulceration there accompanied by severe diarrhea,
this brought on a weakness which was generally fatal.
<p>For the disorder first settled in the head, ran its course from thence
through the whole of the body, and, even where it did not prove mortal,
it still left its mark on the extremities; for it settled in the privy
parts, the fingers and the toes, and many escaped with the loss of these,
some too with that of their eyes.&nbsp; Others again were seized with an
entire loss of memory on their first recovery, and did not know either
themselves or their friends.
<p>But while the nature of the distemper was such as to baffle all description,
and its attacks almost too grievous for human nature to endure, it was
still in the following circumstance that its difference from all ordinary
disorders was most clearly shown.&nbsp; All the birds and beasts that prey
upon human bodies, either abstained from touching them (though there were
many lying unburied), or died after tasting them.&nbsp; In proof of this,
it was noticed that birds of this kind actually disappeared; they were
not about the bodies, or indeed to be seen at all.&nbsp; But of course
the effects which I have mentioned could best be studied in a domestic
animal like the dog.
<p>Such then, if we pass over the varieties of particular cases which were
many and peculiar, were the general features of the distemper.&nbsp; Meanwhile
the town enjoyed an immunity from all the ordinary disorders; or if any
case occurred, it ended in this.
<p>Some died in neglect, others in the midst of every attention.&nbsp;
No remedy was found that could be used as a specific; for what did good
in one case, did harm in another.&nbsp; Strong and weak constitutions proved
equally incapable of resistance, all alike being swept away, although dieted
with the utmost precaution.&nbsp; By far the most terrible feature in the
malady was the dejection which ensued when any one felt himself sickening,
for the despair into which they instantly fell took away their power of
resistance, and left them a much easier prey to the disorder; besides which,
there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught
the infection in nursing each other.&nbsp; This caused the greatest mortality.
<p>On the one hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished
from neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want
of a nurse:&nbsp; on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the
consequence.&nbsp; This was especially the case with such as made any pretensions
to goodness:&nbsp; honor made them unsparing of themselves in their attendance
in their friends' houses, where even the members of the family were at
last worn out by the moans of the dying, and succumbed to the force of
the disaster.
<p>Yet it was with those who had recovered from the disease that the sick
and the dying found most compassion.&nbsp; These knew what it was from
experience, and had now no fear for themselves; for the same man was never
attacked twice -- never at least fatally.&nbsp; And such persons not only
received the congratulations of others, but themselves also, in the elation
of the moment, half entertained the vain hope that they were for the future
safe from any disease whatsoever.
<p>An aggravation of the existing calamity was the influx from the country
into the city, and this was especially felt by the new arrivals.&nbsp;
As there were no houses to receive them, they had to be lodged at the hot
season of the year in stifling cabins, where the mortality raged without
restraint.
<p>The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and half-dead creatures
reeled about the streets and gathered round all the fountains in their
longing for water.&nbsp; The sacred places also in which they had quartered
themselves were full of corpses of persons that had died there, just as
they were; for as the disaster passed all bounds, men, not knowing what
was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred
or profane.
<p>All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset, and they buried
the bodies as best they could.&nbsp; Many from want of the proper appliances,
through so many of their friends having died already, had recourse to the
most shameless sepulchers:&nbsp; sometimes getting the start of those who
had raised a pile, they threw their own dead body upon the stranger's pyre
and ignited it; sometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying
on the top of another that was burning, and so went off.
<p>Nor was this the only form of lawless extravagance which owed its origin
to the plague.&nbsp; Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly
done in a corner, and not just as they pleased, seeing the rapid transitions
produced by persons in prosperity suddenly dying and those who before had
nothing succeeding to their property.&nbsp; So they resolved to spend quickly
and enjoy themselves, regarding their lives and riches as alike things
of a day.
<p>Perseverance in what men called honor was popular with none, it was
so uncertain whether they would be spared to attain the object; but it
was settled that present enjoyment, and all that contributed to it, was
both honorable and useful.&nbsp; Fear of gods or law of man there was none
to restrain them.&nbsp; As for the first, they judged it to be just the
same whether they worshipped them or not, as they saw all alike perishing;
and for the last, no one expected to live to be brought to trial for his
offenses, but each felt that a far severer sentence had been already passed
upon them all and hung ever over their heads, and before this fell it was
only reasonable to enjoy life a little.
<p>Such was the nature of the calamity, and heavily did it weigh on the
Athenians; death raging within the city and devastation without.&nbsp;
Among other things which they remembered in their distress was, very naturally,
the following verse which the old men said had long ago been uttered:
<blockquote><i>A Dorian war shall come and with it death.</i></blockquote>
So a dispute arose as to whether dearth and not death had not been the
word in the verse; but at the present juncture, it was of course decided
in favor of the latter; for the people made their recollection fit in with
their sufferings.&nbsp; I fancy, however, that if another Dorian war should
ever afterwards come upon us, and a dearth should happen to accompany it,
the verse will probably be read accordingly.
<p>The oracle also which had been given to the Spartans was now remembered
by those who knew of it.&nbsp; When the god was asked whether they should
go to war, he answered that if they put their might into it, victory would
be theirs, and that he would himself be with them.&nbsp; With this oracle
events were supposed to tally.&nbsp; For the plague broke out as soon as
the Peloponnesians invaded Attica, and never entering Peloponnese (not
at least to an extent worth noticing), committed its worst ravages at Athens,
and next to Athens, at the most populous of the other towns.&nbsp; Such
was the history of the plague.

		<h1><span>A Note on Gender Identity</span></h1>&#13;
&#13;
		<p>This report addresses human rights abuses faced by transgender people in Malaysia. “<b>Transgender</b>” is an inclusive term for anyone whose <span>sex assigned to them at birth—i.e., the designation as “female” or “male” on their birth certificate—does not conform to their lived or perceived gender (the gender that they are most comfortable expressing or would express, if given a choice). </span></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><span>We start from the premise that everyone has a <b>gender identity.</b> Most people identify as either female or male, though some may identify as both, or neither. If someone is labeled “female” at birth but identifies as male, he is a <b>transgender man </b>(or <b>transman</b>)<b>.</b> If someone is labeled “male” at birth but identifies as female, she is a <b>transgender woman </b>(or <b>transwoman</b>)<b>. </b>The term <b>“cisgender”</b> (i.e. non-transgender) is used for someone who identifies with the same gender, male or female, as the sex they were assigned at birth. </span></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><span>Transgender people, as per the usage in this report, are not simply “cross-dressing” for pleasure; rather, they experience a deep sense of identification with a gender different from the sex assigned to them at birth. They may or may not take steps to physically alter their bodies, such as undergoing <b>hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</b> or <b>sex reassignment surgery (SRS)</b>.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p>Gender identity is not the same thing as <b>sexual orientation</b>. Like cisgender people, transgender people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or asexual—that is, they may be attracted to people of the opposite gender, the same gender, both genders, or neither.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p>Several terms are used to describe transgender and gender non-conforming people. In Malaysia, transgender women are known as <b><i>mak nyah</i></b>, a non-stigmatizing term developed by transgender women themselves.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p>The term <b>“transvestite”</b> is often used in the Malaysian press, and is also used by government institutions such as the Department of Islamic Development, or JAKIM. However, “transvestite” more accurately refers to a person who cross-dresses from time to time for pleasure. Transvestites, or “cross-dressers,” do not necessarily identify with a gender different from the gender associated with the sex assigned to them at birth. It is therefore inaccurate to describe Malaysia’s <i>mak nyahs</i> as “transvestites.” However, some transvestites may identify as transgender.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p>The term <b>“transsexual”</b> has also been applied to this population, both by the media and by transgender Malaysians themselves. “Transsexual,” however, often has a more narrow meaning: those who use hormones or undergo surgery in order to effect a physical transformation from one sex to another.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<h1><span>Glossary</span></h1>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Assigned sex:</b> The classification of bodies at birth as male or female, based on such factors as external sex organs, internal sexual and reproductive organs, hormones, and chromosomes.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Bisexual: </b>The sexual orientation of a person who is sexually and romantically attracted to both women and men.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Cisgender</b> <b> <span>:</span> </b> <span> An adjective used to describe the gender identity of people whose birth sex (the sex they were declared to have upon birth) conforms to their lived and/or perceived gender (the gender that they are most comfortable with expressing or would express, if given a choice).</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Cross-dressing:</b> The act of wearing clothing and other accoutrements commonly associated with the opposite sex within a particular society.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><i>Fatwa</i>: </b>An edict issued by a Muslim religious authority. According to Malaysian law, fatwas approved by the sultan in each state are published in the gazette and take on the force of Sharia law.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Gay:</b> A synonym for homosexual in many parts of the world.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Gender:</b> The social and cultural codes (as opposed to biological sex) used to distinguish between society’s conceptions of “femininity” and “masculinity.”</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Gender Dysphoria (also Gender Identity Disorder, GID)</b><b>:</b> The formal diagnosis used by psychologists and physicians to describe persons who experience significant discontent with the sex they were assigned at birth. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10 CM) classifies GID as a medical disorder. In the United States, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) replaced “Gender Identity Disorder” with “Gender Dysphoria” in 2013 to avoid the stigma associated with “disorder.”</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Gender Expression:</b> The external characteristics and behaviors that societies define as “feminine,” “androgynous,” or “masculine,” including such attributes as dress appearance, mannerisms, hair style, speech patterns, and social behavior and interactions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Gender Identity: </b>A person’s internal, deeply felt sense of being female or male, both, or something other than female and male.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Heterosexual:</b> The sexual orientation of a person whose primary sexual and romantic attraction is toward people of the other sex.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Homosexual: </b>The sexual orientation of a person whose primary sexual and romantic attraction is toward people of the same sex.</p>&#13;

&#13;
		<p><b>Lesbian:</b> The sexual orientation of a woman whose primary sexual and romantic attraction is toward other women.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>LGBT:</b> Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; an inclusive term for groups and identities sometimes also grouped as "sexual and gender minorities."</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><i>Mak Nyah</i>: </b>A Malay term which derives from “mak” (mother), coined by transgender Malaysians to refer to transgender women.</p>&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
		<p><b><i>Pengkid</i>:</b> A term, mostly used by ethnic Malays, to refer variously to Malay girls and women who dress in a masculine way, use gender neutral or ambiguous names, bind their chests, are in romantic relationships with women, or are butch lesbians, or transmen.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><i>Pondan</i>: </b>A derogatory Malay term for an effeminate male, a gay male, or a transgender woman.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Sex Marker:</b> The label of “female” or “male” on one’s birth certificate or identity card. The term <b>“gender marker”</b> is more commonly used, but we use “sex marker,” since the label is largely based on the genitals that one is born with, not on a person’s lived gender.</p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b>Sex Reassignment Surgery</b><b>(SRS): </b>The term<b>refers to surgical interventions to change one’s body so as to resemble a body of the opposite sex. SRS is usually preceded by a minimum period of hormone therapy<b>to induce secondary sex characteristics of the desired sex.</b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><b><span>Sexual Orientation: </span> </b> <span>The term refers to a person’s sexual and emotional attraction to members of the same gender (homosexuals, gay men, and lesbians), the opposite gender (heterosexuals), or both genders (bisexuals).</span> </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
		<p><b><b><b><span>Sharia (or Syariah) Law: </span> </b> <span>Islamic law, having jurisdiction over every Muslim in Malaysia.</span> </b></b></p>&#13;

&#13;
		<p><b><b><b><span>Transgender man (</span> </b> <b> <span>transman): </span> </b> <span>A person designated female at birth, but who identifies and may publicly present, as a man. Transgender men are referred to with male pronouns.</span> </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><b><span>Transgender woman (transwoman)</span> </b> <span>: A person designated male at birth, but who identifies and may publicly present, as a woman. Transgender women are referred to with female pronouns.</span><b> </b></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><b><b><span>Transphobia:</span> </b> <span> Fear of and contempt for transgender and transsexual persons, often based on negative stereotypes about transgenderism and transsexuality. </span> </b></b></b></p>&#13;

&#13;
		<p><b><b>Shortly after midnight on June 9, 2014, officials from the Islamic Religious Department in the Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan raided a wedding party being held in the yard of a private home. They rounded up and arrested 17 invited guests, including the wedding planners and a child. The Religious Department officials beat at least one person during the arrests, choking her and kicking her to the ground. They tore another guest’s clothing. Later that day, a state Sharia (Islamic law) court convicted all 16 of the adults who had been arrested and sentenced them to seven days in prison and a fine. </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>What criminal offense had the wedding guests committed? </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Their “crime” was dressing in women’s clothing. These guests were transgender women, arrested under a state Sharia law that criminalizes “a man posing as a woman.” They were taken to prison and placed in a segregated cell in the male prison block, where they had their heads shaved. The judge at the Sharia court humiliated them, telling them they looked more “handsome” with shaved heads. After serving their sentences, they were released, having become the latest casualty of state-sponsored discrimination on the basis of gender identity.</b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Although transgender people historically enjoyed a high degree of acceptance in Malaysia, a series of legislative initiatives, beginning in the 1980s, have criminalized them and forced them further underground. Under these discriminatory laws, transgender people—individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex assigned to them at birth—can be arrested simply for wearing clothing deemed not to pertain to their assigned sex. A constitutional challenge to the state laws in Negeri Sembilan is currently underway, with a ruling expected on November 7, 2014. The ruling, while only binding in Negeri Sembilan, has the potential to fundamentally alter the legal status of transgender people throughout Malaysia. </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Arrests of transgender people usually take place under state Sharia laws, which are enforced by state Islamic Religious Departments and are only applicable to Muslims, who make up approximately 60 percent of Malaysia’s population. While the language of such laws varies across Malaysia’s 13 states and 3 federal territories, most Sharia enactments contain provisions that prohibit “a man posing as a woman,” and three states similarly criminalize “a woman posing as a man.” As far as Human Rights Watch has been able to ascertain, despite the existence of some laws targeting transgender men (“women posing as men,” in the eyes of the Malaysian authorities), all arrests to date under these laws have targeted transgender women. Officers of the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) (all police in Malaysia belong to the federal RMP) have also at times arrested transgender women under an overly vague provision of the secular federal criminal code that prohibits “public indecency” and applies to people of all religious backgrounds.  </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Both religious and civil police have perpetrated abuses against transwomen during arrests. In some cases, Religious Department officials physically and sexually assault them during arrest or while in custody, or parade them before the media, humiliating them. Human Rights Watch is unaware of any Religious Department officials having been held accountable for these violations. Transwomen also report that civil police sometimes extort money or sex from them. In cases in which transwomen are sentenced to prison, they are usually placed in male wards, where they face sexual assault at the hands of both wardens and male prisoners.</b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Transgender people in Malaysia face discrimination and abuse from a range of state officials and agents—including police officers, state Religious Department officials, public sector health workers, prison guards, and public school teachers and administrators. Official discrimination against transgender people is compounded by other forms of discrimination for which the government provides little or no protection: Human Rights Watch found that transgender people are fired from their jobs, evicted from their homes, physically and sexually assaulted, and denied access to health care because of their gender identities. When public officials or private individuals commit violence against transgender people, the victims face serious obstacles—and at times further sexual abuse—from the police who are supposed to be helping them. </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Government officials, politicians, and religious leaders fuel the flames of violence and discrimination against transgender people with transphobic and homophobic rhetoric. Typically, this rhetoric groups together lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, labeling them as criminal or un-Islamic. <span>Although the government of Prime Minister Najib Razak presents Malaysia to the international community as a “moderate Muslim” country, it has taken a series of public positions that </span>draw on a narrow interpretation of Islam to endorse restrictions on religious freedom, LGBT rights, and gender equality that <span>cater to </span>extremist views. </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><span>Transgender people, both Muslim and non-Muslim, have been affected by the Islamization of public policy in multiple ways. Not only are Muslim transgender women criminalized under Sharia enactments, but a <i>fatwa</i>, or Islamic decree, issued in 1982 by the National Fatwa Council, prohibits Muslims from undergoing sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and Muslim medical institutions from providing such surgeries. Although in principle, a non-Muslim medical institution could still offer SRS to non-Muslims, most transgender people have found it impossible to find doctors who will perform SRS. The National Registration Department does not allow transgender people—neither Muslim nor non-Muslim—to change the sex marker (“female” or “male”) on their identity cards to match their gender identity. Even when transgender people have undergone SRS outside Malaysia, they are still denied this right, forcing them to live in a legal limbo in which their body does not match the sex listed on their identity card.  </span> </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><span>At times, Malaysian government institutions have recognized some of the needs of transgender people. </span>Government recognition of transgender women as a “most at-risk population” (MARP) in the fight against HIV has led to some government outreach aimed at engaging transgender people in HIV prevention efforts and ensuring that those who are HIV-positive receive treatment. The Ministry of Health has reported that prosecutions of transgender people obstruct the fight against HIV by driving them underground, although the Ministry has not undertaken efforts to reform those laws. The federal Department of Islamic Development (<i>Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia</i>, JAKIM), a body established with the purpose of “mobilis[ing] the development and progress of Muslims in Malaysia,” and ensuring the widespread teaching of Islam, has taken on a role in HIV prevention and care; among its activities, it has reached out to transwomen, although its messaging may at times reinforce stigma rather than alleviate it.</b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><span>Despite the challenges they face, transgender people in Malaysia are not passive victims of their circumstances. A vibrant transgender movement has developed, with trans people increasingly speaking out and demanding that their rights be respected. The Kuala Lumpur-based organization, Justice for Sisters, seeks to raise public awareness about violence and persecution against transgender women, and supports legal challenges to the state Sharia “cross-dressing” laws. The “I AM YOU: Be A Trans Ally” multimedia campaign aims to promote positive images of transgender people and allows transgender people an avenue to share their stories. Civil society organizations ranging from the Malaysian Bar Council to the Muslim feminist group Sisters in Islam have taken public stances in support of transgender rights.  </span> </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>In 2010, four transgender women filed a constitutional challenge against the “cross-dressing” laws in the state of Negeri Sembilan. The applicants had been arrested repeatedly under the law, in some cases simply for wearing women’s hair accessories. Three of them had been subjected to physical or sexual abuse by the state Religious Department officials who carried out the arrests. Through their lawyer, the women argued that the law prohibiting “a man posing as a woman” violated their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of movement, and equal protection, all of which are guaranteed by Malaysia’s constitution. A judge in the first instance decided against the applicants, and in 2014, their appeal was heard at the Court of Appeal in the federal administrative center, Putrajaya. A ruling is expected on November 7, 2014. </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Several transgender people born in the 1950s and 1960s told Human Rights Watch that they remembered a more progressive, less discriminatory Malaysia. Today’s transgender activists aim to remind Malaysians of their more tolerant past, and to ensure that transgender Malaysians are not stripped of their fundamental rights, protected under Malaysia’s constitution and international human rights law, because of their gender identity or expression.</b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Human Rights Watch calls on the federal and state governments of Malaysia to repeal discriminatory laws and fatwas that deny transgender people their basic rights—and prohibit them from being who they are. State Religious Departments and the federal police should end all forms of abuse against transgender people, including arbitrary arrests and detention; sexual assault, torture and ill-treatment; and extortion of money and sex. The authorities should investigate and appropriately discipline or prosecute those responsible for such abuses. Malaysian government officials, politicians, and religious leaders should cease making inflammatory or denigrating statements about transgender people and should instead take steps to protect them from violence and discrimination.</b></b></p>&#13;

&#13;
		<p><b><b><span>Human Rights Watch conducted field research in Malaysia in January 2014 in four states—Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Penang, and Pahang—and in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. A Human Rights Watch researcher interviewed 66 people, including 42 transgender women (several of whom were also activists and outreach workers) and 3 transgender men; as well as lawyers; HIV prevention and outreach workers; human rights activists; a criminologist, a psychologist, and a medical doctor; a representative of the federal Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM); a representative of the governmental human rights commission (SUHAKAM); an elected state assemblyman; and foreign diplomats. Human Rights Watch contacted the Ministry of Health and the Prison Department by email to inquire about policies affecting transgender people, but neither agency responded.</span> </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><span>Most transgender interview subjects were introduced to Human Rights Watch by the activist group, Justice for Sisters, or by other community organizations that work with transgender people. Interviews were conducted in English or in Malay, Tamil, or Cantonese with the assistance of an interpreter. </span>All persons interviewed provided verbal informed consent to participate and were assured that they could end the interview at any time or decline to answer any questions. Most interviewees have been given pseudonyms, and in some cases other identifying information has been withheld to protect their privacy and safety. No one was compensated for their participation. Some participants were reimbursed for modest transport costs incurred to go to interview locations.</b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Although Human Rights Watch only conducted primary research in four states and in one federal territory, some transgender women we interviewed had previously lived in other locations, including Sabah, Sarawak, Kelantan, Kedah, and Johor, and reported on forms of discrimination they faced in those locations. Secondary research, including review of other reports on transgender people in Malaysia, suggests that the types of human rights abuses documented in this report are also common in other states. For instance, Dr. Teh Yik Koon, a professor of sociology and criminology at the National Defense University, conducted a 2000 survey of 507 transgender women in eight states and territories, including six of those in which Human Rights Watch did not conduct research. Teh’s research documents arbitrary arrests and abuse by the police and religious authorities, as well as other abuses and consequences, such as employment discrimination and family rejection, that are similar to those documented here. </b></b></p>&#13;

		<h1><b><b><span><span>I. Background</span> </span></b></b></h1>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Malaysian criminologist Teh Yik Koon, in her groundbreaking work <i>The Mak Myahs: Malaysian Male to Female Transsexuals </i>(2002), recounts an interview with a 63-year-old <i>mak nyah</i> (transgender woman):</b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b>Mak Yam revealed that during her younger days, things were very different from now. Transsexuals were a happy lot at that time as they were left to be who they wanted to be. … The police and the Islamic religious authorities had never bothered them. In fact, the police were good to them and accepted them as they were.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" id="_ftnref1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[1]</span></span></span></a></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Human Rights Watch research in Malaysia elicited similar recollections. Mak Lil, an elderly transgender woman and former sex worker in Kuantan in the eastern state of Pahang, remembered the early 1980s: “There was no violence at that time, and no harassment from the police or the religious authorities.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[2]</span></span></span></a></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Sarah, a 52-year-old transwoman in Kuala Lumpur, said that she faced little discrimination before the National Fatwa Council issued a fatwa in 1982 against sex reassignment surgery: “I came out [as a transwoman] in the early 80s [before the fatwa]. Then, there was not much discrimination. Everything was going well—I seldom received discrimination. Only after the fatwa came out, so many things happened.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[3]</span></span></span></a></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Not all transgender women share such a rosy picture of the past, but what is clear from the historical record is that transgender people have long had a visible presence in Malaysia and, during some periods, have faced significantly less discrimination than they do today. According to anthropologist Michael Peletz, historical texts from the 15th to 19th centuries testify to the existence at that time of “androgynous” priests or courtiers, both male and female:</b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b>[T]he evidence indicates the existence in the Malay Peninsula in the late pre-modern and modern era of a pre-Islamic class of male-bodied priests or courtiers, referred to by the term <i>sida-sida </i>… who were said to be involved in ‘androgynous behavior,’ such as wearing women’s clothes and possibly performing tasks generally undertaken by women.</b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Peletz also finds references to “female <i>sida-sida</i>,<i>”</i> and to “<i>sida-sida</i> and their wives,” suggesting that these individuals included “male- as well as female-bodied persons involved in transgender practices.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[4]</span></span></span></a><i>Sida-sida</i> and other ritual specialists known as <i>pawing, </i>which included women dressing as men, were reported in Malaysian palaces well into the 20th century.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[5]</span></span></span></a></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Joseph Goh, a PhD candidate in gender and sexuality studies at Malaysia’s Monash University, writes:</b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b>Trans* persons have long been important figures in the landscape of the Malay archipelago. In the 19th century, the <i>manang bali</i> or Iban shamans who dressed as women were respectable curers and local leaders. Right up to the 20th century in the archipelago, many transwomen were royal courtiers. Transwomen village performers were also favourably treated by the Sultan of the state of Kelantan in the 1960s.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[6]</span></span></span></a></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Although the ritual roles of transgender people diminished in the 20th century, Peletz found during fieldwork in the 1970s and 1980s that, “normatively orientated Malays still exhibited considerable tolerance and respect for individuals involved in transgendering, assuming they merited tolerance and respect on other grounds as well.” Some transgender people maintained a particular ritual status as <i>mak andam</i>, or “ritual practitioners whose roles include planning weddings and beautifying brides.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[7]</span></span></a></span></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Beginning around 1980, sex reassignment surgery (SRS) was available to transgender people in Malaysia. A team of surgeons performed these surgeries at the University of Malaya Hospital. However, in 1982, the National Fatwa Council learned about the surgeries and issued a fatwa banning SRS.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[8]</span></span></a></span> The hospital facilities shut down in 1983, even though fatwas issued by the National Fatwa Council have no legal authority. </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><span>In 1987, transgender women in Kuala Lumpur coined the term “<i>mak nyah</i>” to identify themselves, and formed the Federal Territory Mak Nyah Association. In what trans activist Khartini Slamah describes as a “strategic alliance,” the association successfully sought small grants from the Federal Welfare Department to allow transgender women to start small businesses, noting that the department “look[ed] on <i>mak nyahs</i> as a social problem and want[ed] to rehabilitate us as biological men.” The association mobilized transwomen to file complaints against street gangsters and pimps who were violent toward them, and sought to change public perceptions of transwomen as being “only good for sex and entertainment.” After three years, however, JAWI, the Religious Department in the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, banned the association.</span> <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9"> <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> <span>[9]</span> </span> </span> </a> </b></b></p>&#13;

&#13;
		<p><b><b>Under Prime Minister Mahathir, UMNO developed a 1982 policy guideline “for the incorporation of Islamic ethics in governance.” Manifestations of UMNO’s increasingly hardline stance included the introduction of whipping as a punishment for women who engage in “illicit sex” and the attempt to prevent Christians from using the word “Allah.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[11]</span></span></span></a>It is in this context that transwomen reported increasing harassment, particularly from state Religious Department officials. </b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b>Between 1985 and 2012, every Malaysian state and federal territory introduced Sharia criminal enactments that included provisions criminalizing “a man posing as a woman” or “a woman posing as a man” (see Appendix I).

		<p><b><b><i>In 1998, the Malaysian authorities discovered the power of tainting their political rivals with homosexuality allegations.

		<p><b><b><i>Anwar was convicted of corruption in 1999 and of sodomy in 2000. He spent six years in prison before the Federal Court, Malaysia’s highest court, overturned his sodomy conviction in September 2004. After a brief period of self-imposed exile, Anwar returned to Malaysia and became the de facto leader of the political opposition, soon becoming a thorn in the side of the UMNO government. He was charged with sodomy yet again in 2008, won acquittal in the court of first instance in January 2012, but was subsequently convicted on appeal in March 2014.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" id="_ftnref16"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[16]</span></span></span></a> He has filed an appeal to the Federal Court.</i></b></b></p>&#13;

		<p><b><b><i>Politics and anti-LGBT sentiment again intertwined when police banned the Seksualiti Merdeka (Sexuality Independence) festival in 2011. LGBT rights activists initiated the festival in 2008, featuring workshops, talks, and performances on sexual diversity and LGBT rights within the broader human rights context. It was held without incident for three years, attracting hundreds of participants, before police banned it, claiming the festival constituted a “threat to public order.”<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" id="_ftnref17"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[17]</span></span></span></a> According to one of the organizers, the festival was “collateral damage” in an UMNO smear campaign against Ambiga Sreenevasan, an outspoken political activist and head of a coalition for free and fair elections, who had been scheduled to officiate the 2011 festival in her personal capacity.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" id="_ftnref18"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[18]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;

In 2013, trans activists developed the “Be a Trans Ally” campaign, featuring video testimonies that highlight both the strength and the struggles of trans Malaysians, and distributing educational materials covering subjects ranging from what pronouns to use to refer to trans people, to the importance of creating safe spaces within the health care and education sectors.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" id="_ftnref47"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[47]</span></span></span></a> The organization, Justice for Sisters, conducts regular outreach to communities to sensitize them on trans issues and maintains an active presence on social media.

		<h1><b><b><i><span><span>II. Criminalization and Mistreatment of Transgender People under Sharia Law</span> </span></i></b></b></h1>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>On June 9, 2014, 16 transgender women and one child were arrested while attending a wedding in Jempol district, Negeri Sembilan. Islamic Religious Department officials raided the wedding party, held at a private home, and arrested the transwomen, several of whom were wedding planners, known locally as <i>mak andam</i>, while others were invited guests. The officials beat one of the women—choking her and kicking her—and tore another woman’s clothing in the course of the arrest. The 16 adults were sentenced to seven-day prison sentences and fines. Because they are legally considered “men,” they served their sentences in the male ward of Sungai Udong prison. There, prison authorities forcibly shaved their heads in what the women said was an effort to negate their gender identity.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" id="_ftnref52"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[52]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>The wedding guests were arrested under article 66 of the Syariah Criminal Enactment, 1992, which reads: “Any male person who, in any public place wears a woman’s attire or poses as a woman shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.”<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" id="_ftnref53"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[53]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Their arrest occurred shortly after a hearing at the Court of Appeal in Putrajaya in which the applicants challenged the constitutionality of Negeri Sembilan’s “cross-dressing” law. In 2011, four transgender women had filed a case in the Negeri Sembilan High Court calling for judicial review of the law, on the grounds that it violates fundamental rights protected by the constitution, including the right to freedom of expression. When their case was rejected by the High Court in 2012, they filed an appeal. The Court of Appeal, Malaysia’s second highest court below the Federal Court, is expected to issue a ruling on November 7, 2014.  </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Transwomen in Negeri Sembilan are far from alone in being victimized under this sort of law. Arrests of transgender women under Sharia law take place throughout Malaysia. Laws vary from state to state; some penalize a “male person posing as a woman for immoral purposes,” and are primarily used against transgender sex workers (though “immoral purposes” is undefined), whereas others penalize a "male person posing as a woman” under <i>any</i> circumstances. In four states, Sharia laws also penalize a woman posing as a man. Maximum sentences range from six months to three years in prison, and fines from RM 1,000 (US$314) to RM 5,000 ($1,559). In some states, the Islamic Religious Departments, tasked with enforcing Sharia law, carry out systematic raids against transgender women, often with the participation of the civil police.</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Human Rights Watch conducted research in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang. Of these states, only in Pahang, the state that most recently criminalized cross-dressing, in 2012, did the transgender women we interviewed report that they were unaware of any arrests of transwomen under Sharia laws. Transwomen we interviewed also recounted being arrested by Religious Department officials in Kedah, Johor, Malacca, and Sarawak.<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" id="_ftnref54"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[54]</span></span></span></a> Those that were taken before the Sharia courts were almost inevitably found guilty; they had no legal representation and were given little opportunity to defend themselves.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" id="_ftnref55"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[55]</span></span></span></a> In most cases, they were not imprisoned but were required to pay fines—sometimes amounting to a month’s salary or more.</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Aston Paiva, the lawyer representing transgender women in the Negeri Sembilan case, told Human Rights Watch that rights violations against transwomen are particularly pronounced in states that prohibit cross-dressing under all circumstances. In those states, he said:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>The moment a transgender person or a transsexual person walks out of a house, or is sitting in a restaurant, having something to eat, she can be arrested. So there’s this chilling effect on the ability to move around public places. The law applies in all public places, and as you can see, [transgender people] would be directly and continuously affected by such a law.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" id="_ftnref56"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[56]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Beka, a 31-year-old transgender woman from Kedah state, is one of many transgender women who have been subjected to multiple arrests: she told Human Rights Watch that she has been arrested five times for dressing as a woman. On one occasion, she was fined RM 3,000 (US$935), simply for sitting in a parked car with her friends, wearing a traditional Malay <i>kebaya</i> (blouse and long skirt).<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" id="_ftnref57"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[57]</span></span></span></a> She lost her job as a result of the arrest, as detailed in the section on employment discrimination, below. On another occasion, in 2012, she was arrested while distributing condoms to other transgender women in her role as an outreach worker for a registered public health organization. </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Beka recalled: </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>I was doing outreach to deliver condoms to transgender people, as a volunteer with [a public health organization] in Kedah. I had walked halfway to where the TGs [transgenders] were that I needed to do outreach to, at a road by the railway track, when I saw the religious authorities. I saw the white van with the high beam, and knew it was the religious authorities.</i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Beka tried to run, but was caught, while the transgender women she was trying to reach all managed to escape. The religious official who arrested her rifled through her bag and found condoms, which he confiscated, threatening to charge her with prostitution. But when she was taken to the Religious Department, she was given a letter that accused her of “dressing and acting like a woman.” Beka said, “I did not really feel afraid [of getting charged] that time because I was just wearing jeans and a T-shirt—but they still accused me, even though I was not dressed as a woman that day.”<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" id="_ftnref58"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[58]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>The most recent time Beka was arrested, she was attending a private, invitation-only beauty pageant held at an upscale hotel. Although the law in Kedah only applies to cross-dressing in public, religious officials raided the private function, overstepping their legal mandate.</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Aisah, a 33-year-old transwoman, has been arrested five times in Johor since 2002. The first time she was arrested, religious officers picked her up in the street and handcuffed her, without explaining who they were until after they had shoved her into a van. Aisah recalled that as one officer at the Religious Department took her statement, “Another officer in the room was hurling insults at me—“You were born a man, you’re not scared of God. What kind of human being are you?’”<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" id="_ftnref59"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[59]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Like Beka, Aisah has also been arrested at a private function: a transgender beauty pageant at a five-star hotel in Johor. She said, “I don’t know why the religious officers came inside the hotel, because it was a private party.”<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" id="_ftnref60"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[60]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Non-Muslim transgender women are also caught up in Religious Department roundups. Aisah said that in 2009, religious officials raided a disco in Johor and arrested 76 transwomen, loaded them all into vans and took them all to the Religious Department lockup. Only once they arrived did they sort through the women’s IDs, allowing Indian and Chinese women to go. Aisah remembered, “A Chinese TG was crying the whole time: ‘This isn’t fair, I’m not Muslim. What’s their right to arrest me?’”<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" id="_ftnref61"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[61]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Civil police, although they are only mandated to enforce secular criminal law, often play a role in the arrests of Muslim transgender women. Leela, a 38-year-old transgender HIV outreach worker in Kuala Lumpur, believes their aim is to extort money from transwomen, who fear being transferred to the religious authorities. Police arrested Leela arbitrarily in 2013, while she was on her way home from work:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>Last year I was arrested in Chow Kit. I had just finished work, and was going to buy <i>nasi lemak </i>[a rice dish]. I was not doing sex work, but was in a sex work place. There are lots of police there who always catch transgenders who do sex work—they want money. Three of them surrounded me. I said, ‘What did I do?’ They wanted to charge me under Sharia law for cross-dressing, even though they were civil police. </i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>They took me to Chow Kit police station and put me in lockup. A police officer tried to scare me by saying they would take me to the Sharia law court. I said, ‘Send me—I didn’t do anything wrong.’ I think he was trying to scare me in order to get money, but I knew my rights.<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" id="_ftnref62"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[62]</span></span></span></a> Most transgenders, if you don’t give money, they send you to the Sharia law court. After half an hour he released me.<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" id="_ftnref63"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[63]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>According to longtime trans activist Khartini Slamah, police treatment of transgender people has improved following efforts by the transgender community to engage in dialogue with the authorities beginning in the 1990s. However, Slamah noted: “We have not experienced such improvements with the religious anti-vice squad.”<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" id="_ftnref64"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[64]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<h2><b><b><i><span><span>Arbitrary Arrests</span> </span></i></b></b></h2>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>State Sharia enactments provide no guidelines as to what constitutes “posing as a woman.” This ambiguity leads to arbitrary enforcement against those who may look effeminate, regardless of whether or not they are dressed in distinctively “female” clothing (a category which in itself has no clear definition).</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Aisah, whose arrest during a disco raid in Johor is recounted above, was arrested solely because she has breasts, a result of the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) she has undergone since age 14: </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>One thing I don’t understand—I was wearing a T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops, and they charged me as [impersonating] a woman. … I asked them why I was accused of wearing women’s clothing. They said, ‘Because you have breasts.’<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" id="_ftnref65"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[65]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>After another religious official questioned why she should be detained if she was only wearing a T-shirt and shorts, Aisah was released on the condition that she attend a three-hour counseling session by religious teachers <i>(ustaz</i>). There, she recalled, “They said things like, ‘You need to be a man, you were born a man.’”<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" id="_ftnref66"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[66]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Nurul, who has also undergone HRT, was arrested in 2000 in Kuala Lumpur. She was wearing a gender-neutral T-shirt and jeans, but when religious authorities spotted that she had a bra on underneath, they arrested her. According to Nurul:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>I said, ‘Why are you arresting me when I’m wearing jeans and a T-shirt?’ They said, ‘Because you’re wearing a bra.’ I said, ‘I have breasts! This is between me and God, this has nothing to do with you.’ They let me go because I was brave enough to stand up for myself.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" id="_ftnref67"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[67]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Shila, a 40-year-old transwoman in Negeri Sembilan, said the religious authorities have arrested her 20 to 30 times over the past 20 years, regardless of how she is dressed:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>Even before I started dressing like a woman, I was already being arrested by the religious authorities. When I was younger, I was already targeted just for wearing baby T’s. I don’t understand their thinking and their laws. … They would say, ‘Why are you wearing a tight T-shirt? This is a female T-shirt.’ I didn’t understand, because that was the fashion back then—men wore very tight T-shirts and flare pants.<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" id="_ftnref68"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[68]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;

						<h3><b><b><i><span><span>Manis’s Story</span> </span></i></b></b></h3>&#13;
&#13;
						<p><b><b><i><span>I was at a beauty pageant in Kedah state in September 2012. I was invited as a trainer on HIV among the participants. There were 40 to 50 altogether. It wasn’t just a pageant—we had sessions on how to use a condom, how to ask a partner or client to use a condom—I was there to educate my community. My session was held the night before. The whole thing was very educational. I find that organizing such a thing is a good thing. </span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
						<p><b><b><i><span>The next day we heard a rumor that there might be a raid—that someone had reported the event to the religious authorities. We said the event should go on because everyone had turned up. Everyone was dressed in ball gowns, tuxedos. We [decided to] proceed with the dinner, but would not have loud music or dancing…. It was at a private location at a golf course resort. Not just anyone can enter. </span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
						<p><b><b><i><span>[Then] we saw someone signaling to us to disperse. My God, I got goose bumps. About 20 religious authorities came in. They came in their white vans with the name of the Religious Department. I was in shock—I did not expect the event to be raided by them. People started running helter-skelter through the golf course to escape and jump over the fence. The religious authorities [used] the golf carts to chase after them. It was like we were criminals! I was asking myself, “What have we done? Did we kill someone?” About eight people were caught and accused of being cross-dressers. </span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
						<p><b><b><i><span>We’ve had dialogue before with JAKIM [the Department of Islamic Development]. I asked them, “Would you mind if I put on lipstick only?” The authority asked, “Are you crazy?” I said, “We are not crazy people, just like you. Just because I was born with a male genitalia does not make me male.” I told them, “Science will help you understand this.” But they reject that we have the knowledge, and refused to sincerely engage with us on this. I suggested a four-hour session to share my experience. They said they don’t have the time. They don’t really want to understand the issues. They come up with laws without understanding the issues. How can you accuse me of cross-dressing when you don’t even know what cross-dressing is? It’s not what you have between your legs. It’s how you carry yourself. … I’m not “cross-dressing.” I’m 24/7 in this attire and this identity.</span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;

		<p><b><b><i>In 2011, Religious Department officials arrested Victoria, a transgender woman in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, at a roadside food stall at about 11 p.m. They took her to the Negeri Sembilan Religious Department, where they stripped and sexually assaulted her:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>They were rough. One of them squeezed my breasts. I was completely humiliated. … They stripped me completely naked. One of them took a police baton and poked at my genitals.

&#13;
		<p><b><b><i><span>Adik, another transwoman in Seremban, was detained and sexually assaulted by Religious Department officials in early 2012, apparently because they were curious about her body:</span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i><span>I was picked up but I was not taken to the Religious Department. They touched me, molested me, and then allowed me to go. It wasn’t an official raid.

		<p><b><b><i>The laws against cross-dressing, in themselves, invite sexual abuse, as they may require religious officials to verify the sex of the individuals they arrest. A recent report authored by the Malaysian organization Knowledge and Rights with Young people through Safer Spaces (KRYSS), and published by the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), recounts the story of Ima, a transwoman, who stated: “After being arrested, we were all brought to the Religious Department of Perak.

&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Religious Department officials have at times extorted money from transgender people, whom they know are vulnerable and cannot easily seek recourse. Aisah told Human Rights Watch that when religious officials arrested her in Johor in 2010, “One of them recognized me from previous cases and asked me to give him my money and my hand [mobile] phones. Then he released me, and warned me, “I don’t want to ever see your face here again.’”<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" id="_ftnref79"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[79]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Extortion can also be sexual. An official with Family Health Development Association (FHDA), a sexual and reproductive health organization in Penang that works with the transgender community, told Human Rights Watch, “For transgender people, the religious law on cross-dressing is a big risk. Some give a bribe or sexual services when they are arrested—so the risk of HIV increases.”<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" id="_ftnref80"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[80]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;

Izzati, who as a Christian was not subject to Sharia law, was in front of her apartment building with three transgender Muslim friends. When a group of 10 Religious Department officials arrived in the neighborhood in several vehicles, Izzati’s three friends rushed up to the apartment and locked the door. Izzati remained downstairs, where the officials confronted her. She told Human Rights Watch:  </span></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i><span>They checked my IC [identity card] and saw I wasn’t Muslim. Then they went up to my room because they [had seen] my friends going up to my room. They forcibly took the keys out of my handbag. They pulled the bag from me, looked into it, pulled the keys out, and opened the grill [on the front door].

&#13;
		<h2><b><b><i><span><span>Public Humiliation</span> </span></i></b></b></h2>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Religious authorities who have arrested transgender women have on several occasions called television news crews, with the apparent aim of publicly humiliating the victim. One television journalist told Human Rights Watch that both the religious officials and the police “always call us when they are going to do raids and arrest <i>mak nyah</i>.”<a href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" id="_ftnref83"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[83]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;

		<p><b><b><i>Shila, Sunny and Adik, three transwomen in Seremban, were victims of one such raid in July 2013. Shila recounted:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>They brought in TV 3, a public TV station, which has a show called ‘999’ where they show raids. … They forced people to do interviews with the media. We didn’t have a choice. We got in an argument with the <i>ustad </i>[religious official] but they forced us to do an interview. They asked, ‘What’s the price? Who are your clients?’ What’s the benefit of us answering them?

		<h2><b><b><i><span><span>Consequences of Arrests</span> </span></i></b></b></h2>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Being arrested under state cross-dressing laws has consequences for transgender women that go beyond the penalties prescribed by the courts. Beka told Human Rights Watch that she was fired from her job as a waitress in a restaurant after she was arrested the first time: </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>Because of that I lost my job. [My arrest] was published in the newspaper, with a blur on my face, but my statement was there. … My colleagues at work spread around the story. My manager got the newspaper, and he said, ‘I don’t agree with that.’ My manager knew I was a <i>mak nyah</i>, but he was upset that I was in the paper, so he fired me.<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" id="_ftnref85"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[85]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>The arrests of transgender women also have broader social consequences. Criminalization of transgender women poses a threat to HIV prevention work among transgender communities. Beka’s experience of arrest at the hands of Religious Department officials while distributing condoms to transgender sex workers, as part of the outreach work of a recognized NGO, may serve as a deterrent to other would-be HIV outreach workers.<a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" id="_ftnref86"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[86]</span></span></span></a> Raids on beauty pageants held in private locations, which serve as an opportunity to bring together the trans community and provide education on HIV prevention, as Manis experienced in Kedah, have a similar, deterrent effect.<a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" id="_ftnref87"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[87]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;

&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>The constitutionality of Sharia laws that criminalize cross-dressing is currently being challenged in a case before the Court of Appeal in Putrajaya. The applicants, four transgender women from Seremban, first challenged the constitutionality of the state laws with the Negeri Sembilan High Court in February 2011. The High Court judge rejected their application in October 2012 on the grounds that the applicants, as Muslims, were bound by state Sharia law and that constitutional provisions protecting fundamental liberties were therefore irrelevant. According to lawyer Aston Paiva, who was representing the transwomen, the decision was “not based on <i>anything</i> in Malaysia law.”<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" id="_ftnref88"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[88]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Serafina, one of the applicants, said that her personal experience led her to join the case: </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>In 2009 … the nightmare started of getting caught by the religious officials. The first time, I was coming from home, wearing pajamas, going to see my friends to give them some cosmetics. They [the religious authorities] were doing a raid. ... I tried to run. They came with a van. They caught me and pulled my hair. I was shocked. They wouldn’t show their identity cards. I said I didn’t do anything. I didn’t have heels or women’s clothes on. The evidence was just my pajamas, which had kitten prints.</i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>I was arrested three times in one year. The last time, I was wearing unisex tennis shorts and a loose T-shirt in yellow and purple. They arrested me because of my slippers and hair bands. </i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>It’s so wrong. I didn’t do anything to them, I’m just trying to be what I want to be in life. If we win the case, maybe we can change the rules.<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" id="_ftnref89"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[89]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Should the Court of Appeal ruling, expected on November 7, 2014, favor the applicants, it will only be binding in Negeri Sembilan. However, given the similarity of the cross-dressing laws across Malaysia’s states and federal territories, transwomen and their allies in other states could file similar challenges, and those state high courts would be required to treat the Court of Appeal ruling as precedent.<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" id="_ftnref90"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[90]</span></span></span></a> Thus, the Negeri Sembilan case has the potential to contribute significantly to the fulfillment of constitutional rights for transgender people throughout Malaysia. </i></b></b></p>&#13;

		<p><b><b><i>Jenn, a transgender sex worker, was arrested in 2009 with a group of cisgender (non-transgender) female sex workers during a raid of a hotel in Brickfields, a bustling neighborhood in central Kuala Lumpur. When police noted that the sex on her identity card was male, they brought her out to the street and presented her to the gathering crowd. “They were informing the public that I was not female,” said Jenn. “It made me feel shy, sad, humiliated.

In Kuantan, as in several other Malaysian cities, police stop passersby’s and require them to take on-the-spot urine tests. They used this opportunity to abuse and humiliate Chunhua:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>I was arrested by the police once [and forced] to do a urine test. They were stopping people randomly. The police were a bit rough.

		<blockquote><b><b><i>It was humiliating. The others were laughing at me. The police were saying, ‘You want to be a <i>pondan</i>, but you have a penis.’ They touched my breasts and my butt.

		<p><b><b><i>Transgender women who are detained in a male lockup (at either the religious office or the police station), or sentenced to prison in male cells, typically face grave dangers to their security. They are regularly stripped down to their boxer shorts in lockup, exposing their breasts to male inmates—a practice that “invites gang rape,” according to an official at a community organization that works with transgender women.<a href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102" id="_ftnref102"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[102]</span></span></span></a> Occasionally, transwomen are placed in separate police or prison cells, sometimes due to individual negotiations with police officers or wardens.<a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" id="_ftnref103"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[103]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;

There, she was forced to have sex without condoms with the warden, “about two times a week,” and with male prisoners. She said, “I complained to the high officers, the sergeant, but they did not take action.”<a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" id="_ftnref105"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[105]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;

		<p><b><b><i>In other cases, fellow prisoners sexually assault transwomen, who receive no protection from the authorities. In 2009, police carried out a raid on sex workers in the Brickfields neighborhood of Kuala Lumpur and arrested Jenn, a transgender sex worker, along with a group of cisgender female sex workers:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>They took us to lockup at Brickfields Police Station. The girls went to the female lockup, and I went to the male lockup. I was abused by the men in the lockup.

		<p><b><b><i>Nisha Ayub, a transgender activist, was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment in 2000 after being arrested under Malacca’s cross-dressing law. When she arrived at the prison, the wardens subjected her to an anal exam. Then, she said, </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>I was asked to strip naked in front of everyone. They made fun of my breasts, my implants. The wardens actually purposely asked me to show my breasts in front of all the other inmates, [taking me] from one cell to the other cell. It was something that I can’t forget until today. I was actually pleading to the warden, ‘Please don’t do this, please don’t do this,’ but he just ignored me. It was really scary, because those men in there, those other inmates, when they look at me and they look at my breasts, they were screaming and shouting and cheering.</i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>When they put me in the cell, I thought I was safe, but I wasn’t.

However, as she was recounting the experience, the police sergeant stopped her and asked her for sex. Over the next several days, the police officer called her repeatedly, telling her he was ‘horny’ and asking, ‘When are you going to suck my dick?’ He did not provide her with any update on the case. According to Sharan:</span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;

Hezreen filed a police report, but the police asked her to drop the case, and to her knowledge, never conducted investigations. She concluded, ‘I can’t trust the police.

&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Transgender people in Malaysia experience discrimination in access to health care, employment, housing, education, and government services. Employment law, education law, and health care law in Malaysia contain no provisions prohibiting discrimination on any ground, so the only recourse available to Malaysians who experience discrimination in these sectors is the Constitution—which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender, except with respect to education.<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119" id="_ftnref119"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[119]</span></span></span></a> No existing law in Malaysia protects people from discrimination on the basis of their gender identity—nor on the basis of sex or sexual orientation—and negative rhetoric by politicians, government officials, and religious leaders provides cover for those who fail to respect transgender people’s rights. As of this writing, the National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC) had drafted a National Harmony and Reconciliation Bill that would prohibit discrimination on the grounds of gender, including sexual orientation and identity, but the bill had not yet been debated in parliament.<a href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120" id="_ftnref120"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[120]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<h2><b><b><i><span><span>Health Care</span> </span></i></b></b></h2>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Many of the transgender people interviewed by Human Rights Watch had experienced discrimination in the health care sector. They said health workers ogled and commented on their bodies, refused to touch them, or touched their sexual organs unnecessarily, and that they were placed in male or female wards without regard for their gender identity. </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Sharan went to Sungai Buloh government hospital just outside Kuala Lumpur in 2011 for fever, sore throat, and a migraine:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>I went to a nurse at the general hospital. The nurse didn’t want to touch me. She asked me to put in the thermometer myself [in my mouth], then to put it back in the tray, and then she immediately put it in a separate container with lots of Dettol. She taught me how to use the [blood] pressure machine, to squeeze it, tighten it, so that she wouldn’t have to touch me. I felt as if I have a disease—if you touch me, are you going to become transgender as well? </i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>When I told the doctor about it he said, ‘They’re just nurses.’ I said, ‘Yes, but they’re supposed to treat patients properly.’<a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121" id="_ftnref121"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[121]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i><span>She also faced overly curious health workers:</span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>Another time in 2010, I had a migraine. I went to the local [private] clinic, Reddy Clinic, nearby here. The doctor asked me to lie on the examination bed. I said, ‘I have migraine.’ He was checking my crotch area, put his finger in my belly button, and said, ‘I’m checking to see if you have any stomach upset.’ I just walked out—he just wanted to feel me.<a href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122" id="_ftnref122"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[122]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i><span>Ron, a middle-class transgender man in Kuala Lumpur, said that although he found most doctors in the private sector were open-minded, “I </span>had one case of a doctor who checked my pelvic area even though I was there for something completely unrelated.”<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123" id="_ftnref123"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[123]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;

		<p><b><b><i>Many trans people are unable to afford private clinics and instead seek treatment at government facilities, where they may face more serious discrimination. <span>Naz, a transgender woman in Seremban, felt humiliated by health workers when seeking treatment for low blood pressure at Port Dickson General Hospital, a government hospital, in 2008:</span></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>One time I overdosed on hormones. I had low blood pressure. I was raced to the emergency room. My family was there. I was on the bed half awake, aware of what was happening. There were all these trainees, new doctors. They opened my clothes, were pointing at my breasts, asking, ‘Is this a man or a woman?’ I felt humiliated and also embarrassed because my family was there. What mother would want to hear that? I felt very small at the time.<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124" id="_ftnref124"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[124]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Another transgender woman, also known as Nazz, went to a government hospital in Penang for treatment for dengue fever. She said, “I could hear [hospital staff] chatting while I was waiting, ‘Is that a boy or a girl? I think it’s a <i>mak nyah</i>,’ ‘I think it’s a sissy boy.’ It hurt, but I just kept my head down—I don’t want to cause any trouble.” </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>She said that following that experience, “I prefer private [hospitals], even though I have to pay more.

		<p><b><b><i><span>Erina, in Kuala Lumpur, was hospitalized for two days in 2011 for a high fever.  She was placed in a male ward because of the “male” sex marker on her identity card, despite her request to be placed in a female ward. Doctors and nurses quizzed her about her gender identity, asking questions unrelated to the condition for which she was seeking treatment. “They treated me like they treat people with HIV. They were clearly not comfortable,” Erina told Human Rights Watch.</span> <a href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126" id="_ftnref126"> <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> <span>[126]</span> </span> </span> </a> </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Discrimination in the health sector is not across the board, <span>and may reflect individual rather than systematic bias</span>.<a href="#_ftn127" name="_ftnref127" id="_ftnref127"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[127]</span></span></span></a> Some transwomen said that they had encountered positive experiences with doctors and nurses at public hospitals, including one HIV-positive transwoman from Kedah who said her doctor at Sultanah Bahiyah public hospital was supportive of her gender identity.<a href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" id="_ftnref128"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[128]</span></span></span></a> All six transwomen Human Rights Watch interviewed in Kuantan said they had not faced discrimination from health workers. “They treat me like a normal person,” Hafiza explained.<a href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129" id="_ftnref129"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[129]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i><span>But fear of discrimination means some transgender people abstain from seeking medical care. Dorian, an activist who has developed a network of transmen throughout Malaysia, said many who have not fully transitioned are afraid to seek out gynecological services: “</span>For [transmen] who are stealth, they don’t go for Pap smears at all.”<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130" id="_ftnref130"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[130]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Rabisan, a transman who has not undergone sex reassignment surgery and who occasionally engages in sex work with male clients to make money, was anally raped by a client on one occasion. He did not seek medical treatment because he was embarrassed at the prospect of revealing his female genitalia to a doctor: “I was embarrassed. I couldn’t seek help. I would have to explain all these things, reveal my ‘parts.’”<a href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" id="_ftnref131"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[131]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Most of the transgender people we interviewed said that they take hormones to alter their physical appearance and affirm their gender identity. Fearing stigma, most do not seek the support of medical professionals, instead buying over-the-counter hormones with no medical advice. Family Health and Development Association in Penang, one of the few service providers that assists transgender people with hormone intake, found that most participants in its outreach programs were taking excessive doses, which may produce dangerous side effects.<a href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132" id="_ftnref132"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[132]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<h3><b><b><i><span><span>HIV Prevalence and Inadequate Support</span> </span></i></b></b></h3>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Discrimination in the health sector is particularly problematic given transgender women’s vulnerability to HIV.<a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" id="_ftnref133"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[133]</span></span></span></a> It is difficult to estimate HIV prevalence among criminalized populations that are stigmatized and socially marginalized, however the most recent estimate of HIV prevalence among transgender women was 5.7 percent, significantly higher than the 0.4 percent prevalence found among the general population.<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" id="_ftnref134"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[134]</span></span></span></a> Public health experts suggest that this may significantly underestimate the true prevalence.<a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" id="_ftnref135"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[135]</span></span></span></a> In addition, HIV awareness and prevention are believed to be much lower among transgender women than rates measured among the overall population. Teh Yik Koon’s study of 507 <i>mak nyah</i> found that respondents had low levels of awareness of HIV and of condom use, and the majority reported that they did not regularly use condoms.<a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136" id="_ftnref136"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[136]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i><span>An official at an organization conducting HIV prevention work in Penang said,</span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>Transgender women tend not to go to government health facilities, which are free of charge, to seek health care. They’re subjected to people sneering at them, shouting out their male names—even in anonymous HIV screening situations. One transgender woman had staff shout out, ‘This man is going to an anonymous HIV screening!’ So if this continues, no one will ever go for medical screening—if you have a bad experience, you won’t go back.<a href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137" id="_ftnref137"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[137]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>A number of NGOs throughout Malaysia conduct HIV outreach to transgender people, providing the kinds of friendly services they may not find in government hospitals. The federal Department of Islamic Development, JAKIM, has also taken an interest in HIV outreach to transgender people, but their approach is problematic: at times welcoming, JAKIM also uses stigmatizing language and rejects transgender people’s own understandings of their gender identity. For instance, JAKIM’s 2010 “HIV and Islam” manual, published in partnership with the Ministry of Health, recognizes that transgender people may be at risk in part due to stigma, discrimination, low self-esteem, and lack of social support structures, but also professes that they are lacking in “religious comprehension” and need “counseling in sexuality and moral values.”<a href="#_ftn138" name="_ftnref138" id="_ftnref138"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[138]</span></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">Advice for HIV prevention in JAKIM’s manual includes advice like: “Never commit to wrongful sexual acts like adultery, sodomy and lesbianism.

		<h2><b><b><i><span><span>Employment Discrimination</span> </span></i></b></b></h2>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>When asked about her biggest concern as a transwoman, Nazz, a 31-year-old transwoman in Penang, immediately responded, “Jobs.”  She continued:  </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>Most [transgender women] work on the streets as prostitutes because they don’t have any choices. Most are not highly educated. Most have been rejected from jobs. … Malaysia should prohibit this discrimination.<a href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140" id="_ftnref140"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[140]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>The absence of any law protecting Malaysians from employment discrimination based on gender identity or expression leaves women like Nazz—who said she was turned away from several interviews for retail jobs as soon as the employer realized she was transgender—with no recourse in such situations. Beka, from the northern state of Kedah, told Human Rights Watch she had been rejected on the basis of her gender identity more than 10 times by prospective employers, including an international corporation.<a href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141" id="_ftnref141"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[141]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Natasha, a 33-year-old transgender woman in Penang, told Human Rights Watch that despite her efforts to neutralize her appearance and blend in, she still faced job discrimination:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>When I go for an interview, whether a factory, shopping complex, hotel, or anywhere, I dress in a simple way—no make-up; if I have long hair at the time I bun it up.

&#13;
		<p><b><b><i><span>Sharan said she thought that employers were more interested in her body than her job qualifications:</span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>Since [the government] made us seem like aliens, it’s hard to find jobs. When I go for an interview, if the interviewer is male, the first thing he asks me is, ‘Are your breasts real? When did you decide to change?’ I explain I’m a transsexual woman. ‘Do you have a penis or a vagina? Do you have sex with men or women? Which toilet do you go to? Did you do your operation? Why did you choose to take hormones?’ It’s nothing relevant to the job. And it’s not just one place—this has happened at almost every interview I’ve gone to. And then they tell you they’ll call you in two weeks, but you don’t get any phone calls. Or they SMS asking, ‘Are you free tonight?’ There’s no agency that you can report job discrimination to.<a href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" id="_ftnref143"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[143]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;

&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Victoria, a 33-year-old transgender woman from Seremban, has not been fired from a job because of her gender identity, but told Human Rights Watch that when she worked at a petrol station of a global company, she was forced to dress as a man. “That’s not necessary—I know who I am,” she said.<a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145" id="_ftnref145"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[145]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Suvati, a 24-year-old trans woman in Kuala Lumpur, found that not only did one prospective employer treat her in a discriminatory manner, he also called the police on her when she tried to stand up for herself. She went for a job interview at an international call center, where her interviewer, upon realizing she was transgender, began to insult her, calling her <i>pondan</i> and telling her transgender people are a curse:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>He said, ‘You are a she-male, I cannot accept you. The company will get a bad name.’ I started crying and arguing with the guy, trying to explain what problems we go through.

&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Many transgender people in Malaysia, to affirm their identities and to end cycles of arrest and harassment, would like to change the sex marker on their identity cards, and to be officially recognized as the gender with which they identify. Some also seek sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in order to physically alter their bodies. In both cases, they face significant obstacles.</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<h2><b><b><i><span><span>Gender Recognition</span> </span></i></b></b></h2>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Transgender Malaysians have found that it is virtually impossible to change the sex marker on their identity cards (IC). There is no law that explicitly prohibits gender recognition for trans people, but almost all transgender people who are known to have approached the National Registration Department to request such changes have been rejected. A deputy minister in the Prime Minister’s Office told parliament in 2012 that such changes are not permitted even for those who have had sex reassignment surgery.<a href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162" id="_ftnref162"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[162]</span></span></span></a> Nor can transgender people change the names on their identity cards. According to longtime transgender activist Khartini Slamah, name changes were permitted until 1996, when a stricter policy came into place:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>A transsexual undergoing a sex change can add a new name to the birth name, resulting in two names on the identity card: one male and one female. According to the Registry Department, which issues identity cards, this measure is needed to ensure that <i>mak nyahs</i> do not marry men, since Islam forbids sex or marriage between men, and even <i>mak nyahs</i> who have had sex change operations are considered men.<a href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163" id="_ftnref163"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[163]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Courts have issued conflicting opinions as to whether individuals who have undergone SRS can be administratively recognized according to their chosen gender. In the first case, <i>Wong Chiou Yong (P) v. Pendaftar Besar/Ketua Penarah Japatan Pendaftaran Negara </i>(2004)<i>, </i>involving a transgender man who sought to change his official sex to male after undergoing sex reassignment surgery, the Ipoh High Court ruled that “a positive decision in response to this application would conflict with the spirit and intention of the legislature expressed in [the Births and Death Registration Act 1957 and the National Registration Act 1957],” neither of which make any provisions for gender changes except in the case of an “error” in the stated gender on the birth certificate. The bench determined that this was a matter for par­liament rather than the courts, while noting that transsexuals would indeed benefit from laws allowing for gender recognition.<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" id="_ftnref164"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[164]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>However, <i>J.G. v. Pengarah Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara</i> (2005), heard the following year in the Kuala Lumpur High Court, yielded an outcome in favor of the petitioner, a transgender woman who had also undergone SRS. The judge found:</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>[I]n this instant case, the medical men have spoken: the plaintiff is FEMALE. They have considered the sex change of the plaintiff as well as her psychological aspect.

&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Around 1980, a team of doctors and psychologists at the public University of Malaya Hospital began performing sex reassignment surgery on transgender people. Dr. Khairuddin Yusuf, one of the physicians on the team, recalls having performed SRS on at least six transgender patients. When Khairuddin and his colleagues realized that their post-operative patients were having difficulties finding jobs because their bodies no longer matched the sex listed on their identity cards, they successfully lobbied the National Registry Department to change their patients’ sex markers. Then, he said,</i></b></b></p>&#13;
&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>The [National] Fatwa Council heard about it. They expressed concern. We explained the science behind it to them. … Our languages were totally different. They didn’t get the language of science. I understood what Galileo was facing. Science challenges conventional wisdom. I was explaining the importance of transgender people getting jobs, that we have to help our patients. They did not explain their reasoning. … [Our reasoning] was not accepted, so I closed the services. <a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" id="_ftnref169"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[169]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>The fatwa issued by the National Fatwa Council in 1982 against sex reassignment surgery is not legally binding because it was not gazetted by any state. This means there is technically no legal barrier to SRS in Malaysia.<a href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" id="_ftnref170"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[170]</span></span></span></a> However, few hospitals have performed the surgeries since 1982.

&#13;
		<p><b><b><i>Because no facilities currently perform SRS in Malaysia, transgender people who wish to undergo SRS must travel abroad. Many of those Human Rights Watch interviewed had undergone the surgery in Thailand, or were planning to do so. However, many found the cost prohibitive. Those who go to Thailand for SRS generally do not receive any counseling before or after the operation, whereas when SRS was carried out in Malaysia before 1982, trans people who elected to undergo SRS also received counseling.<a href="#_ftn172" name="_ftnref172" id="_ftnref172"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[172]</span></span></span></a></i></b></b></p>&#13;

		<p><b><b><i><span>The Malaysian government is not uniformly hostile toward transgender people. Government bodies, including the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development, the Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM), and the police, have been somewhat receptive to dialogue initiated by trans people and their advocates. In some cases, dialogue is initiated by the authorities themselves, most notably JAKIM, but government approaches that fail to recognize transgender people’s right to be who they are can end up reinforcing stigma and perpetuating mistrust. </span> </i></b></b></p>&#13;

		<p><b><b><i><span>Government religious authorities in Malaysia maintain a relationship with transgender people that is mired in contradictions—perhaps due to diverse beliefs, within JAKIM and in the different states, as to what constitutes an Islamic approach to gender diversity. A JAKIM official, who only agreed to speak to Human Rights Watch on the condition of anonymity, acknowledged that “arresting or punishing anyone is not going to change them.” However, he also claimed that the phenomenon of <i>mak nyah</i> is “new to Malaysia—not more than 20 years,” that it comes from absorbing American media, and that <i>mak nyah</i> can be convinced to “stop being transsexual.”</span> <a href="#_ftn173" name="_ftnref173" id="_ftnref173"> <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> <span>[173]</span> </span> </span> </a> </i></b></b></p>&#13;

&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>We don’t want [Mukhayyam] here. We saw that in Penang and Selangor, they were using it to try to change people. … Their approach is not relevant.

&#13;
		<blockquote><b><b><i>They don’t touch on changing us. They say, ‘As good Muslims you must have some sort of belief.’ They encourage us to pray. They don’t call us sinners.

		<ul><li><b><b><i><i>State cross-dressing laws violate recognized rights to equal protection and freedom of expression, and impose undue restrictions on rights to privacy and freedom of movement for transgender people. </i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
			<li><b><b><i><i>The risk of arbitrary arrest and detention constitutes part of the daily reality of many transgender people. </i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
			<li><b><b><i><i>Those who participate in LGBT organizations and gatherings such as Seksualiti Merdeka (Sexuality Independence festival) have seen their rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly violated. No transgender association has attempted to register since the dissolution of the Federal Territory Mak Nyah Association in 1990. </i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
			<li><b><b><i><i>The government has failed to take meaningful steps to address discrimination on the basis of gender identity, in violation of CEDAW. This includes discrimination in the health care sector, employment, and education.</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
			<li><b><b><i><i>The government has not adopted measures set out in the Yogyakarta Principles to “fully respect and legally recognise each person’s self-defined gender identity.” </i></i></b></b></li>&#13;

		<h2><b><b><i><i><span>Summary of Laws</span> </i></i></b></b></h2>&#13;
&#13;
		<ul><li><b><b><i><i>“Cross-dressing” </i></i></b></b>&#13;
&#13;
				<ul><li><b><b><i><i>All 13 states and the Federal Territory (Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Labuan, governed under one law) prohibit “a man posing as a woman.”</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
					<li><b><b><i><i>In Johor, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Sarawak, Selangor, Terengganu, and the Federal Territory, the law only applies in case of “immoral purposes,” and in Malacca, if “without reasonable excuse.”</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
					<li><b><b><i><i>In Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Perlis, and Sabah, the law applies regardless of the reason for cross-dressing.</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
					<li><b><b><i><i>Three states—Pahang, Perlis, and Sabah—prohibit “a woman posing as a man.”</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
				</ul></li>&#13;
			<li><b><b><i><i><i>Liwat</i> (anal sex)</i></i></b></b>&#13;
				<ul><li><b><b><i><i>10 states and the Federal Territory criminalize <i>liwat</i>.</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
					<li><b><b><i><i>Terengganu passed a Sharia Criminal Offense (Hudud and Qisas) enactment in 2003 that would have punished married offenders with “the punishment of stoning the offender with stones of medium size to death” and unmarried offenders with “the punishment of whipping of one hundred lashes and in addition thereto to one year imprisonment.” However, the law has so far proven unenforceable because it violates limits on Sharia punishments prescribed by federal law. </i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
					<li><b><b><i><i>According to information available on Malaysian government websites, Pahang and Perak do not seem to criminalize <i>liwat.</i></i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
				</ul></li>&#13;
			<li><b><b><i><i><i>Musahaqah </i>(sexual relations between women)</i></i></b></b>&#13;
				<ul><li><b><b><i><i>12 Malaysian states and the Federal Territories criminalize <i>musahaqah.</i> Only Pahang does not. </i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
					<li><b><b><i><i><i>Pengkid</i> (tomboy or tomboy-like behavior)</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
					<li><b><b><i><i>Fatwa committees in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Malacca, Pahang, Perak, and Sarawak have issued <i>fatwas</i> against <i>pengkid.</i> The fatwas have been gazetted and therefore have legal status in Johor, Kedah, Malacca, and Perak.</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
				</ul></li>&#13;
			<li><b><b><i><i>Other “sexual offenses” consisting of consensual sex between adults </i></i></b></b>&#13;
				<ul><li><b><b><i><i>Malacca criminalizes “sexual intercourse against the order of nature” (undefined) as well as “attempt to commit <i>liwat</i>.”</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
					<li><b><b><i><i>Sabah criminalizes “Intercourse Against the Order of Nature” (undefined).</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
					<li><b><b><i><i>Selangor criminalizes “Sexual relations between persons of the same gender” and “Sexual intercourse against the order of nature” (undefined).</i></i></b></b></li>&#13;
				</ul></li>&#13;
		</ul><p><b><b><i><i>The text of all laws in this chart comes directly from the English language version of the Malaysian government websites, E-Syariah Portal and E-Fatwa Portal, unless indicated otherwise. The text of all fatwas was translated to English from the original Malay by Human Rights Watch.</i></i></b></b></p>&#13;

&#13;
						<p><b><b><i><i>Tomboy behavior, women with the image, appearance and characteristics of a man is forbidden in Islam.</i></i></b></b></p>&#13;

						<p><b><b><i><i>Therefore, Muslim parents and the community must pay serious attention to this social sickness and emphasize on Islamic education and impart proper guidance to their daughters, especially in terms of dressing, behavior and appearance so that tomboy behavior phenomena can be avoided and eradicated because it is contrary to human nature and the laws of Allah.</i></i></b></b></p>&#13;

In Kuwait, a provision of the Penal Code prohibits “imitating the opposite sex in any way.” See generally, Human Rights Watch, “<i>They Hunt Us Down for Fun”</i>: <i>Discrimination and Police Violence Against Transgender Women in Kuwait, </i>January 2011, http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/kuwait0112ForUpload.pdf. A 2013 court ruling in Guyana found Guyana’s cross-dressing laws to be unconstitutional, but ruled that cross-dressing could still be prohibited if for “immoral purposes.” Neil Marks, “Guyana court rules cross-dressing is not a crime,” Reuters, September 9, 2013, http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/09/us-guyana-crossdressing-idUSBRE98811V20130909 (accessed May 29, 2014). In Nigeria, several states’ sharia enactments criminalize trans people: for instance, a law in Kano that prohibits “<span>indecent dress that is against the practice of Islam” has been used against transwomen, and Bauchi state prohibits “men dressing as women.” “Islamic police arrest 150 in Nigeria accused of indecent dress, prostitution and cross-dressing,” <i>The Telegraph</i>, October 23, 2013, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/10398365/Islamic-police-arrest-150-in-Nigeria-accused-of-indecent-dress-prostitution-and-cross-dressing.html (accessed August 7, 2014); “Nigeria </span>Islamic court tries 18 for cross-dressing ,” Reuters, August 22, 2007, http://www.stuff.co.nz/oddstuff/7578/Nigerian-Islamic-court-tries-18-for-cross-dressing/ (accessed August 7, 2014). The law in Tonga that prohibits males from “impersonating” females have never been enforced.

Samoa decriminalized cross-dressing in 2013. See: Anna Leach, “‘Impersonating a woman’ decriminalized in Samoa,” post to “images on concrete words on paper” (blog), May 2, 2013, http://imagesonconcretewordsonpaper.wordpress.com/2013/05/02/impersonating-a-woman-decriminalized-in-samoa/ (accessed June 16, 2014). An Italian ordinance against unauthorized wearing of “disguises” has been used to prosecute transwomen—the last known case was in 1976—and laws against cross-dressing are on the books in Paris, but are not enforced. Email communication from Carla LaGata, Transgender Europe, to Human Rights Watch, June 14, 2014. In the United Arab Emirates, a vague law on “indecent acts,” article 358 of the Penal Code, is used regularly to convict transgender people or people who are cross-dressing. See, for example, Salam al Amir, “Filipino fashion professionals jailed for cross-dressing in Dubai,” <i>The National</i>, June 17, 2014, http://www.thenational.ae/uae/courts/filipino-fashion-professionals-jailed-for-crossdressing-in-dubai (accessed June 17, 2014).  Saudi Arabia has arrested and sentenced people to flogging and imprisonment for cross-dressing, despite having no written law prohibiting it.  See: Human Rights Watch, “Saudi Arabia: Drop ‘Cross-Dressing Charges,’” June 24, 2009, http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/06/24/saudi-arabia-drop-cross-dressing-charges.</i></i></b></b></p>&#13;

Terengganu attempted to ban <i>liwat</i> (anal sex) in a <i>hudud</i> criminal enactment in 2002. <i>Hudud </i>is a form of Islamic law that applies to crimes mentioned in the Quran and includes punishments of stoning to death, flogging, and amputation. The <i>hudud</i> enactment passed by Terengganu’s legislative assembly provides for sentences of death by “stoning the offender with stones of medium size” for married men, and whipping of 100 lashes plus one year’s imprisonment for unmarried men, who engage in <i>liwat</i>. However, the act cannot be enforced, as it contradicts the federal Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965 (Incorporating all amendments through 2006), which provides limits on punishments that can be meted out by state sharia courts; See text box, “A Dual Legal System,” above. The Pahang Syariah Criminal Offences Enactment 2013 criminalized cross-dressing for the first time in the state, but did not criminalize <i>liwat </i>or <i>musahaqah. </i>Jabatan Agama Islam Pahang (Pahang Islamic Religious Department), Official Portal, “List of Shariah Law Offences,” http://jaip.pahang.gov.my/index.php/perkhidmatan/penguatkuasa/senarai-kesalahan-undang-undang-syariah (accessed August 8, 2014). </i></i></b></b></p>&#13;

<p><a id="public-url"></a> <strong>Public URL</strong> - This is the URL that points to the root of this IPT installation. The URL is set automatically during the installation of the IPT. The Public URL must be accessible via the Internet in order for the IPT to function fully. Configuring the IPT Public URL to use localhost, for example, will not allow the instance of the IPT to be registered with GBIF, will not allow the IPT to be associated with an organization and will not allow the resources to be publicly accessible.</p>

<div class="title">Manually updating the Public URL</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IPT tests the Public URL for accessibility from the client computer when the IPT Settings are saved. If the IPT is not accessible at the given Public URL, the IPT will display a warning message and the changes will not be saved. The procedure to change the Public URL if the new URL is not yet functional (such as a port change that requires the IPT to be restarted) is given here:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>shut down the IPT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the data directory for the IPT, open the file <code>config/ipt.properties</code> with a simple or programming text editor such as Notepad, TextEdit, vim (not Microsoft Word).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the <code>ipt.properties</code> file, change the line starting with <code>ipt.baseURL</code> to the new URL with the new port, using the backslash to escape the colon character. For example, enter <code>ipt.baseURL=http\://example.org\:7001/ipt</code> for <a href="http://example.org:7001/ipt" class="bare">http://example.org:7001/ipt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>restart the IPT in the servlet container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>update the metadata for the IPT as described in the next section of this user manual entitled "Publish all resources".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Institutional proxy URL</strong> - If the server on which the IPT is installed does not have direct HTTP/HTTPS access to the Internet, but instead must route outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests through an institutional proxy server, enter the host address and port number here.  For example, <code><a href="http://proxy.example.org:8080" class="bare">http://proxy.example.org:8080</a></code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Analytics key</strong> - If you would like to track the use of your instance of the IPT with Google Analytics, you can enable it to do so by entering your Google Analytics key in this text box. For more information about Google Analytics, see <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/" class="bare">https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debugging Mode</strong> - Check this box if you would like the IPT to begin logging in the verbose debugging mode. Debugging mode is generally unnecessary unless you are trying to track a problem with the IPT. The IPT log file is located in the file debug.log in the IPT&#8217;s data directory. The data directory is set during the first step in the installation process (see the Getting Started Guide). Refer to the information under the "View IPT logs" heading of the "Administration Menus" section for an easy way for users having the Admin role to view the debug.log file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Archival Mode</strong> - Check this box if you want your IPT to archive all published versions for all resources. It will enable you to track a resource&#8217;s version history. If unchecked, older versions will be overwritten with the latest. Beware not to run out of disk space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Number of archived versions</strong> - When archival mode is enabled, setting this configuration value to a number will keep that many old versions, but automatically delete older versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IPT Server Location</strong> - This area of the page allows the Admin to set the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the location of the server on which the IPT is installed. Setting these coordinates allows GBIF to map the location of this among other registered IPT installations around the world.</p>

<p>This option is an administrative action just like the Publish button, only it publishes ALL resources. Therefore for each resource, it creates a new DwC-A, EML, and RTF, and broadcasts the update to the Registry and via RSS. In addition, it also updates the IPT and registered resources' metadata in the Registry. Click on this button if multiple resources have been updated and you want to publish a new release for all of them instead of publishing them individually.</p>

<p>This page allows a user to register the IPT instance in the GBIF Registry if this has not already been done. The IPT must be registered before any of the IPTs resources can be associated with an organization (see the information under the "Configure Organizations" heading in the "Administration Menu" section) or published (see the <a href="manage-resources#published-versions" class="xref page">Published Versions</a> section). Information about a registered IPT and its public resources become searchable through the Registry&#8217;s services, and the data from the public resources published on the IPT can be indexed for searching via the GBIF portal. If the IPT has already been registered, the registered information for the IPT can be edited opening the <a href="#edit-gbif-registration">Edit GBIF registration</a> page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step to register with GBIF is to test that the IPT has a valid URL that can be reached by the GBIF services. To run this test, click on the button labelled "Validate".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the validation test is unsuccessful, an error message will suggest the nature of the problem with the communication between the GBIF Registry and the IPT. Causes for an error include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No Internet connectivity</strong> - The IPT requires an active Internet connection to function properly. An error will occur if connectivity to the Internet is lost when the button labelled "Validate" button is clicked. Restore Internet connectivity before trying to proceed with registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incorrect Public or Institutional proxy URL</strong> - The public URL is automatically detected and configured during the IPT setup process (see the <a href="initial-setup" class="xref page">Initial Setup</a> section). Changes in the configuration of the server on which the IPT is installed could require a change in the public URL or the institutional proxy URL. The public and institutional proxy URLs can be changed on the Configure IPT Settings page (see the explanations for public URL and institutional proxy URL in the <a href="#configure-ipt-settings">Configure IPT settings</a> section).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firewall</strong> - If the Internet connection is live, a firewall may be preventing connections to the public URL or institutional proxy. Change the firewall or institutional proxy settings to all outside connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GBIF Registry inaccessible</strong> - If an error message suggests that none of the previous errors has occurred and yet there is a failure to communicate with the GBIF Registry, please report that there are problems connecting to the GBIF registry to the GBIF Help Desk (<a href="mailto:helpdesk@gbif.org">helpdesk@gbif.org</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Organization</strong> - the select box contains a list of organizations in the GBIF registry. Select the single organization with which this IPT instance will be associated. If you are unable to find the organization you seek on the list, use the GBIF Registry (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/publisher/search" class="bare">https://www.gbif.org/publisher/search</a>) to determine if the organization is registered under a name other than what you expected. If the organization is not yet registered with GBIF, please contact the GBIF Help Desk to register the organization before proceeding with the registration of the IPT. Click on the help icon and then click on the helpful GBIF Help Desk link to open up an email template in your default mail client that you just have to fill in the required information before sending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organization&#8217;s shared token</strong> - the shared token registered in the GBIF registry for the selected organization must be entered in this text box to verify that the user has the authorization required to associate the IPT instance with that organization. If you do not have to the organization&#8217;s shared token, you can request it from the registered contact. A link to the primary contact on record for the organization will appear below the Organization&#8217;s Shared Token text box after selecting an organization in the Organization select box. The shared token will be used to authenticate the IPT registration when the button labelled "Save" is clicked.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This page allows a user having the Admin role to enable the instance of the IPT to import and share various pre-defined types of data from the GBIF Registry. Each type includes properties (fields, terms) that support a specific purpose. For example, the Darwin Core Taxon Core Type supports information pertaining to taxonomic names, taxon name usages, and taxon concepts and allows the IPT to host resources for taxonomic and nomenclatural checklists. A distinction is made between Core Types and extensions. Core types provide the basis for data records, (Occurrence, Taxon, and Event for example) while extensions provide the means to associate additional data with a record of the Core Type. Only one Core Type can be selected for a given resource as explained under the "Darwin Core Mappings" heading of the "Resource Overview" section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vocabularies contain lists of valid values that a particular term in a Core Type or Extension can take. For example, the <a href="https://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/dwc/basis_of_record_2022-02-02.xml">Darwin Core Type vocabulary</a> contains all of the standard values allowed in the Darwin Core term <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#basisOfRecord">basisOfRecord</a>.</p>

If the extension is out-of-date, another button labelled "Update" will also appear. In the right-hand column is a summary of the information about the extension, including a brief description of the type of data the extension is meant to accommodate, a link to more information about the extension if it exists, the date it was issued (released), the number of properties (fields, terms) in the extension, the name of the extension, its namespace, RowType, and keywords. For more information about these attributes of an extension, see the documentation on Darwin Core Archives at <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/" class="bare">http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/</a>.

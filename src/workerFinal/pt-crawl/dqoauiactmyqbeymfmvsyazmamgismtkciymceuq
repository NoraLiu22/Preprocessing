The <SPAN CLASS="whole">Seventy-first</SPAN> Discourse: On the Philosopher
			</H3>

	<P CLASS="justify">
In this Discourse Dio examines the statement that "the philosopher should be remarkable in everything." As examples of versatility he considers Hippias of Elis, the well-known sophist, and Odysseus, each of whom exhibited a high degree of skill in both intellectual and manual pursuits. While admitting their claim to excellence, Dio maintains that the philosopher should be able to excel all men above all in "acting, or not acting, advantageously, and in knowing when to act and where and the right moment better than the craftsman, and also in knowing what is possible of achievement." This dictum

is illustrated by reference to Daedalus and other skilled artificers, who failed of real excellence because they were ignorant in just those respects. The Discourse concludes with a sarcastic allusion to Nero's varied ambitions.

The <SPAN CLASS="whole">Seventy-first</SPAN> Discourse:
	<BR>
On the Philosopher
	</H2>


	<P CLASS="start justify">
There are those who say that the philosopher should be remarkable in everything in any surroundings; moreover, they say that he should be very able in conversation with men and never keep silent or be at a loss before those in his company for lack of such language as will be capable of pleasing them; otherwise, they say, he who is not thus equipped is an ignoramus and worth but little. But I say that, though some of their statements are just and truthful, some are not. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2">2</A> For that the philosopher should in every situation be superior to all others, it seems to me they are right in demanding — unless they mean that he must not only know all the crafts but also, in accordance with the rules of the craft, produce everything better than the craftsmen, both building houses and making boats and working as a smith and weaving and farming. For example, Hippias of Elis claimed to be the wisest of the Greeks, for both at the Olympic Games and at the other national gatherings of the Greeks he produced poems of every style and speeches which he had composed of divers kinds, but he also displayed other products of his — <!-- Loeb has two dashes here -->his ring, his oil-flask and strigil, his mantle, and


<A ID="p165"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p165 </SPAN></A>his girdle — boasting that he had made them all himself, displaying them to the Greeks as a kind of firstfruits of his wisdom.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3">3</A> And Homer too, I venture to remark, has represented Odysseus, not merely as <SPAN CLASS="whole">pre-eminent</SPAN> and judgement and in his ability to plan concerning practical matters, not merely as a most able speaker,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref2" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/71*.html#note5
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">5</A> and especially, since his father was a very careful and experienced farmer, it was to be


<A ID="p167"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p167 </SPAN></A>expected that Odysseus would not be ignorant of these matters, yes, he even challenges Eurymachus to a contest in both reaping and ploughing.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref6" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/71*.html#note6
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

onMouseOut="nd();">7</A>

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="5">5</A> Very well, in these respects no doubt Hippias and Odysseus were a clever pair; but I say that the philosopher, while unable to know every one of the crafts — for it is difficult to be thoroughly proficient in the practice of even one — nevertheless could do everything, no matter what he might be doing, better than anybody else, even though from the point of view of the crafts, if he really is ever compelled to <SPAN CLASS="whole">tackle</SPAN> anything of that nature, he is not superior when measured by the standard of <SPAN CLASS="whole">craftsman</SPAN>&shy;ship. For this is an impossibility, that the layman should produce anything better than the joiner by the standard of the joiner's craft, or that one who lacks experience in farming should be found more expert than the farmer in performing any of the tasks of the farmer.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6">6</A> Wherein, then, would the philosopher be superior? It would be in his acting, or not acting, advantageously, and in his knowing when to act and where and the right moment better than the craftsman, and also in his knowing what is possible of achievement. For instance, I believe that Daedalus did not build his Labyrinth in Crete well — entering which his fellow citizens, both male and female, met their death&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref8" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/71*.html#note8
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">8</A> — for he did not build it justly. And besides, in abetting the malady of Pasiphaë he wrought not


<A ID="p169"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p169 </SPAN></A>rightly; for it was not advantageous nor was it just or honourable to lend such aid or to invent devices for ends which were shameful and impious.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref9" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/71*.html#note9
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">9</A> And even when he equipped Icarus with wings — if we are to believe the tale — I say he did not do well to invent this device; for he was attempting the impossible when he attached wings to a human being. Accordingly he wrought the death of his son.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="7">7</A> But apparently Homer too says harsh things of a certain builder among the Trojans, as not having done well when he built for Alexander the ships with which he sailed to Hellas — though he has no fault to find with him on the score of <SPAN CLASS="whole">craftsman</SPAN>&shy;ship. For this is what he says:

not lauding him for his construction of the ships, but rather censuring him much more severely than if, by saying that he had made the ships either slow or with some other defect, he had censured him for <SPAN CLASS="whole">ship-building</SPAN>. And Homer in similar fashion censures also a certain huntsman&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref11" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="8">8</A> From these illustrations, therefore, it is evident that there is need of wisdom and virtue as applied both to what men know and also to what they do not know; and thus it is that the prudent man, such as the philosopher should be, would in everything be superior to all the world, whether in doing any of these things or in not doing, no matter how he performs according to the standards of the craft. But that he will paint better than the painter when not himself a painter; or that he will tend the sick better than the physician, as measured by the standards of art, when himself not a physician; or that he will sing more musically than the musicians when unacquainted with the art of music or only slightly acquainted; or that he will show himself better versed than the arithmeticians in the theory of numbers, or than the surveyors in surveying, or than the farmers in planting, or than the pilots in piloting; or that he will slaughter an animal more expeditiously than the butchers, or, should it be necessary to cut it up, do so more expeditiously than those who have made this very thing their profession — such things are not to be expected.

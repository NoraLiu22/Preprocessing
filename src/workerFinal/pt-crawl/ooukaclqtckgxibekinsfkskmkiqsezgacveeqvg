A small group interested in multimedia, education, and digital libraries met on Saturday, September 12, 1998 just prior to the ACM Multimedia '98 Conference in Bristol England to explore issues related to the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant: Curriculum Resources in Interactive Multimedia (CRIM) (<A HREF="http://www.cstc.org/~crim/">http://www.cstc.org/~crim/</A>). This grant, awarded by NSF's Division of Undergraduate Education to Virginia Tech, with a subcontract to The George Washington University, is a two-year effort, which began early 1998. Its goal is to build a digital library of educational resources to support teachers and learners interested in multimedia and to facilitate preparation of curriculum in the multimedia field.&nbsp; CRIM is closely allied with another project,&nbsp;Computer Science Teaching Center (<A HREF="http://www.cstc.org/~cstc/">http://www.cstc.org/~cstc/</A>), which is developing a digital library of resources (including lab activity descriptions, visualizations, and visualization tools) in the computing field.&nbsp; Both CRIM and CSTC have many aims in common with the NSF effort to build a digital library to support undergraduate Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education (SMETE) Library; see <A HREF="http://www.dlib.org/smete/">http://www.dlib.org/smete/</A>).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Co-principal investigators Fox and Heller led the one-day workshop attended by participants from Egypt, Germany, Luxemborg, and the USA.&nbsp; Results of the meeting were presented at the Annual Meeting of SIGMM on Tuesday, September 15th, as part of the SIG's Education Committee report.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In addition to preparing a plan to develop, refine, and build consensus on curricula related to multimedia, the workshop recommended collecting resources for the digital library through some interesting techniques, including:</P>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>developing a relationship between this effort and the ACM Digital Library, so that eventually the two digital libraries are closely allied;<p></LI>
<LI>asking those presenting papers, posters and demonstrations at ACM Multimedia '98 to contribute to the CRIM repository;<p></LI>
<LI>setting up a special part of the ACM Multimedia '99 programs of demonstrations and posters, to focus on those that have pedagogical value, soliciting submissions from educators; and<p></LI>
<LI>seeking donations to give awards to those non-commercial submissions that have the greatest pedagogical value.</LI></UL>

<P>The digital library supporting CRIM and CSTC is being developed at Virginia Tech based on work on the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD); see <A HREF="http://www.ndltd.org/">http://www.ndltd.org</A>.&nbsp; Metadata is tagged in accordance with the Dublin Core. OCLC is providing technical assistance.</P>

<P>Tidal Zone Associates, Inc. announces the availability of a free demonstration version of its WebTide metadata management system, which enables users to create, organize, and edit the information that describes their data holdings. WebTide proposes to simplify the painstaking process of complying with metadata standards by using graphical user interfaces that have built-in attribute definitions, valid values, and table structures.</P>
<P>The WebTide Limited Demonstration Edition is now available on the Tidal Zone web site (<A HREF="http://www.tidalzone.com/downloads.html">http://www.tidalzone.com/downloads.html</A>) in both Macintosh and PC versions. The demo contains limited versions of WebTide's two standalone tools: "Create Tables" and "Enter Metadata". The "Create Tables" tool is used by metadata managers to customize WebTide to their enterprise needs. The WebTide demo implements the Federal Geographic Data Committee's Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata by providing data entry screens for all required information, and by allowing creation of custom data entry screens for optional information. The "Enter Metadata" tool allows users to easily build, change, import, export, and validate metadata records.</P>
<P>"We developed WebTide because the other metadata entry tools on the market presume a lot of knowledge on the part of the person using them," says Tidal Zone president Cheryl Croft. This made sense in the past, when there was a smaller community of people with expertise in their data model responsible for entering metadata into their organization's data systems. But that role is changing now that metadata standards are becoming more pervasive. For instance, the FGDC standard is now required by 13 government agencies, and is widely used by other organizations as well. "There are a lot of people providing the information that don't have in-depth knowledge of the metadata model or the standard, but they do have expertise on the data," says Croft. "We put in a lot of help features and guidance so these occasional users could become experts readily."</P>
<P>WebTide features not included in the Limited Demonstration Edition include the 'Map Schema' tool, used for migrating legacy metadata into new management systems. The full WebTide solution, available later this year, can be obtained in both standalone and client-server modes. WebTide is also fully configurable, and can be customized to implement any data model or standard, and to work with any database management system. </P>
<B><P>FGDC Tables Publicly Available</P>
</B><P>In addition, Tidal Zone Associates has developed a set of HTML tables that contain FGDC definitions, attributes, and terms that make navigation of this information easier for metadata managers who use the FGDC standard. Tidal Zone is sharing these tables with the FGDC community and is making them publicly available through their web site.</P>
<P>The FGDC definitions were extracted from the original documentation and organized into three HTML tables. One table provides the definitions for the compound elements, or "groups" of metadata attributes. The second table contains the definitions of each attribute, along with the metadata values that are valid for the attribute. The third table contains a glossary of terms used in the group or attribute definitions. Hyperlinks have been created between these three tables so that a user can more readily locate the descriptions and context of the individual terms employed in the FGDC metadata standard. </P>

In 1996, the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Science Resources Studies (SRS) and the Computation and Social Systems Program in the Foundation's Division of Information and Intelligent Systems asked the National Academy of Sciences to explore existing evidence about the social and economic outcomes of computing and communications and to establish a baseline for possible further study. The project report, "Fostering Research on the Economic and Social Impacts of Information Technology," has now been completed and is available on the National Research Council web site at (<a href = "http://www2.nas.edu/cstbweb">http://www2.nas.edu/cstbweb</a>). The report includes findings from the workshop convened for the project, background papers prepared for the workshop, and an extensive bibliography.

The SRS effort is summarized in "Impacts of Information Technologies" which has been up-dated and placed on the SRS web site (<a href = "http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/stats.htm">http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/stats.htm</a>). Click on "Data Briefs and Reports" and then look under "Special Reports and Papers." An earlier SRS paper, "Charting the Impacts of Information Technology," is also posted under "Special Reports and Papers" on the SRS site. It provides a preliminary overview of the analytical challenge inherent in assessing the impacts of information technologies and an informal summary of the kinds of impacts that have been identified in prior work.

The Nordic Council for Scientific Information, NORDINFO (<a href = "http://www.nordinfo.helsinki.fi">http://www.nordinfo.helsinki.fi</a>) has supported the Nordic metadata project
(<a href = "http://linnea.helsinki.fi/meta">http://linnea.helsinki.fi/meta</a>), the first international project to build Dublin Core-based tools. This report describes the project. Expert organisations from all Nordic countries co-operated in order to solve a set of common problems and provide new kinds of services suitable for all of them (and also for users outside Scandinavia). The applications developed in the project are being actively used in Scandinavian countries in national or regional metadata initiatives. In June, NORDINFO, which funded 50% of the Nordic metadata project, decided to support also a follow-up project, Nordic metadata II. This two-year project will start in the autumn.

This conference is the second of a series of European conferences on research and technology for digital libraries funded by the European Commission's TMR Programme. It is organized by the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM), by the Institute of Computer Science of the Greek Foundation for Research and Technology -- Hellas (FORTH) and by the University of Crete. The Conference will convene until the afternoon of Wednesday 23 September.</P>
<P>A digital library constitutes a quantum quality leap over a simple electronic collection of books and journals. It is an active super-entity composed of active or passive information objects that live scattered around the world and are accessible through the Worldwide Web. Examples of such information objects are: documents in digital form together with their readers' annotations and the responses of their creators; sounds and pictures -- moving or still -- with their descriptions and their annotations; programs with their animation graphics and sample inputs for experimentation; collaboration environments for research (e.g., teleguidance of a roaming underwater autonomous vehicle off the Mediterranean coast and collection of its measurements to feed a mathematical model for the prediction of coastal pollution) or entertainment (e.g., virtual reality games on the Internet).</P>
<P>The Alexandrian "daughter library" was established about 235 BC by Ptolemy III in the Temple of Sarapis, with the ideal of an international library --  incorporating not only all Greek literature but also translations into Greek from the other languages of the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and India. The scholars of Alexandria had immediate access to an enormous collection of works by the standards of their time. In theory, all these works were accessible by the scholars even without the library -- provided they found a copy of the work they were searching somewhere in the world, something practically impossible most of the time.</P>
<P>In a similar way, an abundance of information objects lives, evolves, grows and dies in the ocean of the Worldwide Web. In theory, humans can seek them through Internet's "search engines". And if they are lucky enough find them, interact with them. However, in reality, this has become increasingly difficult, as the number of objects and the size of Internet grow geometrically with time. </P>
<P>A digital library acts as an agent for both humans and information objects in cyberspace. The creators of the information objects can entrust their creations to the digital library, which safeguards their authenticity, protects them from plagiarism, and ensures their promotion and evolution as conceptual artifacts that interact with others in the world. The digital library informs all entities, human or otherwise, about the information objects that it supports. It negotiates and enters into contractual agreements with other digital libraries for the exchange of access rights to objects. </P>
<P>This drastically new understanding of libraries is expected to have a dramatic social and economic impact worldwide. Creators' intellectual property rights, publishers' commercial rights, the very nature of publishing, citizens' access rights, the nature of the public library and the museum are some of the areas that are being reexamined and redefined. The enforcement of the access rights of the citizens of the emerging Information Society becomes paramount, through access techniques tailored to the individual needs, capabilities, dexterities and requirements of the users.</P>
<P>Our Conference aims to become an international Forum -- not simply European -- where these important issues can be discussed among researchers from multiple disciplines whose science relates to the development of digital libraries; to provide an opportunity for these scientists to form a research community in Europe specific to digital library development; to enable review and discussion of research under way in Europe, the USA, Japan and other countries on digital libraries; to establish a forum for discussion of issues specific to Europe such as interoperability, multilinguality, intellectual property policy, and electronic commerce.</P>
<P>Participation has tripled since last year and there are 450 participants coming from 45 different countries. Out of 107 submitted papers, 35 were accepted after rigorous evaluation by an international Program Committee. </P>

<h3>What is Alzheimer's Disease? </h3> In 1986, President Ronald Reagan's
"I don't remember," "I don't recall" responses seemed to many to be lame
answers to questions about political dealings.  However, it turns out that
they may have been the truth. In 1994, former President Ronald Reagan
announced that he had Alzheimer's disease (AD).</td> <td align=center><img

<td>Alzheimer's disease attacks the brain; it is not a normal part of
aging. People with AD have a gradual memory loss and difficulties with
language and emotions. The progressive loss of intellectual abilities is
termed <font color=red>dementia</font>.  As the disease advances, the
person may need help in all aspects of life: bathing, eating, and using
the restroom.  Because
of this round-the-clock care, families and friends of people with AD are
greatly affected.  The disease is irreversible and
there is currently no cure.</td></tr></table><p>

<h3>Who Gets AD? </h3>

About 5-6% of the US population has AD or a related dementia.  This means
that approximately four million Americans have AD. As the population ages,
the burden to caregivers and cost to society will grow.  It is estimated
that by 2050, 14 million people in the US will suffer from AD.<p>

Alzheimer's disease ranks fourth in the cause of death among adults. About
100,000 people die per year as a result of AD. Five to 10 percent of the
population over age 65 have AD.  At the age of 85 and older, about 50%
have AD. Although age is a factor, research has shown that genetics also
play a role.  Because women tend to live longer than men, more women
are affected by AD than men. Furthermore, 80% of caregivers are women, so
they are also secondarily affected by the disease.</td> <td

<td><h3>Symptoms</h3>

Memory loss, especially of recent events and newly acquired information,
is perhaps the most noticeable trait of AD. The first symptoms have a
gradual, subtle onset, and can be a sign of many dementias, not just AD.
For example, a person may become lost in familiar surroundings, forget
whether a task was done, repeat the same story, or is unable to learn new
things. As the disease worsens, the person may be unable to find the right
word or to make responsible decisions.</td></tr></table>

<table bgcolor="#ffffcc" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 border=0><tr><td>
One of the most painful aspects of the disease is that the person
sometimes will not recognize friends or family members.  Personality
changes can occur, such as unusual agitation, paranoia, depression, and
social withdrawal. Later, people with AD may wander, or be unable to find
their way home. New research, however, has shown that a part of the brain
that processes visual and spatial information may be damaged in people
with AD.  This may account for the problems AD patients have with
orienting themselves.) Patients may also become inattentive, thus unable
to care for their day-to-day bodily needs.  Other parts of the brain
including the basal forebrain and hippocampus, areas important for memory,
are also affected by AD.  Many AD sufferers die from other causes such as
pneumonia. From the time of diagnosis, AD patients generally live 6-8
years, although many live for as long as 20 year after the diagnosis. <p>

The symptoms of AD vary tremendously from person to person, but in time,
each person who has AD will experience worsening symptoms. Many of the
behavioral changes associated with AD - depression, paranoia, and
delusions - can be helped with medication. However, there is no cure for
AD, although some treatments hold promise.</td> <td align=center>Areas of

<h3>A Closer Look at an AD Brain</h3>

The microscopic changes that occur in the brain of a person with AD
were first noted by German neurologist <font color=blue>Alois Alzheimer</font> 
in 1906. He performed an autopsy on a woman who
had become more and more confused in the years preceding her death.  He
called the changes he observed in her brain <font color=red>plaques</font>
and <font color=red>tangles</font>. These features can only be seen upon
autopsy. Tangles and plaques interfere with neuronal functions, such as
communicating with each other and sending messages to other parts of the
body.<p>

Research suggests that the formation of tangles in the
brain may be a part of the normal aging process. Dr. John Morris of
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, published
a report titled "Tangles and plaques in nondemented aging and preclinical
Alzheimer's disease" in the March 1999 issue of <I>Annals of
Neurology</I>, Volume 45 Number 3, pages 358-368. This study showed that
of the 39 nondemented people (people with no behavioral evidence of
Alzheimer's disease), all had tangles in their brains. So perhaps
developing tangles is an inevitable part of growing old. "This is further
evidence that there is such a thing as truly healthy aging and that
Alzheimer's disease is not inevitable," states Morris. More
research is
needed to figure out what role tangles and plaques play in AD. Are only
plaques responsible, or do tangles and plaques interact?<p>
 
Other observed changes in the brain affected by AD include:<p>
<ul>
<li>neuronal degeneration in a part of the brain called the <font
color=red>nucleus basalis of Meynert</font>. 
<li>decreased brain levels of the neurotransmitter <font
color=red>acetylcholine</font>. </ul></td>

<table bgcolor="#ffffcc" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 border=0><tr><td>
<h3>Neurofibrillary Tangles</h3>

It is unclear how neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) form. NFTs are found
inside of the neuron: the neurons themselves become deformed and clump
together. NFTs have been described as looking like a rope tied in knots. A
protein named <font color=red>tau</font> has been shown to be involved in
forming NFTs, but more research is needed to solve the mystery of how and
why NFTs form, and how exactly they affect the brain.<p>
 
<h3>Plaques</h3> 

Unlike tangles, plaques occur outside the neuron. Plaques are mainly
composed of a protein called <font color=red>beta amyloid</font>, although
other proteins contribute to plaque formation. Research has shown that a
protein in our bodies called <font color=red>amyloid</font> plays a
significant role in AD. Proteins are vital molecules that control all
sorts of processes in our body.  The amyloid protein occurs naturally in
our brains, but as we age, too much of it (in a form called beta amyloid)
accumulates in the brain, forming <font color=red>plaques</font>. Beta
amyloid is formed when an enzyme clips the amyloid precursor protein; beta
amyloid, a fragment from this process then aggregates in deposits. It is
unknown whether these deposits are due to excess production or whether the
enzymes that usually break it down are not functioning properly. This
situation is similar that of cholesterol in our bodies.  Some cholesterol
is needed to keep our cells healthy, but too much cholesterol can block
arteries and lead to heart attacks and other problems.</td>

<h3>Drug Therapies</h3>
<img src = "./gif/smartpil.gif" width="148" height="72" hspace=15
vspace=15 align=right>

Four drugs for treating AD have been approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA): <a 
href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a697032.html">Donepezil 
(Aricept)</a>, <a 
href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a602009.html">rivastigmine 
(Exelon)</a> and <a 
href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a699058.html">galantamine 
(Razadyne)</a> are used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and 
<a 
href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a604006.html">memantine 
(Namenda)</a>, is used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's.  
Doneprezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are drugs classified as 
cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the breakdown of 
acetylcholine by blocking the action of cholinesterase, the key enzyme in 
the breakdown of acetylcholine. Both drugs increase the level of the 
acetylcholine in the brain. These drugs also slow memory loss and help the 
person perform daily tasks. Memantine is a NMDA receptor antagonists that 
decreases abnormal activity in the brain.  This drug can help people think 
and remember. It is important to note that all of these drugs are not a 
cure, they only lessen the symptoms of AD.  <p>

Many other drugs for treating AD are awaiting approval from the US FDA.<p>

<h3>Other Therapies</h3> <ul> <li><font color=red>Vitamin E (an 
antioxidant) and aspirin (an anti-inflammatory)</font> are being 
considered as treatments. How each works to lessen the symptoms of AD is 
not clear. It has been suggested that Vitamin E protects the nerve cell 
membranes from damage by a harmful chemical process called oxidation.<img 
src = "./gif/drugques.gif" width=100 height=123 vspace=15 hspace=15 
align=right> <p>

<li>Studies have shown that some <font color=red>architectural designs 
</font>help AD patients.  For example, buildings with circular floor plans 
allow AD patients to wander until they find their room. Signs reminding AD 
patients to do certain tasks can help focus attention.  Having the same 
schedule each day can also aid the AD patient's memory.<p>

<li>Some studies have shown modest effects of the plant Ginkgo biloba on
the symptoms associated with AD.<p>

<li>A very controversial surgical treatment for AD has been reported by 
Dr. Harry S. Goldsmith at the University of Nevada School of Medicine. He 
places part of the <font color=red>omentum</font>, a fatty membrane in the 
abdomen which holds organs in, on the brain. This has been shown to 
improve short-term memory in AD patients, perhaps because of a chemical in 
the omentum.  Further research is warranted to explain how (and if) this 
surgery works.</ul> </td></tr></table><p>

<h3>Expanding Diagnostic Tools</h3> Because a definitive diagnosis of AD 
can only be made by examining the brain after a person dies, AD diagnosis in
the living must be made by exclusion.  This means that other diseases must 
be ruled out as
a cause of the dementia.  There is no single test to show that a person
has AD, but several tests can suggest the presence of AD.<p>
<ul><LI>When analyzing
cerebrospinal fluid, an elevated level of certain proteins, including
amyloid beta protein, may indicate that a person is likely to have AD. 
<li>As imaging technology becomes more sophisticated and accessible, 
health professionals can use CAT scans to visualize brain shrinkage.  A 
brain with widened sulci (the indentations on the surface of the brain), 
and enlarged cerebral ventricles (the spaces in the brain which are 
filled with CSF) - all characteristics of AD (and other neurological 
disorders). 

<li>Brain imaging methods can also be used to gain information about blood
flow and metabolic activity in various parts of the brain.</ul><p>

<h3> Risk Factors</h3> First and foremost, the chance of developing AD
increases with age. With each additional year of life, there is increased
likelihood that one will display symptoms of AD. Alzheimer's disease
affects men and women about equally, and strikes all ethnic groups. <p>

There are actually two types of AD: familial (early onset) and sporadic
(late onset).  Familial AD is a rare form of AD that affects a small
subset of people at a younger age, usually before their fifties. It has a
strong genetic component: mutations on genes 21, 14, and 1 cause a
predisposition to AD.(Reported in <i>Neurology</i>, July 1998.)<p>

Sporadic (late-onset) AD is the type most people are familiar with.
It affects people most often after they reach 65 years of age. A gene called
ApoE on chromosome 19 has been pinpointed as being a risk factor for AD.</td>

<h3>What Can You Do to Protect Your Brain As You Age?</h3> As you age,
some connections in your brain may fail due to tangles or plaques, so it
makes sense that the more neural connections you have overall, the more
you will be able to compensate for the damaged connections.  It's like a
sports team.  If one player gets injured and there is a
qualified player on the bench who can substitute, the team will still
function well. The more players available to play for injured team
members, the better the team will fare.<p>

How do you get and maintain neural connections? It is thought that staying
active, both mentally and physically, will help.  Challenge your mind.
Remember people's names. Work crossword puzzles.  Do math. Read. Learn new
words.</td>

<h3>Future Research</h3> 

Understanding Alzheimer's disease is one of the most active areas in
neuroscience research. In 1998, scientists took a big step forward by
breeding mice that develop the symptoms of AD. These mice will help
researchers unravel the mysteries of AD. Research into future treatments
can be divided into several categories. <p>

<h3>Chemical Theories</h3> <ol><li><font color=red>Biochemical Changes in
the Brain</font><br> Brain
cells need certain nutrients to grow.  One of these nutrients is called
NGF, for
nerve growth factor. A decrease in NGF could contribute to AD. Experiments
on rats have shown that NGF promoted growth of new synaptic connections in
a part of the brain called the hippocampus. This new growth, in theory,
could help restore memory loss. The flip side to chemicals which help
neurons grow are the chemicals which kill neurons. These chemicals are
neurotoxic.  Perhaps an increased level of neurotoxins contributes to the
disease. If levels of these neurotoxic substances could be regulated,
fewer neurons would die, thus lessening the symptoms of AD.<p>

<li><font color=red>Neurotransmitter Deficiencies in the Brain</font><BR>
Neurons
use neurotransmitters to communicate.  As mentioned previously,
acetylcholine levels are lower in AD brains compared to non-AD brains. It
has been shown that drugs with the side effect of lowering acetylcholine
can cause temporary memory loss. Thus, drugs which promote increased
levels of acetylcholine in the brain may slow the dementia.<p>

<li><font color=red>Toxic Chemical Excesses in the Brain</font><br> In the
past, aluminum, mercury and other metals found in the brain tissue of AD
patients caused speculation that these compounds contributed to the
disease. Most scientists agree that aluminum and other metals probably do
not cause AD, although they result from the disease process.  Further
research is needed to clarify these metals' role in AD. </ol><p>

<h3>The Genetic Theory</h3> The genetics of AD are confusing at best. Some
families may have many members affected, but because family members may be
exposed to the same environment, it is impossible to say how much heredity
is to blame. Several genes have been identified on chromosomes 21 and 14
in the familial type of AD. In the more common sporadic type, people with
a gene for a protein called apolipoprotein E on chromosome 19 tend to have
a higher incidence of AD than the general population. Much more work needs
to be done to fully understand how genetics influences the incidence of
AD.<p>
<img src = "./gif/bact.gif" width=125 height=125 align=left vspace=15
hspace=15>
<h3>The Autoimmune Theory</h3> Your immune system fights off infection
from bacteria, viruses, and other threats to your well-being. If this
system goes awry, your immune system can attack its own tissue. Scientists
hypothesize that if your immune system attacks your brain as you age,
AD symptoms could result. However, it is unclear whether this leads to AD,
because signs of this type of attack have been seen in non-AD brains.<p>

<h3>The Slow Virus Theory</h3> Some brain disorders which cause symptoms
similar to AD are caused by slow viruses.  However, no one has identified
a virus specific for AD.  <p></td> <td align=center><img src =

The early British settlers introduced sheep into Tasmania in commercial
numbers around 1820.&nbsp; The breed of choice was the small but hardy
Merino, renowned for the fine quality of its wool.&nbsp; In a matter of
a few short years, pastoralists began to unfairly brandish the thylacine
as a vicious sheep killer, and the flame of persecution was ignited.</font></font></td>

<i>"Van
Diemen's Land News"</i>, published in The Australian newspaper of the 22nd
November 1826 (p. 2), are the early stirrings of resentment against the
thylacine that would eventually lead to the introduction of the various
bounty schemes:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One of these ferocious
looking animals, which, in appearance, much resemble a tyger about the
body, and wolf about the head, was a few days since killed by some sheep
dogs on the farm of Mr. Nairne, at the Coal River.&nbsp; When it was opened,
two young lambs were found in its inside, apparently not long been devoured.&nbsp;
It was<font color="#000000"> remarkably</font> fat and large; and is now
lying at the stores of Mr. Bethune, at the Wharf.&nbsp; We never before
understood that these species of animals (male &amp; female), are in a
certain respect formed by nature similar to the kangaroo.&nbsp; The females
bring forth their young in the same manner, and have also a false belly,
in which they for some short time carry their progeny.&nbsp; Although these
animals are by far less numerous than the native dog in New South Wales,
if the increase of them is not stopped in time, they may become formidable.&nbsp;
We would suggest then, that a reward of some description should be given
by the Government to pay everyone who shall destroy and bring into town
a native tyger or hyena".</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thylacines killed
sheep there is no doubt, as historical witness will testify:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Last week a male
animal of the same species of that which some time ago destroyed a number
of sheep on the premises of E. LORD, Esq., at Orielton Park, made its appearance
among the flock of Mr. G. W. EVANS, Deputy Surveyor General; at Bagdad;
it had at different times within a week killed thirty sheep.&nbsp; It was
attacked by seven dogs, and made a stout resistance, till at length it
was killed with an axe by the stock-keeper".</font></i>

HYENA - On Sunday last, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, as one of the
shepherds belonging to Mr. Edward Abbott, jun. was looking after his master's
flock, while grazing at his farm, at Russell's Falls, near New Norfolk,
the sheep were suddenly frightened at the sight of one of these ferocious
animals.&nbsp; They immediately ran down a hill; and the man, having a
dog with him, soon perceived the Hyena pursuing the flock right a-head,
when he made a sudden spring among the sheep, and fastened upon a lamb,
which he immediately killed.&nbsp; The man then ran up with his dog; but
the Tyger made off before he could reach the spot: the dog however shortly
after came up with the Hyena, when he turned round and attacked the dog,
who, with the assistance of his master, at last managed to kill him.&nbsp;
The lamb was rather large, about 6 months old.&nbsp; The Tyger measured
6 feet from the nose to the extremity of the tail; and is the second one
that has been killed on nearly the same spot within the last twelve months".</font></i>

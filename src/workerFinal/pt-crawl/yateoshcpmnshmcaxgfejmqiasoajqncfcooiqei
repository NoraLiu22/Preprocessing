The bats with which most people are familiarbelong to the <i>Microchiroptera</i>. Microchiropterans, or "microbats,"generally nagivate by sending out pulses of high-frequency sound andhearing the echos. They tend to have short faces and well-devloped tails,and lack a claw on the second finger. Microchiropterans are found everywhereon earth except the polar regions.</p>	<table width="260" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="right">	  <tr>	    <td><img src="/images/dot_clear.gif" width="10" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td><img src="bat_art.jpg" width="250" height="366" border="0" vspace="4" alt="Megachiropteran"></td>	  </tr>	</table><p>The <i>Megachiroptera</i> includes the so-called fruitbats and flyingfoxes of the tropical forests of India, Africa, Asia, and Australia.The picture at right shows a typical megachiropteran.Megachiropterans have a claw on the second finger of thewing. They include the largest known bats; Indonesian flying foxes mayhave wingspans of up to six feet (two meters). They have longer muzzlesthan microbats (hence the name "flying foxes" for some species) and, whilea few species can navigate by echolocation, fruit bats generally navigate bysight and have large, light-sensitive eyes. Most fruitbats are helplessin total darkness but can see very well in dim light.</p><h3>Which other mammals are related to the bats?</h3><p>While bats are highly specialized for flight, they share anatomical characterswith the Insectivora, the mammalian taxon that includes shrews and moles.These characters, however, are probably <i>symplesiomorphies</i>, fundamentalto mammals as a whole, and not indicating a close relationship betweenbats and insectivorans.</p><p>Bats are thought to be related most closely to the Dermoptera, a smallorder of mammals (two species) which includesthe colugos or "flying lemurs" of the Phillippines. Colugos do not fly, but canglide using a web of skin stretched between their arms and legs, ratherlike flying squirrels (to which they are not closely related). Perhapssurprisingly, bats are also related to the<a href="primates.html">Primates</a>, the mammal taxonthat includes lemurs, monkeys, apes, and humans; and to the Scandentia, theAsian tropical tree shrews. All these mammals are sometimesclassified together in one large taxon, the Archonta.Find out more about bats and how they relate to other mammals at the <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Chiroptera&contgroup=Eutheria">Tree of Life</a> site.</p><p align="center"><a href="/help/WebLiftComb.map"><img src="/images/WebLiftComb.gif" ISMAP border="0"></a></p><p align="center"><a href="auchiroptera.html"><img src="/images/authors.gif" width="68" height="23" hspace="3" alt="Authors"></a><a href="/copyright.html"><img src="/images/copyright.gif" width="23" height="23" hspace="3" alt="Copyright"></a></p></td>  </tr></table><!--#include virtual="/footer1.html"--><!--#include virtual="/sitesearch.html"--></body></html> contentType 9 text/html url 58 https://ucmp.berkeley.edu:443/mammal/eutheria/chirosy.html responseCode 3 200

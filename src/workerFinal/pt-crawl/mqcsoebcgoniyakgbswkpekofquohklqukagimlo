where the center of the fold is placed across the saddle in the machine and wire staples are driven through and clenched on the inside, </i>side stitch</i>, where the thread or wire is stitched through the side of the fold;

<i>single stitch</i>,

<font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">

Reel-fed offset litho printing. Three main systems of presses exist blanket-to-blanket in which two plate and two blanket cylinders per unit print and perfect the web of paper or board; three-cylinder system in which plate, blanket and impression cylinders operate in the usual manner to print one side of the paper or board;

and satellite or planetary systems in which two, three or four plate and blanket cylinders are arranged around a common impression cylinders to print one side of the web in several colours.

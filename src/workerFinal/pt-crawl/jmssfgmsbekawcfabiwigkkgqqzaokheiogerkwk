/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br /><font color="#990000">[[p. 3]] </font><b>I. Why Doctors are not the Best 
        Judges of the Results of Vaccination.</b> 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) In the first place they are interested parties, 
          both pecuniarily and in a much greater degree on account of professional 
          training and prestige. Only three years after vaccination was first 
          introduced, on the recommendation of the heads of the profession, and 
          their expressed conviction that it would give lifelong protection against 
          a terrible disease, Parliament voted Jenner &pound;10,000 in 1802, and 
          &pound;20,000 more in 1807, besides endowing vaccination with &pound;3,000 
          a year in 1808. From that time doctors as a body were committed to its 
          support; it has been taught for nearly a century as an almost infallible 
          remedy in all our medical schools; and has been for the most part accepted 
          by the public and the legislature as if it were a well-established scientific 
          principle, instead of being as the historian of epidemic diseases--Dr. 
          Creighton--well terms it, a grotesque superstition.
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Whether vaccination produces good or bad results 
          can only be determined by its effects on a large scale. We must see 
          whether, during epidemics <font color="#990000">[[p. 4]]</font> --at 
          different periods or in different places--small-pox mortality is diminished 
          as compared with that from other diseases in proportion to the total 
          amount of vaccination; and this can be done only by the Statistician, 
          using the best materials--in this country those of our Registrar-Generals. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the greatest medical authorities on vaccination, 
          Sir John Simon and Dr. Guy, F.R.S., have declared this to be necessary. 
          The former, in 1857, in a Parliamentary Report on the <i>History and 
          Practice of Vaccination</i>, says: &quot;From individual cases the appeal 
          is to <i>masses of national experience</i>.&quot; Dr. Guy, in a celebrated 
          paper published by the Royal Statistical Society, says: &quot;Is vaccination 
          a preventive of small-pox? To this question there is, there can be, 
          no answer except such as is couched in the language of figures.&quot; The 
          language of figures is &quot;Statistics&quot;; hence, statisticians, not doctors, 
          are the only good judges of this question. But the last Royal Commission 
          consisted wholly of doctors, lawyers, politicians and country gentlemen, 
          not one trained statistician! Hence, as I have demonstrated in my <i>Vaccination 
          a Delusion</i>, they have made the grossest blunders and their Report 
          is absolutely worthless.<br />
          &nbsp; 
      </p><p><font color="#990000">[[p. 5]] </font><b>II. What is Proved by the 
          Best Statistical Evidence Available.</b> 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The only complete and trustworthy records of 
          mortality and of the causes of death which we possess, are those of 
          the Registrar-Generals for England and Wales, for Scotland and for Ireland; 
          the former from 1838, the two latter from later dates. But for London 
          we have records from a much earlier period--the <i>Bills of Mortality</i>, 
          which, though not completely accurate, are yet considered to show the 
          rise and fall of the death-rates from the chief diseases then recognised, 
          with sufficient general accuracy to be very valuable. They are continually 
          appealed to in order to show the enormous improvement in the health 
          of London in the nineteenth as compared with the eighteenth century, 
          and this comparison as regards small-pox is one of the stock arguments 
          of the doctors, and was strongly urged by the Royal Commissioners. It 
          is stated over and over again that, down to the year 1800, small-pox 
          deaths were excessive, but that from the very introduction of vaccination 
          in 1800 they began to decrease, and have been getting less and less 
          ever since. No other disease, it is said, has decreased in the same 
          striking manner.
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) This being the very foundation of the supposed 
          evidence in favour of vaccination it is necessary to examine it closely, 
          when it will be found to be wholly <i>worthless</i>, and to illustrate 
          in a striking manner the complete ignorance of doctors, and also of 
          the Royal <font color="#990000">[[p. 6]]</font> Commissioners, of the 
          very elements of statistical enquiry. This requires some little explanation, 
          though it is really a very simple matter. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to be able to study the effect of any alleged 
          cause of improved health of the community, we must compare the death-rates 
          before and after the introduction of the supposed cause of improvement 
          (in this case vaccination), and also compare these with the death-rates 
          from other groups of diseases, and from all causes. These facts are 
          given by the Registrar-General in tables showing the number of deaths 
          each year in each million of the population. Now, small-pox, many fevers, 
          cholera, etc. are what are termed epidemic diseases, which attack large 
          populations at irregular intervals with great severity, while at other 
          times they are far less fatal or more local. Hence the yearly death-rates 
          vary enormously. In 1796 more than 4,000 per million died of small-pox 
          in London, while in the next year there were only about 800, and the 
          following year (1798) over 3,000. Again, in 1870 less than 100 per million 
          died of it, while in 1871 there were about 300, and in 1872 about 2,500. 
          Thus the figures go increasing and decreasing so suddenly and so irregularly, 
          that by taking only a few years at one period, and a few at another, 
          you can show an increase or a decrease according to what you wish to 
          prove. Hence it is often ignorantly said that figures can be made to 
          prove anything. But this is quite untrue. They can often be made to 
          <i>show</i> anything, which is quite another matter; but if properly 
          exhibited and compared they lead to one conclusion only; they show <i>the 
          truth</i>.
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#990000">[[p. 7]]</font> (3) There 
          are a few simple rules for getting at the truth in such statistics as 
          we are now discussing. One is that we must take as long <i>periods of 
          time</i> as possible; another is that we must use the<i> largest</i> 
          populations available. Two other conditions are almost equally important; 
          we must compare, when possible, equal periods before and after vaccination 
          was introduced; and we must also compare the increase or diminution 
          of <i>small-pox</i> with those of <i>other diseases</i>, in order to 
          discover whether there is anything exceptional in the decrease of small-pox 
          mortality which requires a peculiar cause to explain it. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the ever-varying figures in long columns are 
          so confusing to most people, that it is impossible to make anything 
          out of them, and to simplify them, averages have to be taken, showing 
          the deaths every five or every ten years, and in other ways, so as to 
          find out what the figures really mean, and even then, by altering the 
          <i>periods</i> or beginning <i>at different years</i>, a very different 
          result may often be shown.
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) By far the best way and that usually adopted 
          by statisticians and mathematicians, is to draw out diagrams by which 
          the whole course of the mortality from each disease or group of diseases 
          can be seen and compared at a glance. From the various elaborate tables 
          given in the Reports of the Royal Commission and from the annual reports 
          of the Registrar-General, I constructed twelve diagrams, each showing 
          the comparative rise or fall of small-pox mortality and other diseases 
          in various places and under different conditions; and all these without 
          exception <i>demonstrate</i> either that vaccination has no <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          8]]</font> effect whatever, or that it tends to <i>increase</i> rather 
          than decrease <i>small-pox mortality</i>. These are all given in my 
          little book &quot;Vaccination a Delusion,&quot; which can be had from the National 
          Anti-Vaccination League for 9d. a copy, or 10&frac12;d. by post. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) As many people do not understand these diagrams 
          I here give a part of one of them in a simplified form in order to render 
          statistical diagrams intelligible to all, and it will serve to show 
          what is the nature of the evidence against vaccination, and also how 
          I prove that the statements made by the doctors and by the Royal Commissioners 
          are not only misleading but absolutely untrue. <font color="#990000">[[note:

      </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) The figures on the bottom and top of the diagram 
          show the years, from 1770 to 1830, while those on the right and left 
          show the number of deaths to each million of population. The three wavy 
          lines show the <i>proportion of deaths</i> to population during this 
          period of 60 years; the lower line the <i>small-pox</i> deaths; that 
          next above it the deaths from the other <i>zymotic diseases</i> (fevers, 
          diphtheria, whooping-cough, etc.); while the top line shows deaths from 
          <i>all diseases</i>. These last deaths, being so much more numerous, 
          have had to be drawn out on a smaller scale in order to show them on 
          the same page as the others.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7) This diagram shows us that small-pox decreased 
          during the ten years before vaccination at very nearly the same rate 
          as it did in the ten years after vaccination. The other zymotic diseases 
          <font color="#990000">[[p. 10]]</font> decreased even more than small-pox 
          during the ten years after vaccination. General mortality also decreased 
          after 1800 more rapidly than before 1800. Yet the Royal Commissioners 
          declare that there was <i>nothing</i> but vaccination to produce the 
          decrease of small-pox, and that there was no improvement in sanitation 
          in the beginning of the nineteenth century, as compared with the latter 
          part of the eighteenth century, to account for the difference. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8) Now, in an Appendix to my &quot;Vaccination a Delusion,&quot; 
          I have given an account of a number of improvements affecting health 
          at this very period which are amply sufficient to produce the results 
          shown by the diagram, and I believe it is the most compact and most 
          interesting account of these improvements yet given. The chief of them 
          are (1) That many West-end squares and suburbs were built at this very 
          period, and were inhabited chiefly by city people. (2) That the streets 
          were more systematically cleaned and the roads improved. (3) That the 
          water supply was much improved. (4) That potatoes, tea, and coffee came 
          into more general use; while the better roads allowed more fresh meat, 
          vegetables and milk to be used. (5) Cemeteries were formed outside London 
          and many City graveyards were permanently closed. The result of these 
          five groups of improvements was strikingly shown in the decrease of 
          the death-rate in a number of the most fatal diseases (as recorded in 
          a Table by Dr. Farr, reprinted in the Third Report of the Royal Commission) 
          to fully one-half in 1801-10 as compared with 1771-80; an amount of 
          <font color="#990000">[[p. 11]]</font> improvement which has never occurred 
          in any similar period during the whole of the 270 years for which we 
          have official statistics. And yet the Royal Commissioners declare that 
          nothing <i>but vaccination</i> can explain the corresponding and very 
          similar decrease in small-pox! 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9) As you will now understand the method of exhibiting 
          statistics by means of diagrams, I will proceed to state the other more 
          important conclusions to be drawn from our national statistics of death-rates. 
          Those who wish to study them more fully must obtain the book itself, 
          and examine the diagrams and the full details there given.<br />

          Registration. 1838-96.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) These tables show us that neither the general 
          mortality nor that from zymotic diseases decreased much till about 1868, 
          but from that date there has been a large and continuous decrease. Small-pox 
          had a sudden increase in 1838, in which year the mortality was greater 
          than it had been for the preceding twenty-five years. Then it decreased 
          slowly till 1870, and this decrease is always ascribed by the doctors 
          to vaccination. But in 1871 there was a great epidemic, when the mortality 
          was greater than at any period during the preceding seventy years of 
          constantly increasing vaccination! Since 1871 small-pox has decreased, 
          but only at about the same rate as the other zymotic diseases. The interesting 
          thing to note here is, that the Main Drainage of London was completed 
          in 1865, and about five years later (the time required for the connection 
          of all the house drainage) the marked diminution in the mortality above-mentioned 
          began to show itself. And if we average the enormous small-pox mortality 
          of 1871 with that of the preceding ten years, we shall find that it 
          will bring the small-pox mortality into almost exact correspondence 
          with that from all other causes, and thus leave nothing to be imputed 
          to vaccination!
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) In another diagram in my book I show the mortality 
          from the five groups of zymotic diseases taken separately: Fevers, Whooping-cough, 
          Diphtheria and Scarlatina, Measles, and Small-pox, for <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          13]]</font> the same period of Government Registration. All of these 
          diseases show a nearly similar decrease in the latter half of the period, 
          except measles, which shows hardly any diminution; but there is reason 
          to believe that the cause of this is, that, when vaccinated children 
          after a short illness die of small-pox, measles or chicken-pox are often 
          given as the cause of death.<br />

        </p><p><font color="#990000">[[p. 14]]</font><b> IV. Death-Rates in England 
          and Wales during the Period of Registration.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) My third diagram is one of the most instructive 
          and conclusive in my book, because it deals with the whole population 
          of England and Wales and the death-rates from various groups of diseases 
          as in the illustrative diagram. In the first twenty-five years, from 
          1848 to 1872, there is on the average hardly any decrease either of 
          general mortality, zymotics, or small-pox, since the enormous small-pox 
          mortality of 1871-72 if distributed over the preceding ten years will 
          bring it to correspond closely with the other classes of mortality. 
          But from 1873 to 1895--the last twenty-three years shown--there is a 
          diminution in all three of the diseases to a considerable amount. For 
          the last ten years the diminution in small-pox is the greatest; but 
          this can be proved to be <i>not</i> due to vaccination, as I will now 
          explain.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) It is only from the year 1872 (after the great 
          epidemic of small-pox) that all vaccinations, private as well as public, 
          have been officially registered, and a table showing their amount has 
          been given in the Final Report of the Royal Commission. From 1872 to 
          1882 the vaccinations amounted to 95 per cent. of the births; practically 
          <i>all</i> were vaccinated if we allow for those that died before they 
          could be operated on or very soon afterwards. But from that date the 
          number of vaccinations steadily decreased, till in 1895 they were only 
          80 per cent. of the births, <font color="#990000">[[p. 15]]</font> a 
          diminution of 15 per cent. in fourteen years. If vaccination were the 
          chief or only preventive of small-pox we ought to have a considerable 
          <i>increase </i>of the disease during this period, instead of which 
          it is in this period only that the diminution of small-pox has been 
          <i>more marked</i> than that of the other zymotic diseases! Here, then, 
          we have the first distinct proof that it is vaccination which <i>keeps 
          up the disease</i>, and that when a larger number of children escape 
          the blood-poisoning lancet small-pox diminishes! 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another and even more conclusive proof is given 
          on page 2 (back of the title-page) by Dr. Ruata, M.D.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
          The whole male population of Italy are revaccinated on entering the 
          army. Under the age of 20, men and women are <i>alike </i>as regards 
          vaccination; afterwards men have an <i>enormous advantage</i>, if vaccination 
          is of any use. Yet, over 20, many <i>more</i> men than women die of 
          small-pox, while under 20 the mortality is equal, again demonstrating 
          that vaccination <i>increases</i> small-pox mortality!<br />

        </p><p><font color="#990000">[[p. 16]]</font><b> V. Thirty Years of Rapidly 
          Decreasing Vaccination in Leicester, and its Teachings.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The great manufacturing town of Leicester, with 
          nearly 200,000 inhabitants, affords the most conclusive proof of the 
          uselessness of vaccination that it is possible to have; and the doctors 
          and government officials carefully avoid dealing with it except to prophecy 
          evils which have never come to pass.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down to 1872 Leicester was one of the most completely 
          vaccinated towns in the kingdom, the number of vaccinations, owing to 
          alarm after epidemics, several times <i>exceeding</i> the number of 
          births. Yet in 1871, at the very height of its good vaccination record, 
          it was attacked by the epidemic with extreme severity, its small-pox 
          deaths during that year being more than 3,500 per million of the population, 
          or about a thousand per million <i>more</i> than the mortality in London 
          during the same epidemic. If ever a test experiment existed it is this 
          of Leicester, where an almost completely vaccinated community suffered 
          more than unvaccinated and terribly insanitary London, on the average 
          of the last forty years of the eighteenth century.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even more conclusive evidence is to come.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) That fearful mortality destroyed the faith of 
          Leicester in vaccination. Poor and rich alike, the workers and even 
          the municipal authorities began to refuse vaccination for their children. 
          This refusal continued till, in 1890, instead of 95 per cent. the vaccinations 
          reached only 5 per cent. of the births! <font color="#990000">[[p. 17]]</font> 
          As this ominous decrease of vaccination went on the doctors again and 
          again prophesied against it, that once small-pox was introduced it would 
          run through the town like wildfire and decimate the population. Yet 
          it <i>has</i> been introduced again and again, but it has never spread; 
          and from that day to this no town in the kingdom of approximately equal 
          population has had such a very low small-pox mortality as this almost 
          completely unvaccinated and--as the doctors say--<i>unprotected</i> 
          population! Surely this completes the demonstration that vaccination, 
          instead of preventing, increases the liability to small-pox, and that 
          the only way to abolish the disease is to do as Leicester did, leave 
          off vaccination altogether and devote our energies to sanitation, and 
          the isolation of such rare cases as do occur. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet this wonderfully conclusive test experiment 
          was passed over by the Royal Commissioners in 1894, with a few scattered 
          remarks, which are either absolutely untrue or entirely beside the question.

          Demonstration of the Uselessness of Vaccination.</b> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The doctors always claim that, though the effect 
          of vaccination in infancy wears out, yet re-vaccination offers an almost 
          complete protection for the rest of the person's life. In a circular 
          issued in 1884, and up to the time of the Royal Commission widely distributed 
          <i>with the approval</i> of the <i>Local Government Board</i>, it is 
          stated that: &quot;Soldiers who have been re-vaccinated can live in cities 
          intensely affected by small-pox without themselves suffering to <i>any 
          appreciable degree</i> from the disease.&quot; I will now show you that this 
          official statement is <i>absolutely false</i>.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) All soldiers and sailors are re-vaccinated on 
          entering the service, unless they have recently had small-pox. The reports 
          of the Royal Commission give the small-pox deaths in the Army and Navy 
          from 1860 to 1894. The Registrar-General gives the total mortality from 
          disease in the two services for the same period. I have compared these 
          two mortalities by means of a diagram constructed from the tables, and 
          this is what we find. First, throughout the whole period the total mortality 
          from all diseases in the Army is much higher than in the Navy. Clearly, 
          this is the result of the one class living in barracks, largely in towns 
          and cities, the other in the midst of the pure and bracing sea air.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second place, there has been, in both <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          19]]</font> services, throughout the thirty-four years a continuous 
          diminution of mortality, so that it is now only about one-third of what 
          it was thirty-four years ago; and this enormous improvement is stated 
          by the Army and Navy doctors to be due to the much better <i>sanitation</i> 
          of ships and barracks, and to the great improvement in the <i>food</i> 
          and general <i>treatment</i> and <i>medical</i> attention in both services. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, in both Army and Navy there has been a 
          large decrease in the small-pox mortality throughout the whole period, 
          corresponding closely with that of the general mortality, and certainly 
          due to the same causes--improved sanitation and medical treatment.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, in the very same years (1871-2) as the 
          great epidemic in England and on the Continent, there was also a small-pox 
          epidemic both in the Army and the Navy, and taking account of the age 
          of the men and their condition of constant medical supervision, quite 
          as severe as among the general population, who had <i>not</i> the alleged 
          <i>complete protection</i> of re-vaccination.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, this is proved by two comparisons--with 
          Ireland and with Leicester--from tables given in the Reports of the 
          Royal Commission extending from 1864 to 1894. The diagrams formed from 
          these tables show us that Irishmen of about the <i>same ages</i> as 
          our soldiers and sailors suffered more during the epidemic of 1872, 
          but for the remainder of the thirty years they had rather less small-pox 
          mortality; while since 1881 they have had <i>not half the small-pox 
          mortality</i> of the Army and Navy.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#990000">[[p. 20]]</font> (3) The other 
          comparison is with Leicester, which city, in the period of twenty years 
          (1873-1892), during which they had been growing less and less vaccinated, 
          has had a total of only 16 small-pox deaths per 100,000 of its population, 
          which includes thousands of unvaccinated children and infants; while 
          for the same period the deaths in the Army and Navy amounted to over 
          70 per 100,000. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet we have had the impudently false statement 
          circulated by thousands, under the approval of the Local Government 
          Board, that the re-vaccinated Army and Navy do not, under the worst 
          circumstances, &quot;appreciably suffer!&quot; The Royal Commissioners, on the 
          other hand, shirk the whole matter--make no comparisons with other populations--but 
          state vaguely that &quot;particular classes&quot; who have been &quot;exceptionally&quot; 
          re-vaccinated exhibit &quot;quite exceptional advantages in relation to small-pox,&quot;--a 
          statement which, as regards the only &quot;exceptionally&quot; re-vaccinated large 
          classes of men, is, as their own tables show, the very reverse of the 
          truth, since they suffer much more than the least vaccinated class of 
          about equal population in the whole kingdom.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thus absolutely demonstrated that it is the 
          exceptionally <i>unvaccinated</i> that possess the exceptional advantages, 
          while the &quot;exceptionally <i>re-vaccinated</i>&quot; Army and Navy show quite 
          exceptional <i>disadvantages</i>, in a small-pox mortality during the 
          same twenty years, more than <i>four</i> times as great as the exceptionally 
          <i>unvaccinated</i> town of Leicester!
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the learned men of the Royal Commission never 
          put these two facts side by side, so that the <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          21]]</font> Government and the public might draw their own conclusions 
          from them. So far as their Final Report shows, these gentlemen were 
          ignorant or oblivious of the very existence of these facts, which conclusively 
          prove that Vaccination is not only <i>worthless</i> but an <i>injurious</i> 
          operation--a Gigantic Medical Imposture! 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) For the reasons now stated, we call upon voters 
          of all parties to refuse support to every candidate who upholds the 
          legal or other enforcement of vaccination, which, as we have shown, 
          both spreads disease and increases mortality. No government has the 
          right to order healthy infants to be blood-poisoned, under the pretence 
          of protection against a danger that may never arise. The abolition of 
          all laws enforcing or encouraging vaccination is therefore of more immediate 
          and vital importance than any party dogma or any political programme.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) In my &quot;Vaccination a Delusion&quot; I have given 
          examples of the grossest misstatements of doctors and officials from 
          the time of Jenner down to the present day. They are such as often appear 
          to be incredible, but none of them have ever been disproved. Several 
          have been given here; but there is one more which is so universal that 
          it must be briefly referred to. In all Official Reports of small-pox 
          epidemics the fatality of the unvaccinated is always declared to be 
          enormous as compared with the vaccinated. As an example, Dr. Gayton, 
          in a Table published in the Second Report of the Royal Commission, gives 
          the percentage of deaths to cases as follows:--
        </p><center>
          <p>Vaccinated--7.45 per cent.<br />
            Unvaccinated--43.00 per cent.
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all the medical writers on small-pox during 
          the eighteenth century agree in stating that the average death-rate 
          of small-pox patients was then from fourteen to eighteen per cent. At 
          that time, however, the sanitary state of our towns and hospitals was 
          abominable, while the medical treatment of small-pox was so incredibly 
          bad that it is a wonder any survived. Yet the doctors ask us to believe 
          that <i>now</i>, with far healthier conditions and with far better treatment 
          and nursing, more than <i>twice</i> as many unvaccinated small-pox patients 
          die as died <i>then</i>, when <i>all</i> were unvaccinated! The thing 
          is absolutely incredible and absurd; and the belief in it is due solely 
          to the fact that doctors register all deaths from small-pox as <i>&quot;unvaccinated&quot;</i> 
          when they can possibly find any excuse for doing <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          23]]</font> so. One of them has stated that &quot;the mere assertions of 
          patients or their friends that they were vaccinated counts for nothing.&quot; 
          The alleged enormous mortality of the unvaccinated is further shown 
          to be erroneous by the fact that the published Reports of three of the 
          largest small-pox hospitals for London from 1876 to 1879 showed that 
          the average small-pox mortality of all patients was about 18 per cent., 
          or a little higher than during the eighteenth century. This may be explained 
          partly by the fact that many of the milder cases do not go to the hospitals, 
          and partly by the weakening of the constitution due to the blood-poisoning 
          operation of vaccination, which, when conditions are alike, renders 
          the vaccinated less able to resist small-pox than the unvaccinated. 
          It has been well asked: &quot;If about 36 per cent. of unvaccinated patients 
          die of small-pox while only about 18 per cent. died in the eighteenth 
          century who or what kills the other 18 per cent.?&quot; It cannot be the 
          general conditions, since the mortality from all diseases has greatly 
          diminished. There remains only the medical treatment. Do doctors accept 
          this? 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Now if any one brings forward doctor's or official's 
          figures as to the enormous value of vaccination, ask them first the 
          above questions. They will deny the facts. Then, in my book you will 
          find the official authority for these and all the other facts referred 
          to. They will be obliged to say they have never enquired into them, 
          and you may then tell them that they have no right to teach you who 
          <i>have</i> enquired into them.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a medical man to deal with, ask him 
          why he does not admit Sir John Simon's statement, that &quot;<i>the great 
          masses of national experience</i> can alone prove the value of vaccination.&quot; 
          Then <font color="#990000">[[p. 24]]</font> show him the diagrams (in 
          my book) which I have here referred to, and ask him to prove that they 
          show &quot;great benefits of vaccination,&quot; instead of showing as they do 
          its absolute worthlessness. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) As to its terrible dangers, the thousands of 
          lives vaccination has destroyed or ruined as regards health, I have 
          no space to refer to them here, but ample evidence from the Royal Commission 
          Reports is given in my book.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Doctors and Members of Parliament are alike 
          grossly ignorant of the true history of the effects of vaccination. 
          They require to be taught; and nothing is so likely to teach them as 
          to show them the diagrams I have referred to in this short exposition 
          of the subject--those of <i>London</i> for thirty years before and after 
          vaccination--of <i>England and Wales</i> during the period of official 
          registration--of <i>Leicester</i> which has almost abolished small-pox 
          by refusing to be vaccinated for thirty years--and for the <i>Army and 
          Navy</i>--which, though thoroughly <i>re-vaccinated</i> and therefore 
          (according to the doctors) as well protected as they possibly can be, 
          yet die of small-pox at least as much as badly vaccinated Ireland, and 
          many times more than unvaccinated Leicester.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A doctor who <i>has not</i> studied these most vital 
          statistics has no right to an opinion on this subject.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A candidate for Parliament who <i>will not</i> give 
          the necessary time and attention to study them, but is yet ready to 
          vote for penal laws against those who know infinitely more of the question 
          than he does, is utterly unworthy to receive a single vote from any 
          self-respecting constituency.</p>

          &quot;There is another consideration which has a certain relation with vaccination 
          and small-pox in the Italian Army. Our young men are obliged, by law, 
          to enter the Army at the age of twenty, so that the greatest part of 
          them pay this tribute to the State. The consequence is that, after the 
          age of twenty years, men are by far better vaccinated than women, and 
          after the age of twenty small-pox should kill less men than women. I 
          wished to ascertain if this were true, and here are the figures representing 
          the numbers of deaths from small-pox in men and in women before and 
          after the age of twenty during our great epidemical years, 1887-88-89:--

  <strong><em><font color="993366">Comment by Professor Giacomo Scarpelli, Rome, Italy 
            (pers. commun. 10/00):</font></em></strong></p>
          
      <p><i>During the decades surrounding the start of the Twentieth Century, 
        Victorian society was jolted by a civil movement against the smallpox 
        vaccination program imposed by the English Government. A preconceived 
        fear of the artificial inoculation of the virus in the human body produced 
        a reaction from both the common people and the clergy--and even from progressive 
        politicians, one of whose main agenda was a general reform of public health 
        policies. Wallace took an active role in the campaign, and in the present 
        work (as well as in the main ones that preceded it: <a href="S374-509.htm">S374</a> 
        and S536) pointed out that although the second half of the Nineteenth 
        Century had witnessed a decrease in the number of smallpox-caused deaths, 
        the number of epidemics had actually grown steadily. He claimed that while 
        it was possible to show that vaccination had effectively increased the 
        number of epidemics, there was no evidence that it had led to a decrease 
        in the death rate. Wallace denied, for example, the 1883 official figures 
        regarding the situation at the Metropolitan Hospital: according to these 
        statistics smallpox had killed 45% of the unvaccinated victims, and only 
        15% of the vaccinated. Wallace pointed out that the aged, weak children, 
        tramps, and criminals who had escaped the program were included among 
        the unvaccinated; thus this category included the weakest and most ill 
        individuals to begin with. Wallace also noted that many people, driven 
        by fear, had exhibited false documents claiming they were already vaccinated.</i></p>
      <p><i>Wallace's moral principles and liberal and socialist beliefs played 
        an important role in leading him to view mandatory vaccination as an unbearable 
        imposition on personal freedom and privacy. Meanwhile, his vision of <u>harmonia 
        naturae</u> (the world viewed as the tangible manifestation of an unbroken 
        and harmonious system) induced him to hypothesize a certain compatibility 
        and co-existence between man and microbe. On the one hand, and in accordance 
        with the law of survival of the fittest, germs/viruses have a role in 
        eliminating the weakest organisms (a notion similar to ideas held at that 
        time on the nature of human warfare). But in human society, Wallace maintained, 
        solidarity and civil progress are more important. Healthy living conditions 
        can be achieved by proper hygiene and a good diet. A man who is physically 
        and mentally healthy is potentially unassailable by diseases. The use 
        of chemicals in medicine could thus disrupt the delicate natural balance, 
        and have a negative rather than beneficial effect.</i></p>
      <p><i>Today it is easy to smile at those who in the decades around 1900 
        fought to abolish vaccination. But there was more to this reform-minded 
        civil protest than mere superstition, factiousness or obscurantism. Claiming 
        that vaccination was responsible for killing lives rather than saving 
        them was certainly hyperbole; nevertheless, it is sometimes true that 
        medical innovations can, if applied with excessive vigor, prove harmful. 
        Here, it should not be forgotten that the process of inactivation of the 
        vaccinal lymph was yet to be invented. Later on, smallpox was eradicated--by 
        using the same tool (i.e. vaccination), but through vaccine doses that 
        were much reduced and purified compared to those used during Wallace's 
        time, which are today known to cause serious side effects.</i></p>

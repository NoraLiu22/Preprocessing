<H2><font face="wingdings" size=6></font>Native American Baby Names: The Warning</h2>

On a weekly basis, we receive mail from some teenage girl (or occasionally boy) explaining that their parents gave them a Native American name and 
they now want to confirm the name's meaning or learn what tribe it comes from. The only problem is that the name in question is rarely Native American, 
and almost never has the meaning that they were told it did. Upon investigating this further, I found that there are dozens of "American Indian baby 
name list" sites on the Internet repeating the same list of 50-70 supposedly Native American girls and boys names... of which very few are genuine. 
No, Chenoa does not mean "white dove" in Cherokee, and Aiyana does not mean "blossom" or "eternal bloom." Kaya does not mean "little sister" 
in Hopi. Nadie does not mean "wise" in Algonquin. These and many other translations are flatly false and we have no idea where they came from.

<BR><BR>
Other names on these lists do come from Native American words, but are inaccurately translated. For example, Kasa is widely claimed to mean 
"dressed in furs" or "fur-clad" in Hopi. The Hopi word <I>kwasa</I> means a dress or skirt, which must be where that idea came from, but it 
has nothing to do with fur, and there must be dozens of dogs out there inadvertantly named "skirt" because of this mistranslation. 
Some names are mistakenly claimed to be Native American when in fact they come from Hebrew, Greek, or another non-Native American language. 
Others are unrecognizable and just plain untraceable, claimed to mean "power of the moon" or "angel of precious stone" in some generic 
"Native American" language. Think about it<B>:</b> if these were real Native American names, why would no one even have any idea 
which <B>language</B> they are supposed to be in? And then there are still other names that were invented by white writers of old Westerns, 
romance novels, fantasy adventure books or role-playing games about pseudo-Native American barbarians in alternate universes--yet 
somehow find their way onto these lists of American Indian baby names anyway. Believe me, you haven't seen disappointed until you've had 
to break the news to junior-high-school-age Katet and Svaha that their names come not from Native American tribal tradition but from 
books written by Stephen King and Charles de Lint.
<BR><BR>
So please, whatever you choose to name your new babies, <B>DON'T</b> just pick a name randomly off a list of "American Indian baby 
names" on the Internet. Otherwise, sixteen years from now, they're going to be the ones emailing me for the crushing news that their names 
come from Shadowrun, or were made up by unscrupulous people trying to sell more books. Due to the high degree of sloppy research 
and/or deliberate deception involved in the baby name industry, I can't recommend using any baby name book or website for finding 
Native American names for a child<B>;</B> your money would be much better spent on a decent dictionary of the Native American 
language spoken by your ancestors. If you're determined to sort through baby name books, though, here's a page of explanations about 
<a href="http://www.native-languages.org/wrongnames.htm">some of the most common incorrectly translated Indian baby names</a> 
we get email about, to help you separate some of the wheat from the chaff. If you've fallen in love with a Native American baby name 
that's not on that list and want to know if it has the meaning the Internet claims it does, feel free to 
<A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">contact us</A> and ask.
<BR><BR>
On a related topic, I should also note that there has been a recent trend towards giving white children the names of Indian tribes as first names 
(Dakota, Cheyenne, Chippewa, etc.) This isn't necessarily the best idea, for two reasons<B>:</b> first, some Native Americans find the 
practice culturally and religiously inappropriate. It's difficult to explain why to outsiders, but think about how acceptable Biblical names like 
Mary and Jacob are to most American Christians, yet how unacceptable baby names like Christ or God would be. Tribal names have 
special meaning in Indian culture, and using them as first names isn't considered respectful in some communities. 
Second, the names of Indian tribes tend to have meanings that aren't that appropriate for a child's name.
Dakota, for example, is a plural noun--it's akin to naming your son "Frenchmen." Chippewa literally 
means "puckered up" (a reference to the tribe's pucke<img src="singledot.png">red moccasin style.) 
Your child may not thank you for a name like this when he or she grows up any more than the people you're trying to honor will.

<H2><font face="wingdings" size=6></font>Native American Baby Names: The Explanation</h2>

So with those warnings duly in mind, how <U>can</U> you find a Native American name for your child, then?
<BR><BR>
Well, it really depends what kind of name you are looking for. If you want a <B>traditional Native American name</b>, you will need to 
speak to an elder or religious leader in the tribal community you are associated with. Every Native American tribe has slightly different 
naming practices. In many, a true name is not given until after a baby is born, not until the child reaches puberty in some cases. In 
other tribes babies must be given names from their parents' own family or clan. Traditional American Indian names are often spiritually 
divined, unique to each individual, and/or related to an accomplishment, rite of passage, dream, or life event. Obviously, this is not 
something you are going to be able to replicate online, in a baby book, or from strangers. There is no way to get a traditional Indian 
name other than from an older family member, tribal religious leader, or an elder who has met you and probably your child in person.
<BR><BR>
However, if you are looking for a modern American-style <B>baby name inspired by your Native American heritage</b>, you do have 
two simpler options available to you<B>:</b> 
<BR><BR>
1) Use a Native American variant of a Hebrew or Christian name, for example, Kateri (Catherine) or Atian (Stephen). This is the Native American
equivalent of Spanish names like Catalina (Catherine) and Esteban (Stephen).
<BR><BR>
2) Use or adapt a word from a Native American language. This is the Native American equivalent of Irish names like Colleen or 
Shannon (neither of which is traditional as a person's name, but they do come from Irish Gaelic words and are popular as first names
in the Irish community today.)
<BR><BR>
Native American-inspired names such as these are not <U>traditional</U> ones, nor will they be truly unique to your child 
(any more than Colleen or Catalina would be), but they may be interesting or attractive to you, and they may help your child 
make a pleasing connection with your heritage. And any time Native American languages get positive exposure in our culture, I consider 
that a good thing. So if you'd like to find your own Native American baby name, please browse through our free index of
<A href="http://www.native-languages.org/">Native American languages</A> to see if there are any words there that appeal to you, or buy a
<A href="http://www.native-languages.org/dictionary.htm">Native American dictionary</A> in a language of your choice.

<H2><font face="wingdings" size=6></font>Native American Baby Names: Suggestions</h2>

There is one other option<b>;</b> we can suggest some possible baby names for you ourselves. Our nonprofit linguistic organization currently 
runs a fundraiser in which we offer <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/names.htm">Native American names</a> for people's pets. 
We can use the same format to provide you with some ideas for Native American words to use as first names for a child. 
<B>Please understand that we delete all requests for spiritual or 'medicine' names.</B> The words we suggest are no different, spiritually 
speaking, than American Indian names you looked up in a language dictionary. If you are looking for an American Indian name with 
spiritual significance for yourself or for a child's naming ceremony, <U>please</u> talk to an elder in your community instead. 
No stranger can do this for you over the Internet. 
<BR><BR>
On the other hand, if you're looking for an original first or middle name for your new baby and would like to honor your Native American 
heritage by using or adapting a word from your ancestors' language, then please fill out the form below. If you prefer,

<h3>Program of Study</h3>




<p>The program in Religious Studies introduces students to the academic study of religion. Students in Religious Studies learn how to think, talk, and write about religion in a way that is well-informed, rigorously critical, and responsibly engaged. The study of religion investigates how human societies construct practices, seek meanings, and pose questions about their world. These investigations may be constructive, cultural, and/or historical. Since it touches all facets of human experience, the study of religion is a crucial conversation partner with other fields of study and draws on the entire range of humanistic and social scientific disciplines. Students in the program can explore numerous religious traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Daoism, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, and Shinto are exposed to the sources, problems, methods, and methodologies of our diverse areas of study. The interests of our students may be descriptive, explanatory, and/or normative.</p>




<a name="programrequirements"></a>
<h3>Program Requirements</h3>




<p>Religious Studies majors have the option of pursuing one of two tracks: the Regular Track or the Research Track. Students in the Regular Track must take eleven courses for the major, including <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2010100" title="RLST 10100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 10100');">RLST 10100</a> Introduction to Religious Studies</span> and at least one introductory-level (&quot;Gateway&quot;) course. There is no order in which these courses need to be taken. Students in the Research Track will also complete these requirements; in addition, they will complete a BA thesis during two BA seminars: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2029800" title="RLST 29800" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 29800');">RLST 29800</a> BA Research Seminar I</span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2029900" title="RLST 29900" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 29900');">RLST 29900</a> BA Research Seminar II</span>. This BA thesis is typically completed in a student's fourth year. Students who wish to pursue the Research Track must officially declare their intention to do so with the Director of Undergraduate Studies by the end of Spring Quarter during their third year. Only students in the Research Track are eligible for departmental honors. Students double majoring may submit one research paper for both majors by submitting the proper form to the Director of Undergraduates Studies (see below). If a student is double majoring and is completing comparable BA paper seminars in another department, they may not need to take the RLST BA Paper Seminars, at the discretion of the Director of Undergraduate Studies.</p>





<p>Students with permission to enroll in graduate Divinity School courses may count them toward the major. The course codes for graduate Divinity School courses are as follows: AASR, BIBL, DVPR, HCHR, HIJD, HREL, ISLM, RAME, RELP, RETH, RLVC, and THEO. Students who wish to receive credit in the major for non-departmental courses must submit a petition to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Such requests are decided on a case-by-case basis. For courses taken at an institution other than the University of Chicago (or an institution at which a student is enrolled as part of a study abroad program that is sponsored by the University of Chicago), students must also receive approval for transfer credit from the Office of the Dean of Students. For more information, see <a href="/thecollege/transfercredit/">Transfer Credit</a>.</p>




<h4>Introductory Course Requirement</h4>




<p>Students in Religious Studies are required to take an introductory-level (&quot;Gateway&quot;) course. It need not precede other course work in the major, but students are advised to have completed it by the end of their second year. Gateway courses include (but are not limited to) <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2011004" title="RLST 11004" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 11004');">RLST 11004</a> Introduction to the Hebrew Bible</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2012000" title="RLST 12000" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 12000');">RLST 12000</a> Introduction to the New Testament: Texts and Contexts of Interpretation</span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2011030" title="RLST 11030" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 11030');">RLST 11030</a> Introduction to the Qur'an</span>. An updated list of the Gateway courses offered each year may be found on the program's website. Students who completed all three quarters of the general education sequence <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOSC%2017100-17200-17300" title="SOSC 17100-17200-17300" class="bubblelink seq3code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOSC 17100-17200-17300');">SOSC 17100-17200-17300</a> Religion: Cosmos, Conscience, and Community I-II-III</span> do not need to complete the Gateway requirement and can instead take an RLST course of their choice.</p>





<p>Students who first enrolled at the University of Chicago in or after 2022 are required to take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2010100" title="RLST 10100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 10100');">RLST 10100</a> Introduction to Religious Studies</span>. Any substitution for RLST 10100 must have the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies.</p>





<h4>Course Distribution</h4>




<p>Religion is expressed in many forms throughout the world's cultures, and the academic study of religion therefore requires multiple perspectives on its subject. Students of religion should have some knowledge of the historical development of specific religious traditions, understand and critically engage the ethical and intellectual teachings of various religions, and begin to make some comparative appraisals of the roles that religions play in different cultures and historical periods. To introduce students to these multiple perspectives on religion and to provide a sense of the field as a whole, students are required to take at least one course in two of the following areas. To identify the areas, refer to the RLST number range (see below).</p>




<p>A. Historical Studies in Religious Traditions: courses that explore the development of particular religious traditions, including their social practices, rituals, scriptures, and beliefs in historical context (RLST 11000 through 15000, 20000 through 22900).</p>




<p>B. Constructive Studies in Religion: courses that investigate constructive or normative questions about the nature and conduct of human life that are raised by religious traditions, including work in philosophy of religion, ethics, and theology (RLST 23000 through 25900).</p>




<p>C. Cultural Studies in Religion: courses that introduce issues in the social and cultural contingencies of religious thought and practice by emphasizing sociological, anthropological, and literary-critical perspectives on religion, and by raising comparative questions about differing religious and cultural traditions (RLST 26000 through 29500).</p>




<h4>Senior Seminar and BA Paper</h4>




<p>The two-quarter senior sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2029800" title="RLST 29800" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 29800');">RLST 29800</a> BA Research Seminar I</span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2029900" title="RLST 29900" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 29900');">RLST 29900</a> BA Research Seminar II</span>) will assist students in the Research Track with the preparation of the required BA paper. During May of their third year, students will work with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to choose a faculty adviser and a topic for research, and to plan a course of study for the following year. To begin the BA paper, a student must complete the BA Project Proposal Form and have it signed by the Director of Undergraduate Studies, typically by the end of the Spring Quarter of their third year.</p>





<p>In their fourth year, students in the Research Track will take part in the BA paper seminar convened by a preceptor during the Autumn and Winter Quarters. This seminar will allow students to prepare their bibliographies, hone their writing, and present their research. Students will register for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2029800" title="RLST 29800" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 29800');">RLST 29800</a> BA Research Seminar I</span> in the Autumn Quarter and for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2029900" title="RLST 29900" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 29900');">RLST 29900</a> BA Research Seminar II</span> in the Winter Quarter. The BA paper will be due the second week of Spring Quarter. The length is typically between thirty and forty pages, with the upward limit being firm.</p>





<p>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with the consent of the other program. The student will only have to take the BA paper seminars for one of the two majors. Approval from both departments is required. Students should consult with the departments by the earliest BA paper proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year if neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both departments, is available from the College Academic Advising Office. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation.</p>




<a name="grading"></a>
<h3>Grading</h3>




<p>Religious Studies majors must receive quality grades in all courses in the major. With consent of instructor, nonmajors may take Religious Studies courses for P/F grading. Faculty will determine the criteria that constitute a Pass.</p>




<a name="honors"></a>
<h3>Honors</h3>




<p>Honors are awarded by the Divinity School's Committee on Undergraduate Studies. Students who write senior papers deemed exceptional by their faculty advisers will be eligible for consideration for graduation with honors. Only students in the Research Track are eligible for honors. To be considered for honors, students in the Research Track must also have a 3.5 GPA or higher in the major and a 3.25 GPA or higher overall. Please see the program's website for a full list of honors and awards.</p>

<h3>Minor Program in Religious Studies</h3>




<p>The minor in Religious Studies requires a total of six courses. For students who first enrolled at the University of Chicago in or after 2022, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RLST%2010100" title="RLST 10100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RLST 10100');">RLST 10100</a> Introduction to Religious Studies</span> is required of all minors, unless the Director of Undergraduate Studies approves a substitution for this course.</p>





<p>The remaining five courses should be chosen to reflect a broad understanding of the academic study of religion. Of these five, students must take at least one course in two of our three areas of study [Historical Studies (A), Constructive Studies (B), and Cultural Studies (C)]. Courses in the minor may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, and may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. As with the major, students with permission to enroll in graduate Divinity School courses may count these toward the minor.</p>




<p>The student must complete a substantial (at least 10–15 pages) paper or project. It is expected that this paper will normally be written as part of the student's course work for the minor. This work should engage critically with primary source materials and exemplify methodological sophistication in the study of religion, and should earn a grade no lower than B–. Students should send the completed paper to the Director of Undergraduate Studies for fulfillment of this requirement.</p>




<p>Students who elect the minor program in Religious Studies must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to declare their intention to complete the minor. <a href="https://humanities-web.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/college-prod/s3fs-public/documents/Consent_Minor_Program.pdf">Consent to Complete a Minor Program</a> forms are available online or from the student’s College adviser.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>RLST 10100.  Introduction to Religious Studies.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
What is religion? Is it the source of truth? Is it fiction? Believe it or not, religion affects what we think, what we do, and how we situate ourselves and others. In this introductory course, we will examine the intertwined histories of the concept of religion and the academic study of religion. We will familiarize ourselves with classical and contemporary theorists of religion and consider the methods, motivations, and historical contexts that have made their theories of religion possible. Along the way, we will survey key concepts such as myth and ritual and relate them to a broader set of problems concerning places, bodies, and politics. Throughout the course, we will apply what we learn about religion to issues within and outside the field of Religious Studies and consider the importance of the study of religion both within and beyond the university. There are no prerequisites for this course. All students are welcome.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This class introduces students to the texts that make up the New Testament through close readings of representative examples. Through course lectures and readings, students will gain familiarity with the historical, geographical, social, religious, cultural, and political contexts of New Testament literature and the events they narrate. We will also learn about the central literary genres found within the collection of texts that came to form the canonical New Testament, including &quot;gospels,&quot; &quot;acts,&quot; &quot;letters,&quot; and &quot;apocalypses&quot;), and we will examine how awareness of genre conventions enhances our reading of these works. Students will also learn about the distinctive theological and cultural viewpoints contained within various New Testament texts. As we learn about the history of biblical scholarship, especially the goals and methods of biblical interpretation, we will practice refining our questions. Assignments and discussion will allow students to develop their skills as attuned readers of both ancient texts as well as modern biblical scholarship. PQ: No prior knowledge of biblical literature, the ancient world, or Christianity is expected. The only expectation is commitment to engaged discussion about the challenges of interpretation with classmates holding various viewpoints.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>RLST 20124.  The Bible Throughout History: From the Dead Sea Scrolls to King James.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
While the collection of ancient texts found in modern Bibles appears fixed and is read by many people as a source of edification or theological insight, it has not always been this way. Though absent from most Bibles, there is an entire body of literature commonly known as &quot;rewritten bible&quot;: early translations, retellings, or entirely new stories with familiar names and faces that update, retcon, or subvert their &quot;biblical&quot; sources. How might we understand these ancient forms of fan fiction? The class will introduce this corpus (including some of the Dead Sea Scrolls) and its sources, production, and historical contexts. We will confront significant problems in understanding religious texts: how is it that some texts become authoritative while other very similar texts do not? Who gets to retell foundational religious narratives, and within what social or political constraints? What does it mean to relate to sacred texts as artistic prompts or imperfect points of departure? Can a biblical text be rewritten for an entirely different religious tradition? We will consider similar questions for contemporary religious practice, asking: how did rewriting the Bible get started, and has it stopped?</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course examines the complex issues surrounding the body, disability, and medical care in antiquity. It will be guided by a variety of questions, such as what was the root cause of bodily infirmity and disease in antiquity? How did cultural views of sex, gender, and race influence perceptions of the body and what it meant to be able bodied? Such questions are significant when considering what kind of access to healthcare marginalized groups had. In order to explore these questions, we will examine ancient Mediterranean views of medical care through material remains (e.g., magical amulets and healing shrines) and textual evidence (e.g., Galen and Hippocrates). After considering this wider cultural context, we will examine treatments in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and early Christianity. We will also explore how Christian concepts of medical care evolved in light of accounts of Jesus as a divine healer. In addition to this ancient evidence, we will engage with modern disability studies and sociological analyses to better orient our readings. At the end of the course, students will be better acquainted with the complex relationship between religion and medicine and how that affects modern healthcare decisions.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course will examine some of the ancient Greek roots of early Christianity. We will focus on affinities between Christianity and the classical tradition as well as ways in which the Christian faith may be considered radically different from it. Some of the more important issues that we will analyze are: &quot;The spell of Homer.&quot; How the Homeric poems exerted immeasurable influence on the religious attitudes and practices of the Greeks. The theme of creation in Greek and Roman authors such as Hesiod and Ovid. The Orphic account of human origins. The early Christian theme of Christ as Creator/Savior. Greek, specifically Homeric conceptions of the afterlife. The response to the Homeric orientation in the form of the great mystery cults of Demeter, Dionysus, and Orpheus. The views of the philosophers (esp. Plato) of the immortality of the soul compared with the New Testament conception of resurrection of the body. Ancient Greek conceptions of sacrifice and the crucifixion of Christ as archetypal sacrifice. The attempted synthesis of Jewish and Greek philosophic thought by Philo of Alexandria and its importance for early Christianity.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The Church Councils of late antiquity (fourth-seventh centuries) were huge conferences of bishops, priests, monks, secular officials, and emperors, who met to decide on the rules that would govern the Church and the doctrines that all Christians had to believe. They combined philosophical debate, criminal trials, committee meetings, and Senate procedure. Some were rowdy and acrimonious, while others were meticulously organized in advance, usually by the court. Some remain obscure, while others are the most thoroughly documented events in all ancient history and reveal in detail how the later Roman government operated. In this course we will read, in Greek, a number of fascinating narratives and official acts stemming from the most important Councils, including Nicaea I (325), Ephesos I (431), and Chalcedon (451). We will also discuss the Councils from a historical perspective to understand the complex negotiations that gave rise to Christian doctrine and canon law.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The makers of Middle Eastern Christianities were both saints and sinners. Holy men and women, monks, and sometimes bishops withdrew from what they often called &quot;the world&quot; with the intention of reshaping society through prayer, asceticism, and writing; some also intervened directly in social, political, and economic relations. The work of these saints depended on the cooperation of  aristocrats, merchants, and rulers who established enduring worldly institutions.

In the early second century there were bitter battles over the legacy of Paul and his preserved letters in terms of gender, sexuality, family life, asceticism, church administration, and theological vision. We can see these well by reading the narrative text The Acts of Paul and Thecla alongside the &quot;Pastoral Epistles&quot; (1 and 2 Timothy, Titus), the former championing a female, cross-dressing ascetic Christ-missionary and the latter, in pseudepigraphical epistolary texts written in the dead Paul's name, insisting on patriarchal family life and women's adherence to traditional roles. In this course we shall read both sets of texts carefully in Greek, noting points of similarity and contestation, and test various models of how these sources-each of which seeks to &quot;fix&quot; the Pauline legacy in its own way-are related to one another. Time allowing, we shall also look at the later reception of the cult of Saint Thecla and late antique interpretations of &quot;the apostle,&quot; Paul, on these issues of sexuality and gender roles, and their perduring influence in contemporary debates.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course is part of a two-sequence series, to be followed by a course on Japanese Zen Buddhism taught by Professor Stephan Licha in Winter 2025.  &quot;Chan&quot; is a partial Chinese transliteration of the Sanskrit word &quot;Dhyana,&quot; meaning meditation practice; the same Chinese character is pronounced &quot;Zen&quot; in Japanese.  This course will consist of the close reading (in English translation) and discussion of both the Indian Buddhist scriptures and indigenous Chinese sources that form the core of the tradition spanning Chan and Zen, with a few secondary descriptions of Chan institutions and cultural influences.  Our focus will be on the development of ideas concerning the nature of sentience and the implications this has for understanding the existential predicament of sentient beings, touching on central themes of dependent co-arising, non-self, Emptiness, consciousness-only, Buddha-nature and original enlightenment, and the methods of realization (doctrinal, non-doctrinal, and indeed anti-doctrinal) proposed to redress this existential predicament at each stage of Chan history. This will be done both with an eye to the historical continuity of these sometimes seemingly contradictory forms thought and practice, and also to extract from them whatever transhistorical philosophical and spiritual valences we care to derive from the texts.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The Reformation in Britain is one of the most contested areas in early modern history. Was it mostly a political event, triggered by Henry VIII's desire for a divorce? Was it an organic movement from the ground up, inspired by the enthusiasm of ordinary believers in the same way as many reform movements in continental Europe? Did it have a distinctive theology of its own: can we call this 'Anglicanism'? Should we be studying the 'British Reformation' on its own terms at all, or should it be viewed simply as an offshoot of the continental European Reformations? And did the puritans really want to cancel Christmas? This course will give students a thorough grounding in the Reformation in Britain c.1450-1660, paying especial attention to the complex historiographical issues that still plague the topic to this day. Students will have the opportunity to study a range of key primary texts from the era, from John Foxe's Book of Martyrs to the letters of Queen Elizabeth I, as well as to examine the modern-day legacies of English reform.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

As well as covering the key theological ideas of famous Protestant reformers (Luther; Zwingli; Calvin), it will give ample space to the impact that these religious revolutions had on contemporary society, including attitudes to gender, politics, economics, and visual/material culture. It will cover the reformations and renewals undergone by Catholicism in the same period, and discuss the key arguments, questions, and concerns which have preoccupied historians of the Reformation since the nineteenth century. Students will have the opportunity to read and engage with famous texts from the period (for instance Erasmus's On Free Will; Luther's 95 Theses; Calvin's Institutes) as well as lesser-known but still influential works (e.g. the poetry of the female Italian humanist Olympia Fulvia Morata and the writings of early Jesuit missionaries to China and Japan), in addition to historically significant documents (such as contemporary witchcraft confessions and extracts from Reformation demonologies). Finally, there will be time devoted to unpacking the complex legacies of the Reformation and the 'unintended consequences' attributed to it, focusing especially on the afterlives of Max Weber's analyses.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

In European thought, the relationship between technê (craft or art) and epistêmê (knowledge) has long been a fraught one. Crucially, the practical knowledge associated with skill or art in making is often subordinated to more abstract forms of knowledge production such as mathematics or philosophy itself; and in the sphere of art, poets and critics often make a distinction between 'mere' technique and higher or unmediated forms of artistic expression. In this course, we will examine philosophical and artistic assumptions and arguments about technê, technics, and technique by staging a broad conversation between poets and philosophers; and we will consider recent discussions of technê and the impact that modern scientific technology has on the nature of thinking and artistic making. Readings will be drawn from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Heidegger, and from poetic works ranging from ancient epics to Wallace Stevens and beyond.

Contemporary ideas about Human Rights, the relation of moral norms and the good life, the character of human freedom, conceptions of human evil, and the very definition of morality and ethics have been decisively shaped by the work of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). This course is the examination of one of Immanuel Kant's magisterial works in moral philosophy, The Critique of Practical Reason. The course is a careful reading of Kant's text in order to grasp the argument and to assess its significance for current work in Ethics. The course ends with one of Kant's famous political essays, &quot;On Perpetual Peace.&quot; Engaging Kant's work will enable student to engage a wide range of thinkers from the 19th to the 21st centuries who accept, modify, and reject his work. In this way, the course is crucial for further work in philosophical and religious ethics.

How might religions activate the abolitionist imagination? 
The contemporary abolition movement is not just about dismantling prisons or the police. It is about imagining alternatives to the conditions that make prisons and the police possible-and experimenting with new modes of living together that replace punishment with care. Many abolitionist thinkers thus see abolition as a sacred force interrupting the normalized brutalities of everyday life.
This course focuses on Jewish, Christian, and Islamic theologies that interrogate incarceration, capitalism, and the settler colonial state. We will analyze the possibilities and limits of these theologies as revolutionary resources.

Humanity's immense impact on Earth's systems has led some scientists to claim that we have entered a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. Humans' influence on Earth's landscape, climate system, and biodiversity inspires many to ask, in turn, What should be done about humankind's planetary powers? Some scholars and religious leaders claim that people should take responsibility and influence Earth's systems for good ends, while others argue that we should radically scale down such power. Still others suggest that the Anthropocene requires us to entirely revise our ideas of power and responsibility and even develop new religious sensibilities. Through discussions and focused writing assignments, students in this class will explore and evaluate these and additional responses to the Anthropocene, paying specific attention to how Anthropocene ethical thought wrestles with the place of religion on a changing planet. The course culminates in an extended examination of how Anthropocene discourse conceals racial antagonisms and contemporary decolonial struggles.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

From the horrors of the Shoah to violence suffered by individuals, the question of the origin, meaning, and reality of evil done by humans has vexed thinkers throughout the ages. This seminar is an inquiry into the problem of evil on three registers of reflection: myth, symbol, and reality. We will be exploring important philosophical, Jewish, and Christian texts. These include Martin Buber, Good and Evil, Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem, Immanuel Kant, Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone, Paul Ricoeur, The Symbolism of Evil, Edward Farley, Good and Evil, Hans Jonas, Mortality and Morality and Claudia Card, The Atrocity Paradigm. There will also be a viewing of the movie Seven (1995) directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker.

Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, &quot;I would only believe in a god that knows how to dance.&quot; This course will use Nietzsche's comment as a springboard for critical philosophical exploration of embodied theories of knowledge, reality, and the divine. Along the way, we will leverage the image of a 'dancing god' to interrogate philosophical and religious dichotomies in both Western and Eastern traditions (e.g., between sacred/profane, theory/praxis, transcendence/immanence, masculine/feminine). Some traditions have used the metaphor of dance to theorize about a god of dynamic becoming vs. a &quot;wallflower&quot; god of static being. Contemporary cognitive scientists, inspired by Buddhist philosophy, speculate that selfhood might resemble something like an embodied form of &quot;dance,&quot; rather than a substantial mode of existence. How, then, can the notion of a &quot;dancing god&quot; challenge orthodox, atemporal, or disembodied conceptions of God, reality, and human experience? In what ways does a practical 'knowing how' differ from a purely theoretical 'knowing that'-and how does this impact the meaning and purpose of religious life? Readings will include Nietzsche, Durkheim, William James, Charles Hartshorne, Michael Polanyi, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others; no prior experience with the philosophy of religion is required.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

You don't really understand an antagonist,&quot; screenwriter John Rogers writes, &quot;until you understand why he's a protagonist in his own version of the world.&quot; This principle holds true of movie villains, but also raises important questions about disagreement, dehumanization, and the diabolical in the real world.

Some scholars working in the study of gender and sexuality view religion as the conservative enemy of progress, irreconcilably antagonistic to the flourishing of any non-normative gender or sexuality. At the same time, some religious practitioners view feminism as a Western or liberal invention, an imposition that attempts to manage the lives of religious subjects. Still others find feminism and religious commitment mutually reinforcing, and have developed feminist, womanist, and queer rituals and theologies. This course examines contemporary texts, ethnographies, memoirs, and films that grapple with these tensions. In so doing, the course also helps students develop familiarity with foundational categories both in religious studies and in the study of gender and sexuality. Further questions to be explored include: Does religion facilitate or oppose the flourishing of women, queers, and people of color? Is religion a guardian of tradition that resists politically progressive aims, or do religions offer resources for interrogating secular liberalism? The course primarily considers Islamic, Christian, and Jewish traditions. Prior coursework in religious studies or gender and sexuality studies is helpful but not necessary.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>RLST 24102.  Justice in an Unjust World: Theories of Justice.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
Justice as a possibility, an ideal, and as a telos is fundamental to theological and philosophical systems of ethics.  Yet, each theory was formulated within and against a deeply unjust world.   Every theory of justice implies an anthropology and an ontology, and each asks the question:  Why isn't life fair?   How can we can we create a just society against a world that is so obviously unjust?   Each theory then proposes a just solution and every theory implies a set of practices that can be interrogated.  As our contemporary society becomes more sharply divided, the issues of distribution, obligation, entitlement, fair exchanges of social goods and labor, and the fair sharing of social burdens becomes more important and demanding of more inquiry.    This seminar will interrogate several theories of justice, beginning in classic Hellenistic texts and moving forward to the animating theories of the classic liberal tradition:  libertarianism, utilitarianism, social contract theory, and Marxism.  We will then turn to other sources of justice theory such as Catholic liberation theology, capacity theory, and Jewish justice theory.  We will also use our seminar to explore contemporary cases in law, medicine, science and policy that raise issues of justice and injustice.  While the seminar will focus on distributive practices, we will also explore how these practices structure our systems of retributive and restorative justice.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Drawing on Buddhist meditation literature from various traditions, historical periods, and literary genre, in this seminar we will take up a twofold question: First, how has the encounter with Buddhist techniques of cultivation shaped the modern understanding of &quot;meditation&quot;, and second, up to which extend, and at what cost, has this very modern understanding conversely conditioned us to see Buddhism as a &quot;meditative religion&quot; par excellence?</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Religion played a crucial, but often overlooked, role in the development of post-World War II conceptions of human rights, providing principles and ideas that continue to influence contemporary human rights debates in the fields of law, public policy, and international relations. This no-prior-knowledge-necessary course explores the complex, sometimes fraught, relationship between religion and human rights from World War II to the present. We will begin by juxtaposing the role religious ideas played in the drafting of core post-war human rights documents (e.g. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, etc.) with the decision by drafters to omit direct references to the divine or the beliefs of specific religious communities. Using case study analysis and close reading of primary religious texts, scholarly commentary, and historical accounts, we will examine the ways in which individuals and groups from multiple religious (and non-religious) traditions both apply and push back against existing human rights norms. Throughout the course we will discuss the role religion might play in debates surrounding emerging, but still contentious, conceptions of human rights. This includes: universal healthcare, LGBTQIA+ rights,  ever more complex manifestations of religious freedom, as well as whether human rights as conceived of in the mid-20th Century can be reconciled with decolonial and post-colonial perspectives.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Augustine's City of God is a major work of history, politics, and religion. Written after Rome was sacked by the Visigoths in 410, the work begins an apology (justification) of the Empire's turn to Christianity and expands to offer a sweeping and deeply theological account of human history and society in terms of earth-bound versus heaven-centered community. Augustine's citizenship and politics entails living out membership in either fellowship while commingled on earth with the other. Augustine analyzes Roman history and politics as well as the new religion first encouraged and eventually imposed in the wake of Constantine's conversion.
We shall read the entire work in translation, attending to historical observations, political stances, and religious views. Augustine made arguments of his own but saved huge swaths of Varro and other otherwise lost sources to fashion his historical critique of Rome, social analysis, and many ultimately fresh views on matters like human sexuality in paradise and in heaven.

People across the political spectrum continue to cite the Bible to justify their viewpoints. Black Lives Matter protestors carried signs citing scriptural support for the rights of African Americans to life and justice, while some of those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6th first marched around their state capitols in recreation of biblical Israel's circling of the doomed city Jericho. How can the same book serve the political ends of such ideologically distinct movements? 
In this course, we will explore the variety of ways in which the Bible, especially the Christian New Testament, informs contemporary political discourse. We will discuss what the Bible is and where it comes from, and how an interpreter's social location and culturally and historical-bound assumptions shape their interpretation. We will build upon this foundation by examining several contentious political issues in which the Bible is commonly invoked, including abortion, sexuality, immigration, and gun rights. We will analyze the key passages used by supporters of various policy positions to support their claims, situating these texts in their original contexts and highlighting the historical distance that problematizes their use today.

In this course, we will examine different conceptions of memory offered by religious thinkers, philosophers, and historians. We will then compare theories that articulate the basis for memorial norms, duties, and responsibilities. To conclude the course, we will use the theories canvassed in the first two parts to evaluate two contemporary memory issues: the debate over &quot;working-off-the-past&quot; (Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung) in relation to crimes perpetrated by Nazi Germany, and the legacy of the Civil War in the United States.

This course approaches bodies as points of insight into governance, the varied experiences of being governed, and efforts to evade and reconfigure institutional expressions of authority. First, we will examine bodies as targets of governance, objects to be reformed, regulated, contained, disciplined, educated, incarcerated, treated, trained, and &quot;cared&quot; for. Next, we will consider how bodies accrue power as sites of resistance, refusal, and critique. Certain bodies in certain places elicit discomfort, unsettling familiar divisions such as of private and public space, of developed and backward, of religious and secular, of reason and madness, of citizenship and (often racialized) non-citizenship. Finally, we will ask how bodies and sensory practices figure in ethical projects of crafting exemplary kinds of subjectivity or collectivity. In this way, the course will introduce students to anthropological approaches to embodiment as well as related questions of bio-politics, gender and race, political subjectivity, care and self-making, post/colonialism, sensory politics and the aesthetic.

In this course we analyze the complex concept of demonology according to early modern European culture from a theological, historical, philosophical, and literary point of view. The term 'demon' in the Renaissance encompasses a vast variety of meanings. Demons are hybrids. They are both the Christian devils, but also synonyms for classical deities, and Neo-platonic spiritual beings. As far as Christian theology is concerned, we read selections from Augustine's and Thomas Aquinas's treatises, some complex exorcisms written in Italy, and a recent translation of the infamous &quot;Malleus maleficarum,&quot; the most important treatise on witch-hunt. We pay close attention to the historical evolution of the so-called witch-craze in Europe through a selection of the best secondary literature on this subject, with special emphasis on Michel de Certeau's &quot;The Possession at Loudun.&quot; We also study how major Italian and Spanish women mystics, such as Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi and Teresa of Avila, approach the issue of demonic temptation and possession. As far as Renaissance Neoplatonic philosophy is concerned, we read selections from Marsilio Ficino's &quot;Platonic Theology&quot; and Girolamo Cardano's mesmerizing autobiography.

The concept of tradition often takes a back seat to modernity but what does it mean to be part of a tradition in the modern world? How does tradition challenge received views and stimulate creativity, against the modern view of tradition as the &quot;dead hand of the past&quot;? How have the concept; ideology; and cultural role of tradition changed in Jewish culture since the Enlightenment? This course explores those questions in three bodies of work: (1) late 18th- to mid-20th-century German-Jewish historians, critics, &amp; theologians; (2) modern Hebrew &amp; Yiddish writers; and (3) their shared biblical, rabbinic, and mystical inspirations. Through close readings of these writers' reflections on their own literary traditions, tradition emerges as both a resource and a problem for Jewish cultural creativity; one that calls for its own theoretical vocabulary and can be set in dialogue with the modern evolution of other traditional cultures.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

We analyze primary sources, such as the various Panther Parties' publications, their mainstream press coverage, and their pop cultural representations, like Ta-Nehisi Coates' Black Panther graphic novel and the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. In this course, students learn the global Black Panther Parties' roles in reshaping worldwide conceptions of race, caste, and religion through their encounters with the Nation of Islam, Hindu Nationalism, Zionism, and Indigenous rights. No prior knowledge or coursework is required.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

An introduction to the legal genres of classical rabbinic Judaism by applying the standard tools of source-, form-, redaction-, and literary criticism. Having established a working vocabulary, a map of the sources, and some facility with the tools, we will proceed to complicate the boundaries between law and aggadah (non-legal tradition) in its various forms (aphorism, parable, narrative cycle, case-law, ethical instruction, and more.) Having appreciated how law and aggadah interact in rabbinic literature to produce meaning, we will work on contextualizing their dialectic in light of multiple branches of a specific theory of meaning, culture, with a special focus on interpretive/symbolic anthropology.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course explores the genre of the strange, weird, bizarre and wonderous in literary works from around the world and across various time periods. In contrast to the voyeuristic and expected othering of the 'exotic', the course interrogates the strange as an aesthetic mode that estranges the reader and disturbs and upends our familiar and predictable worlds. Theorists have explored art's ability to unsettle our automatized perception, interrogating our relationship to reality, the way we know things, and the basis on which we make assumptions. This course will trace how specific literary forms (like magical-realism, fantasy, sci-fi, miracle literature, comedy/dark comedy, and even scripture) evoke wonder and a sense of the strange. We will explore how these genres mystify and make strange things like the individual, society, modernity, the nation-state, the secular, economy, and more to unearth the myth-making inherent in processes of world-building, as well as in narrative. We will see ghosts in court, hallucinating nation-states, dead narrators, animated-inanimate objects as we move into the world of dreams, madness, and the supernatural in literary works from Iceland, Iran, Palestine, Japan, Egypt and more.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Over the last several decades, reality television has become a central ingredient in media diets all across the world. One can practically trace a line from early hits like Survivor and Big Brother, which were quickly formatted for global circulation, to the recent viral success of Squid Game, a fictionalized account of a death-game tournament that spawned its own reality show. Why do audiences everywhere find reality TV so entertaining? What moral lessons do viewers take away from these shows? And what might scholars learn by taking this popular aesthetic form, in all its cultural variation, seriously? This course brings together media studies, aesthetic criticism, area studies, and the sociology of religion to try to answer some of these questions. The course will help students to think about the moral and spiritual beliefs embedded in popular cultural forms, but also to understand how these forms are now circulated and consumed in our contemporary media environment and what they tell us about late-stage global capitalism. Course readings will introduce students to scholarship in television studies, aesthetic criticism, religious studies, and cultural studies, providing them with the necessary foundations to analyze reality TV from multiple disciplinary perspectives. We will also screen examples of reality TV and its offshoots, with a specific focus on East Asian shows and the competition or elimination format.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

And now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper,&quot; writes Mary Shelley of Frankenstein. In framing her 1818 novel as itself a monster with agency, she raises questions about why and how we continue to create and regard our creations as monstrous. Why has the creation of artificial life fascinated us from ancient times to modern A.I.? How do we recognize and identify monsters, and what role do we have in their creation? Are creators responsible for their creations, or alienated from them? This class combines close reading of Frankenstein with religious and scientific texts on monsters, the creation of artificial life, and our moral responsibilities to our creations. We will discuss what narratives about the monstrous tell us about our values, how the &quot;human&quot; is contrasted with its opposites, and why the story of Frankenstein-as well as its predecessors and imitators-remains so hauntingly compelling.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Whether it's white Christian nationalism, prayer in schools, debates over gay marriage, the Movement for Black Lives, Evangelical support for Donald Trump, activism by the Religious Left, or the role of Islam in post-9/11 America, the intersection between religion and politics in the United States is complex, puzzling, and important. What is the relationship between religion and politics and what should the relationship between them be? How does religion help us make sense of politics? How does politics help us make sense of religion? In this course, we will draw on history, social science, philosophy, theology, and ethics in order to explore these questions. First, we'll consider the history of religion and politics in the United States, with readings including Locke and Jefferson on the separation of church and state, Danielle Allen and Tracy Smith on the Declaration of Independence, and Robert Bellah and Frederick Douglass on American civil religion. Then, we'll consider the ways Americans use religious ideas to inform their politics, from Jerry Falwell's arguments about the Moral Majority to Martin Luther King, Jr., James Baldwin, and Robert P.

Defining ethnography broadly as curiosity about human difference, this course engages close readings in a vast gallery of ethnographic portraits both of and by Jews, from the Bible to the early modern period. Together, we will construct a history of this tradition by tracing patterns in how Jews are represented and how they represent themselves, as well as their own Others, in dialogue with those cultures. While anthropologists and literary theorists will help us to appreciate the diversity and fluidity of Jewish (auto-)ethnography, these thinkers will also turn our critical gaze on Greek, Roman, and European Christian images of Jews and Judaism. This history is not simply a case-study in an overlooked ethnographic tradition but an archive where influential and often oppressive &quot;Western&quot; ways of thinking about human difference have been spawned, cross-fertilized, resisted, and transformed.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The term pilgrimage is usually associated with journeys to ancient religious sites such as the Vatican or Mecca. But why do superfans who travel to Disney World often describe this in terms of a pilgrimage? Why is it that when anime fans visit real-life sites from their favorite shows, this is frequently called a &quot;journey to sacred sites&quot; (seiichi junrei)? In this course we will discuss these and other questions about pilgrimage in its religious and secular forms. We will consider examples such as the Islamic Hajj, the Crusades, and a 750-mile Buddhist pilgrimage in Japan, alongside journeys to Platform 9¾ at King's Cross, Elvis's Graceland, and the sets of Hobbiton. After first exploring theories of travel, tourism, and pilgrimage through a global array of examples, the second half of the course consists of a deep dive into connections between anime tourism, religious travel in Japan, and the worldwide boom of Japanese pop culture.

Jewish thought has often been a powerful source for critiquing the Christian West and the exclusionary paradigms of nation, citizen, religion, race, and belonging. Yet how have Jewish thinkers-and thinking about Jews-intersected with other minority and racialized communities? And how have these discourses evolved in the aftermath of the Holocaust and the rise of Zionism and the State of Israel? Together we will examine central categories of Jewish thought and history such as exile, diaspora, race, nation, and alterity and place them in conversation with similar reflections emerging out of the histories of colonialism and postcolonialism. We will also explore the contemporary politics of Jewish thought, anti-Semitism, and anti-Zionism and the ways that perception of &quot;the Jew&quot; has changed in the postwar period from being a figure of difference to included within a purported &quot;Judeo-Christian civilization.&quot; Finally, we will explore the emerging links between Postcolonial and Jewish Studies and the possibilities enabled by thinking about these discourses in relation to one another.

Science fiction has enjoyed an extraordinary and still growing resurgence in popularity over the last two decades - through literature, film, video games, and even universities, where it is the subject of ever more courses being taught. Why has science fiction become so popular? Does it express the anxieties of a way of life that can't be sustained, is in decline, and might soon end, in the face of intractable war, lurching financial crises, recurrent pandemics and unchecked climate change? Does it speak to the senses of radical hope and irreparable despair about the future that seem to characterize our time? If so, then science fiction today is grappling with traditionally theological themes: fate and finitude, immortality and the nature of divinity, the place of the human within a cosmic scale, and the possibilities for redemption and messianic rupture. This course will explore these themes by pairing sci-fi literature and film with readings in philosophy and social theory. Throughout, we will ask how science fiction's propensity toward the theological allows it to grapple with the unique forms of hope and despair in our time, and in times past.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>RLST 28511.  Star Wars and Religion.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
This course puts religious texts in conversation with George Lucas's popular Star Wars film franchise with an eye toward understanding the power of myth in human life. In interviews, Lucas confessed he took bits and pieces from a variety of religious traditions to create the mythology of Star Wars. Through close readings of the films and primary texts from different religions, students will analyze these influences and evaluate how well the films hold these religious elements together. This course is not an in-depth study of any one religious tradition, but draws elements from different traditions to shed light on the portrayal of religion within Star Wars (i.e., the Force) and the metaphysical and moral themes found in the Star Wars films. [This course features additional Monday discussion sections, scheduled in accordance with students' availability.]</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>RLST 28590.  Sandworms, Spice, and Spirituality: Religion in Frank Herbert's Dune.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
Dune is widely considered a masterpiece of science fiction, and the success of its recent film adaptation attests to its continuing appeal. Yet in addition to its characters and worldbuilding, Dune also offers insightful portrayals of religion and explores religion's roles in society and culture. How do a community's ecological, economic, and political contexts shape their religious beliefs? In what ways do beliefs change or develop over time? Why are rituals such important parts of religious systems? How do stories about &quot;salvation&quot; and the &quot;end times&quot; shape communal identity, purpose, and behavior? In this course, we will ponder these and other questions by placing Dune in conversation with the Qur'an, the Bible, and other religious texts to see how the same dynamics are at play. No prior reading or knowledge of the novel required.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course will explore the fascinating culture of covering and veiling sacred icons, portraits and images that were thought to cause trauma or outrage in the European tradition. It will begin in the ancient world and explore mediaeval, Renaissance and modern art - both paintings and sculptures, as well as images that represent the covering of images…   It will attempt to restore the sensual, the tactile and the performative to the experience of viewing art and engaging with its powers, by contrast to the prevailing regime of disinterested contemplation encouraged by the modernist art gallery.  The course will be taught with much encouragement to students to experiment and think against the grain.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course will present an interdisciplinary interrogation into the nature of pilgrimage in pre-Christian antiquity and the rise of Christian pilgrimage in the years after Constantine.  It will simultaneously be a reflection on the disciplinary problems of examining the phenomena of pilgrimage from various standpoints including art history, archaeology, anthropology, the history of religions, the literary study of travel writing, as well as on the difficulties of reading broad and general theories against the bitty minutiae of ancient evidence and source material.  The core material, beyond the theoretical overview, will be largely limited to antiquity and early Christianity; but if students wish to write their papers on areas beyond this relatively narrow remit (in other religions, in the middle ages, modern or early modern periods), this will be positively encouraged!   The course will be examined by a paper due at the end of the quarter.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>RLST 28901.  Religion, Science, Naturalism: Is There a Problem?  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
The idea that &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;science&quot; are basically at odds with one another - that they involve, indeed, essentially different kinds of rationality - is surely foremost among the ideas that arguably distinguish modernity. This class will consider some of the various ways in which that conclusion has been resisted by some twentieth- and twenty-first-century thinkers, drawing on a range of philosophical and religious perspectives - those, for example, of the Anglo-Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (who would complicate our understanding of what it means to &quot;believe&quot; anything); the German theologian Rudolf Bultmann (whose method precisely distinguished existential questions from scientific ones); and the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet (who thinks it imperative that the limits of scientific understanding be acknowledged in light of a Buddhist critique). Particular attention will be given to early writings from American pragmatist philosopher-scientists (William James, C. S. Peirce, and John Dewey), who argued that it is a mistake in the first place to think religion necessarily concerns anything &quot;supernatural&quot;; religion, for these thinkers, can therefore be understood as wholly consistent with naturalism.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>RLST 28929.  Cabal, Cult, and Crisis: Religion and Contemporary Conspiracy Theory.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
We live in an age of crisis for liberal democracy, and conspiracy theories are often said to be at the heart of this crisis. While Alex Jones, Infowars, and QAnon have become household names, there is still no consensus on what makes a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; or how scholars should approach these topics. Are &quot;New World Order&quot;-style conspiracy beliefs irrational or false on their face? Can liberal-democratic regimes which pride themselves on their ability to accommodate diverse religious viewpoints successfully integrate conspiracy believers? In this course, we will approach the subject of conspiracy theory by engaging with theorists in their own words, videos, and images, while sampling a range of academic and public-facing literature on new religious movements, religion and politics, and epistemology. In so doing, we will apply critical lenses of diverse sorts to mixed media, as we collectively develop methodologies for carrying out original research on &quot;low-status&quot; subjects using un-curated archives. No prior acquaintance with conspiracy-oriented materials required.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

These questions are only the latest battlefields in the &quot;culture wars,&quot; the long-running conversation-or, more often, shouting match-about how Americans ought to live. This seminar will explore how Americans have wrestled with questions of morality and national identity since the country's founding. Two questions will drive our discussion. First, why do certain issues become the subject of fierce cultural conflict? Second, do these conflicts enrich or undermine American democracy?</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course explores western perspectives, attitudes and representations of Muslims and Islam from medieval European thought, through liberal colonial encounters to contemporary media and political discourses. Students will examine the intersection of race and religion as it applies to the construction of Muslim identity and alterity in the Western imagination. We will explore the remarkable consistency across centuries of the threatening, menacing, barbaric and uncivilized Muslim &quot;Other&quot;. The course centers around these Orientalist constructions and will explore the power structures, colonial modalities, epistemological frameworks, and ideological assumptions that perpetuate the racialization of Islam and Muslims within the United States and abroad. This course ultimately aims to uncover potentials for resistance, recovery and renewal through the politics and praxis of decoloniality. Students will gain familiarity with decolonial theory and practices, as well as the important project of 'epistemic delinking' as it is framed by contemporary scholars intent on challenging, possibly undoing and remapping the Muslim experience within global liberal political modernity.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

In the United States, everything is for sale-including religion. Religious books, objects, and films are produced and marketed to recruit converts and to entertain and edify adherents. Churches can be seen as commodities as people &quot;shop&quot; for a new congregation or sect. Some scholars have suggested that consumption itself has become a religious act, with its own rites, rituals, and promises of salvation. In this course we will explore the intersecting histories of Christianity and consumer culture in the US from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Reading classic texts in history and sociology, as well as more contemporary scholarship on American consumer culture, we will attend to the questions that consumer culture poses for American Christians and for scholars of religion. Has consumer culture contributed to the secularization of American society? Has Christianity been corrupted by consumer culture? Can Christians redeem the marketplace? How can the study of religion help us understand our culture of consumption, and how can consumerism help us understand religion?</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>RLST 29300.  Asceticism: Forming the Self.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
In recent decades scholars of the pre-modern period have turned to the body as a site of renewed historical inquiry. Within the study of religion, this shift has reanimated discussions around asceticism as a particularly potent technē for self-fashioning. Nevertheless, scholars have struggled to theorize asceticism across religious traditions. This signature course, taught by two scholars working in disparate historical periods and religious traditions (early  Christianity and medieval Indian religious literature), explores how gender theory has engaged ascetic practices for understanding the body and human potential.  Students will engage asceticism as a series of techniques or forms of life that envision the sexed and gendered human body as the horizon of corporeal expression and personal imagination. Asceticism serves as a neat conceptual device, allowing us to toggle between the mind and body while tackling questions that fall within the liminal space between them, including debates around gender, sexuality, sovereignty, and biopower.  Students along with the instructors will contend with the challenges and opportunities of transnational and transhistorical feminist and queer inquiry as we traverse across the boundaries of tradition, language, and culture. While drawing on rich historical and religious archives, we will anchor our discussions around the interplay of two principal authors: Giorgio Agamben and Michel Foucault.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

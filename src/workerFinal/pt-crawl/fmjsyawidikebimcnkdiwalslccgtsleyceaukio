                    the west-east position of locations on the Earth's surface

                    Meridian</a> </b>(<b>Figure 2b-2</b>). The position of the

                    to be in-line with the location of the former astronomical
                    observatory at Greenwich, England. Because the Earth's circumference
                    is similar to circle, it was decided to measure longitude
                    in degrees. The number of degrees found in a circle is 360.
                    The Prime Meridian has a value of zero degrees. A line of

                    to distinguish where a location is found relative to the

                    uses the Transverse Mercator projection system to model the

                    divides the world's surface into 60 - six degree longitude
                    wide zones that run north-south (<b>Figure 2b-5</b>). These
                    zones start at the International Date Line and are successively
                    numbered in an eastward direction (<b>Figure 2b-5</b>). Each

                    2b-4</b>). In the center of each of these zones is a central
                    meridian. Location is measured in these zones from a <b><a href="../physgeoglos/f.html#false_origin">false
                    origin</a> </b>which is determined relative to the intersection
                    of the equator and the central meridian for each zone. For
                    locations in the Northern Hemisphere, the false origin is
                    500,000 meters west of the central meridian on the equator.
                    Coordinate measurements of location in the Northern Hemisphere
                    using the <b>UTM</b> system
                    are made relative to this point in meters in <b><a href="../physgeoglos/e.html#easting">eastings</a></b> (longitudinal

                    distance). The point defined by the intersection of 50&deg; North
                    and 9&deg; West would have a <b>UTM</b> coordinate

                    w e have learned that depicting the Earth's three-dimensional
                    surface on a two-dimensional map creates a number of distortions
                    that involve distance, area, and direction. It is possible
                    to create maps that are somewhat equidistance. However, even
                    these types of maps have some form of distance distortion.
                    Equidistance maps can only control distortion along either
                    lines of <b><a href="../physgeoglos/l.html#latitude">latitude</a></b> or
                    lines of <b><a href="../physgeoglos/l.html#longitude">longitude</a></b>.
                    Distance is often correct on equidistance maps only in the
                    direction of latitude. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="+1">On a map that has a large scale, 1:125,000
                    or larger, distance distortion is usually insignificant.
                    An example of a large-scale map is a standard topographic
                    map. On these maps measuring straight line distance is simple.
                    Distance is first measured on the map using a ruler. This
                    measurement is then converted into a real world distance
                    using the map's scale. For example, if we measured a distance
                    of 10 centimeters on a map that had a scale of 1:10,000,
                    we would multiply 10 (distance) by 10,000 (scale). Thus,
                    the actual distance in the real world would be 100,000 centimeters. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Measuring distance along map features that
                    are not straight is a little more difficult. One technique
                    that can be employed for this task is to use a number of
                    straight-line segments. The accuracy of this method is dependent
                    on the number of straight-line segments used (<b>Figure 2b-7</b>).
                    Another method for measuring curvilinear map distances is
                    to use a mechanical device called an <b><a href="../physgeoglos/o.html#opisometer">opisometer</a></b>.
                    This device uses a small rotating wheel that records the
                    distance traveled. The recorded distance is measured by this
                    device either in centimeters or inches.</font></p>

                    was once a difficult task. In most cases, it required the
                    use of a topographic map and landscape features to estimate
                    location. However, technology has now made this task very

                    can calculate one's location to an accuracy of about 30-meters
                    (<b>Figure 2b-11</b>). These systems consist of two parts:
                    a GPS receiver and a network of many satellites. Radio transmissions
                    from the satellites are broadcasted continually. The GPS
                    receiver picks up these broadcasts and through triangulation
                    calculates the altitude and spatial position of the receiving
                    unit. A minimum of three satellite is required for triangulation. </font></p>

<h3><a name=purpose><font face="Times New Roman">Statement of Purpose</font></a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1981, a remarkable court case in Arkansas pitted creationists against
pastors, priests, teachers, and scientists. &quot;McLean et al. vs.
Arkansas&quot; sought relief from Arkansas' Act 590, which mandated that
evolutionary biology instruction be balanced with &quot;creation science&quot;.
Unlike the 1925 Scopes trial in Tennessee, the Arkansas court heard testimony
from a large number of witnesses on both sides of the case. Judge Overton ruled
in favor of the plaintiffs, and Act 590 was deemed unconstitutional. Overton's
clearly written decision has been widely reprinted, and is available on the Web at several locations (see the link to Overton's decision <a href="#McLean v. Arkansas decision">below</a>).</font> </p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, the actual trial transcript with its documentation of the stances
of the various witnesses and arguments of the attorneys is not generally
available.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">There are several reasons why this trial's transcript should be
preserved for posterity and distributed widely. Although Arkansas did not
appeal the decision, leaving the issue open at the national level, the trial
and eloquent decision have influenced further cases dealing with young-earth
creationist legal challenges. Indeed, just a few years later a similar measure
in Louisiana was also ruled unconstitutional pre-trial (Aguillard vs. Treen),
and Louisiana's final appeal before the Supreme Court failed in 1987(follow <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html">this
link</a> to the copy of the SCOTUS decision in this case on the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/">Talk.Origins
  Archive</a>). But the
Louisiana case never actually involved the testimony of expert witnesses. This
leaves the testimony given in Arkansas as a unique record of the stances taken
by both anti-evolutionists and their opponents.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately this unique record is in danger. The trial was covered by two court
reporters, one for each side's section of the trial. Court reporters use a
shorthand recording machine to make a record of the proceedings. The use of the
shorthand recording, though, may vary between court reporters. Thus, each court
reporter must transcribe the recording in order to produce a transcript that
can be read by others. While the plaintiff's side of the trial has been transcribed,
the defense side has not. Further, time is not kind to court records. While one
might expect complete record-keeping within the justice system, the sad truth
is that errors happen. The plaintiff's part of the trial is already missing the
testimony of Francisco Ayala. The defense part, with its interesting testimony
from antievolutionists under oath, has not yet been transcribed. It is also
stored out-of-state, which increases the odds that portions will have been
misplaced.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The McLean v. Arkansas Documentation Project</i> seeks to preserve and propagate this
unique resource. We aim to recover as much of the trial transcript as possible
at this time, and to produce an online text containing the transcript for study
and reference. We also will attempt to collect and make available ancillary
documents related to the trial.</font> </p>

<p><b><a name="Act 590 of 1981"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Act
590 of 1981</font></a></b></p>
<blockquote>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Wendell Bird, a graduate of Yale Law School, penned a draft resolution for
the Institute for Creation Research. The ICR printed and distributed thousands
of copies, with the advice that the resolution was intended to be used at the
level of local school boards. Paul Ellwanger (Founder of the South Carolina
group, Citizens for Fairness in Education) modified this draft resolution and
distributed it, but with the intent of having it passed as law by states.
Although Ellwanger's draft bill was proposed in many states, it only passed in
one: Arkansas. There, it followed a path from Ellwanger to a minister, W. A.
Blount, to an Arkansas state legislator, James L. Holsted. Introduced late in the
legislative session, Act 590 was quickly moved through the Senate and then the
House with little discussion. Act 590 was signed into law by Governor Frank
White about a week after its introduction in the Senate (<a href="#trialanderror">[TAE]</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Follow <a href="http://www.icr.org/pubs/imp/imp-071.htm">this link</a> to the
draft resolution by Wendell Bird. Note the similarities between the
&quot;Clarifications&quot; and &quot;Finding of facts&quot; sections of Act 590
to Birds resolution.</font></p>

Carolina school district (scroll down). Note that this link leads to a page that
contains several short articles written about the efforts of Mr. Ellwanger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

An effort was made to obtain the defendant's
portion of the trial transcript. Unfortunately, it had not been transcribed at
the time of the case (the state of Arkansas did not appeal Overton's ruling).
This meant that we would be paying page transcription charges, not just copying
charges. However, the court reporter said that her request for the original
shorthand record came back with a &quot;not found&quot; result. These materials
have apparently been mislaid at the storage facility that the state of Arkansas
uses for older legal records. We are trying to come up with ways to get a more

concerning the desirability of having the trial transcript. At the 1999

discussion with Don Frack, Troy Britain, Mark Todd, John Castalano, and Wesley

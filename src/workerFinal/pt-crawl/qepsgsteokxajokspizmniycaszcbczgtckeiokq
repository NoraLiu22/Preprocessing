The Australian Capital Territory also now uses the Hare-Clark system, after trying the &lsquo;modified d&rsquo;Hondt&rsquo; system. The 1989 and 1992 elections were held under the set of electoral rules known as the &lsquo;modified d'Hondt&rsquo; system which combines the party list method used in France, Belgium, Austria and other European parliaments (d&rsquo;Hondt) with elements of Hare-Clark and various methods for preferential voting for candidates and for parties.<br /><br />

<h2>Country Information<br>
</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/"><img
 src="../GRAPHICS/fblogomed.jpg" nosave="" align="left" border="0"
 height="123" hspace="5" width="209"> </a> When I was an
undergraduate, one of my roommates was a fellow geography major who had
a summer job at the Central Intelligence Agency. His job was to develop
consistent population estimates for the world's twenty largest cities.
This was my first exposure to the geographic work of the CIA. The <a
 href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/">Fact Book</a>
once was an excellent and reasonably objective source of basic
information about all the countries of the world. It is a good starting
point for research and high-quality maps, but the caution below should
now be considered.</p>
<p><b>CAUTION</b>: On December 18, 2003, the CIA Fact Book was
overhauled in a politically-motivated process, in which many of the
country histories were rewritten. Virtually all references to historic
mistakes by the U.S. were sanitized, and most left-leaning governments
are now described in the most pejorative terms. The site can no longer
be considered a valid source of historic information, though most of
the basic facts are probably still accurate.<br>
</p>
<p>As you use the Fact Book, consider these alternative sources: </p>
<p>The BBC maintains <a
 href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/country_profiles/default.stm">
country profiles</a> for every country in the world. Each includes a
timeline of major events and links to BBC stories about the country.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.newint.org/concept3/profile.htm">NI Country
Profiles</a> from <i>New Internationalist</i> magazine include a
number of interesting means of comparing countries, such as literacy,
status of women, and environmental protection.<br>
</p>
<p>Another good source of country-by-country information -- including
good, basic maps -- is the <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/dest/">Lonely
Planet</a> web site.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.countryreports.org/">CountryReports.org</a> </b>
provides country information from around the world.&nbsp; It is an
excellent resource for business, tourists, students and teachers. It
includes both basic data -- such as maps, flags, and national anthem
sound files -- and more detailed information and links for all the
countries of the world. This site began as E-Conflict World
Encyclopedia, whose motto was "<font color="#cc0000"> E</font>radicate <font
 color="#cc0000"> Conflict</font> by Increasing Cultural Awareness."<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.d-i-s-c-o-v-e-r.com/">Discover the World</a> is a
web directory organized by country. It is a simple, elegant site with
carefully chosen links in a number of categories, both interesting and
practical.<br>

A great geographic paradox is that U.S. is both a very mobile society
and a nation of homebodies. The average person moves houses every few
years, quite often out of state. This is particularly true during
periods of strong economic growth. Many people, however, like where
they live, never moving far from home, and perhaps not even visiting
other regions during their entire lifetime. Such people know that the
United States is large and varied, but probably do not know just how
varied it can be in cultural terms. Having been
to most regions of the country, I assert that this excellent article (<a
 href="http://www.massinc.org/commonwealth/new_map_exclusive/beyond_red_blue.html">
Beyond Red and Blue</a> ) by Robert David Sullivan is among the best
descriptions I have seen of the amazing variety of perspectives that
are found in the United States. <br>

<h2> Some Geography Departments &amp; Geography Professors</h2>
I am a faculty member in the Department of Earth Sciences and Geography
at <a href="http://www.bridgew.edu">Bridgewater State College</a> . I
work with Dr. Peter J. Saccocia on the <a
 href="http://www.bridgew.edu/depts/earscgeo/"> department's web page</a>
.<br>
<p>I highly recommend <a
 href="http://www.Colorado.EDU/geography/virtdept/resources/contents.htm">
Internet Resources for Geographers</a> at the University of
Texas at Austin. </p>
<p>In 1986, I received the BA in <a href="http://www.umbc.edu/ges/">
geography</a> from <a href="http://www.umbc.edu/">UMBC</a> . </p>
<p>In 1989, I received the MA in <a
 href="http://www.cas.muohio.edu/geo/"> geography</a> from <a
 href="http://www.miami.muohio.edu/">Miami University </a> of Ohio. </p>
<p>I received my Ph.D. in <a href="http://geog.arizona.edu/%7Eweb/">geography</a>
and <a href="http://w3.arizona.edu/%7Elaac">Latin American Area Studies</a>
at the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu">University of Arizona</a> in
Tucson. </p>
<p>Geographer and friend Roy Brooks from South most Texas recommends
the
web sites of the geography departments at the <a
 href="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/geography/"> University of Texas</a>
and <a href="http://geog.tamu.edu/newpage/">Texas A&amp;M</a> .
I'm happy to include them, as I used to teach geography for both
institutions. I was at outlying campuses (in Texas, that can be <i>very</i>
outlying!), though, and my Texas friends assure me I'm neither Longhorn
nor Aggie.
Those outlying campuses were in Brownsville and Alice, which itself was
an extension of A&amp;M Kingsville. </p>
<p>The Department of <a href="http://www.tesag.jcu.edu.au/"> Tropical
Environment Studies &amp; Geography</a> at James Cook University in
North Queensland, Australia has an interesting web site. </p>
<p>Dr. Susan Woodward at Radford University in Virginia is a leader in
the use of the web to teach bio geography. The home page for her <a
 href="http://www.runet.edu/%7Eswoodwar/CLASSES/GEOG235/biogeog.html">
bio geography course</a> includes her own excellent resources and links
to others in bio geography, especially to virtual field trips. <br>

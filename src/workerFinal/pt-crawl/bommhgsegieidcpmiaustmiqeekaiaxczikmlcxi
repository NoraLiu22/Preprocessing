/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 196]]</font> Mr. Weldon's 
        letter on this subject, in <em>Nature</em> of May 3, calls, I think, for 
        a few further observations. He first criticises the statement that &quot;the 
        survival-mean must, on cessation of selection, fall to the birth-mean,&quot; 
        by showing that there are probably cases in nature in which the survival 
        and birth-means may coincide, owing to the removal by selection of all 
        individuals above and below the mean, they being approximately equal in 
        number. This is, no doubt, the case with certain characters of a species, 
        but probably never with all or even with most characters. Darwin states 
        that in France and Germany white pigeons are killed off by kites, and 
        that on the coast of Ireland black fowls are also killed off by sea-eagles. 
        These and other analogous facts render it probable that in many species 
        of animals colour is kept to the inconspicuous and protective mean tint 
        by the elimination of all individuals which vary much on either side of 
        it, and thus, as regards colour, the birth-mean and the survival-mean 
        may be almost identical. But with many other characters this is not the 
        case. In sheep, cattle, and horses it has been observed that when the 
        larger lowland breeds are taken to bleak mountain regions they gradually 
        dwindle in size, only the smaller and hardier of each generation surviving 
        the severe winter and spring climate and the comparatively innutritious 
        food. Here the elimination is clearly in one main direction; and the absence 
        of this selection due to the transference of the whole body of such reduced 
        individuals to a milder climate and better pastures, would no doubt lead 
        to a slight increase of average size, indicating that the birth-mean had 
        been above the survival-mean. So also in the case of the half- <font color="990000">[[p. 
        197]]</font> wild horses of Circassia, which are greatly exposed to attacks 
        of wolves and to extreme vicissitudes of climate, swiftness, strength, 
        wariness, and a hardy constitution must be kept at a high level of efficiency 
        by the elimination of the less gifted in these qualities; so that here 
        again the birth-mean must be below the survival-mean. In such cases as 
        these there seems no difficulty in the fact that the mean characters do 
        not change for many generations; for this is in accordance with Darwin's 
        principle that natural selection &quot;cannot produce absolute perfection, 
        but only relative perfection.&quot; When the average characters of a species 
        have reached a point such that it can permanently maintain itself in a 
        given area, then no further change will occur; but, the less efficient 
        being constantly weeded out, the survival-mean will be necessarily a little 
        above the birth-mean. Both means will, however, be sensibly permanent 
        as long as the environment remains unchanged.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Weldon says that it has not been shown that, 
        in some given case, Panmixia does in fact occur; and further, that in 
        the only case which has been experimentally investigated--that of the 
        stature of civilised Englishmen--the consequences said to result from 
        it do not, in fact, occur. To obtain absolute evidence of Panmixia, or 
        of the action of Natural Selection, is extremely difficult, because we 
        cannot first compare and measure minutely a large number of individuals 
        in a state of nature, and then follow those same individuals throughout 
        their lives and see how nature deals with them. We can, however, observe 
        what happens in the case of semi-wild animals, and the examples already 
        cited show that natural selection must, and actually does, act on the 
        character of colour, weeding out those which diverge on both sides towards 
        whiteness or blackness, and in the case of physical and mental activities 
        destroying those which fall below the standard of excellence requisite 
        for the preservation and continuance of life.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our domesticated animals, on the other hand, 
        we find what are probably examples of the effects of Panmixia. The wing-bones 
        of our pigeons, fowls, and ducks, as compared with wild individuals, were 
        found by Darwin to be decidedly reduced in size in proportion to the leg-bones; 
        but a part of this may be due to disuse in the individual, and to determine 
        the share of the two causes seems impossible. There are, however, a few 
        characters in which we see Panmixia alone at work in our domesticated 
        animals. Such are, for example, the constant appearance and increase among 
        them of prominent <em>unsymmetrical</em> markings, as in dogs, cats, cattle, 
        and horses. Such markings never occur in wild races, or if they occur 
        in individual cases they never increase; and I have given reasons for 
        thinking that symmetrical colour and marking is kept up in nature for 
        facility of recognition, a factor essential to preservation, and to the 
        formation of new species. In this case, there can be no question of disuse, 
        while as we know that white and unsymmetrical individuals do occasionally 
        occur in wild species, but never increase, the fact of their increase 
        under domestication must be due to the absence of whatever form of natural 
        selection eliminates them in nature; that is, to Panmixia. Another illustration 
        may perhaps be found in the fact of curled tails appearing in domestic 
        pigs and some races of dogs, while no wild animal is known which has a 
        curled tail. We can hardly doubt that the special form of tail in each 
        animal is of use to it, and that any abnormality, like a curled tail, 
        would be eliminated under nature. Its appearance and perpetuation under 
        domestication is therefore a fair example of Panmixia.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slow increase of the stature of civilised 
        Englishmen, which Mr. Galton is said to have proved, may, it seems to 
        me, be partly a result of Panmixia, and partly due to more healthy conditions 
        of life acting on the individual. It is, I presume, a fact, as generally 
        stated, that old armour shows that the knights of the middle ages were 
        rather short men. This may have been a result of natural selection, because, 
        as a rule, the strongest and most active men are rather under than over 
        middle height; while tall men would certainly be more exposed to danger, 
        would have to carry a greater weight of armour, and by thus overloading 
        their horses would be under a disadvantage in battle. Tall men would thus 
        be killed off rather faster than short men; and the same might be the 
        case even after the disuse of armour, so long as rapine and civil war 
        prevailed over a large part of the country. But during the last two centuries 
        of comparative peace tall men have been under no such disadvantage, and 
        their survival may have aided in bringing about the slight increase of 
        average stature which has been observed.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point in Mr. Weldon's communication 
        requires notice. He considers that the frequent occurrence of abnormalities 
        and the wide range of variation in many species, show that &quot;natural selection 
        is in most cases an imperfect agent in the adjustment of organisms.&quot; This 
        conclusion does not appear to me to be a logical one, since it ignores 
        the admitted fact of the exceedingly intermittent character of selection 
        and its constantly varied <em>locus</em> of action. Each species of animal 
        is subject to a number of quite distinct dangers--hunger, cold, wet, disease, 
        and varied enemies--and all these are separately intermittent in their 
        action. Some affect the species at one time of the year only, some at 
        another; but most of them only reach their maximum of intensity at long 
        intervals--once or twice, perhaps, in a century. Whether cold winters 
        or hot summers, excessive drought or excessive wet, deep snow or phenomenal 
        hail or wind-storms, all are intermittent and occur with extreme severity 
        only at long intervals. These intermittent waves of meteorological phenomena 
        have their corresponding &quot;waves of life,&quot; as Mr. Hudson well terms them, 
        such as phenomenal swarms of locusts or of wasps, of caterpillars, mice, 
        or lemmings, and to a less conspicuous degree of almost every living thing. 
        It follows, that during a succession of favourable seasons variation can 
        go on almost unchecked, and even hurtful abnormalities and imperfections 
        may survive for a few years, but soon there comes a check to the increase, 
        and the most abnormal forms die out; while after a greater or less interval 
        either adverse seasons or an increase of living enemies weed out all the 
        extreme disadvantageous variations, leaving only the pick of the typical 
        form to continue the race. This may occur again and again, each special 
        period of stress affecting different organs or faculties--now abnormal 
        colour, now deficient agility, now again incaution or a weak digestion--till 
        in turn every departure from the best adapted mean form is eliminated, 
        to again arise and again be extinguished as favourable or unfavourable 
        conditions prevail. Thus, I am fully in agreement with Mr. Thiselton Dyer 
        when he said: &quot;I feel more and more that natural selection is a very hard 
        taskmaster, and that it is down very sharply on structural details that 
        cannot give an account of themselves.&quot; (<em>Nature</em>, vol. xxxix. p. 
        9.) The appearance of imperfect adjustment is thus only a temporary phenomenon, 
        while that there is an underlying permanent adjustment is indicated by 
        the long-continued identity of specific characters to which Mr. Weldon 
        refers.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is very important to obtain some direct 
        evidence of the action of natural selection, I wish to suggest a mode 
        of doing so which might probably be successful. There is much evidence 
        to show that the migrating birds which visit us in early summer are very 
        largely old birds which have lived through two or more migrations; and, 
        consequently, that of the large number of young birds which migrate in 
        autumn for the first time a very small proportion return to our shores. 
        If this is so, then the extreme severity of the selection during migration 
        would afford us the opportunity of determining some of the physical characters 
        which influence it, combined no doubt with mental characteristics which 
        we have no means of gauging. I would suggest, therefore, that two or three 
        common species of migrants should be chosen, of which the young birds 
        of the year can be distinguished with certainty. Of these birds a number 
        of observers should collect specimens just before their autumnal migration, 
        and should carefully record the characters fixed upon in the case of the 
        young and old birds separately. Probably the weight, the total length, 
        and the length of the wing, would be sufficient, since heavy birds with 
        comparatively short wings would hardly be adapted for a long-continued 
        flight. By laying down the dimensions of some hundreds of specimens in 
        curves of variation, whatever difference existed between the young and 
        old birds would be easily detected; and this difference would presumably 
        be the difference between the birth-mean and the survival-mean, so far 
        as the selective influence of migration is concerned. In the following 
        spring another set of specimens of the same species should be collected 
        and measured; and we should then perhaps be able to determine the characters 
        which had led to the selection of the young birds which had survived the 
        double migration.</p>

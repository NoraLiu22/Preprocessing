/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 478]]</font> I have 
          just received from Mr. T. Mellard Reade, F.G.S., a copy of his paper 
          on the &quot;Age of the Earth&quot; (which appeared in your <em>Magazine</em> 
          of July last), in which I am asked to put that gentleman right as regards 
          what he calls his &quot;analysis&quot; of some figures and estimates given in 
          my &quot;Island Life&quot;; and I gladly seize the first opportunity of doing 
          so. To avoid the necessity of repeating my own statements as well as 
          those of Mr. Reade, I must ask the reader who is interested in this 
          matter to refer back to the above-mentioned article.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first statement of Mr. Reade's which I 
          have to &quot;put right&quot; is the following:--&quot;It is evident, if the figures 
          mean anything at all, that three millions of square miles 177,200 feet 
          thick represent the whole of the rock removed by denudation in all forms 
          since the geological history of the earth began. Spread this over 57 
          million square miles of land and we get a deposit 9326 feet thick deposited 
          in all geological time.&quot; This is not quite an accurate representation 
          of my statements. The figures quoted represent, not the whole matter 
          denuded, but only that portion of which a record still exists in the 
          rocks; and this matter has been deposited, not &quot;in all geological time,&quot; 
          but only in that portion of geological time indicated by the known series 
          of stratified rocks; unconformities and other breaks representing unknown 
          intervals of which we have no <font color="990000">[[p. 479]]</font> 
          record. With these corrections the figures used by me do imply what 
          Mr. Reade says they do; which is, in other words,--that the average 
          thickness of that portion of the earth's crust formed by the known stratified 
          rocks does not probably exceed nine or ten thousand feet.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Reade, however, without directly impugning 
          these figures, attempts to show that they lead to absurd or incredible 
          results, and he does this by manipulating them in a way which is altogether 
          beyond my comprehension. He first says, that these rocks have been made 
          and destroyed over and over again; and then argues that, <em>because</em> 
          the exposed igneous rocks cover about 1/12 of the land surface, <em>therefore</em> 
          &quot;each particle of rock, on the average, has been denuded and laid down 
          at least twelve times.&quot; I have in vain tried to see any connection between 
          these two statements, but what follows is still more unintelligible. 
          Mr. Reade adds:--&quot;From this it follows that the actual thickness of 
          the sedimentary crust of the earth, if there were no sedimentary rocks 
          except on the site of the present land areas, <em>would be</em> 12/9326 
          = 777 feet.&quot; Correcting the clerical error of 12/9326 instead of 9326/12, 
          this means that, because the stratified rocks have been successively 
          formed from the denudation of older rocks (stratified and igneous), 
          therefore their <em>actual</em> thickness would be many times less than 
          by estimates founded on direct measurement it is known they <em>actually</em> 
          are! It is, I think, evident that, from Mr. Reade's point of view, he 
          should have here multiplied instead of divided by 12. For if the older 
          rocks have been reduced in thickness by denudation, and their d&eacute;bris 
          has gone to form newer rocks in each successive epoch, it is clear that 
          when first deposited all the rocks <em>would have been</em> thicker 
          than now, though there is no definite relation between the number of 
          successive formations and their greater thickness, as Mr. Reade seems 
          to suppose. For example, if half the original Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks 
          have been denuded to form the Mesozoic and parts of the later rocks, 
          and half of the original Mesozoic to form the Tertiary, and half these 
          again to form glacial and recent deposits, each would have been at first 
          about twice as thick as it is now,--not one-fourth the thickness, as 
          Mr. Reade's mode of calculation would make them; and as the whole problem 
          is one of the <em>time</em> taken to produce these various deposits, 
          the greater original thickness would have to be used in the calculation.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, even if Mr. Reade's figures are thus 
          corrected, his whole criticism is radically unsound; for, as I have 
          explained in my original discussion of the subject, denudation is so 
          unequal in its action and occurs so generally on the edges of uplifted 
          strata not over their surfaces of deposit, that it would be quite possible 
          for 9/10 or even 99/100 of a formation to be destroyed by denudation, 
          and yet for the remaining 1/10 or 1/100 to give a fairly accurate measure 
          of the <em>average</em> thickness or even sometimes of a <em>maximum</em> 
          thickness of the original deposit. Our measures of the thickness of 
          the sedimentary rocks will, therefore, not be seriously affected by 
          the fact that by far the larger portion of all of them have been destroyed 
          by denudation, and again and again laid down to form newer rocks; and 
          as I have <font color="990000">[[p. 480]]</font> used measures of the 
          <em>maximum</em> thicknesses, I have considered that these would in 
          all probability not differ much from the original <em>average</em> thicknesses 
          of the same rocks before they had suffered denudation. No doubt some 
          rocks may have been wholly destroyed by denudation, or are so covered 
          up by later deposits as to be beyond our reach, and to allow for these 
          I am willing to admit that my estimate of the whole thickness of the 
          rocks, and therefore of the time taken to produce them, may have to 
          be considerably increased; but this would bring my figures nearer to 
          those usually arrived at, not enormously further from them as Mr. Reade 
          endeavours to prove.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet again, Mr. Reade points out that continents 
          have fluctuated, and have sometimes been larger than now. To allow for 
          this he doubles the land surface and reduces the corresponding thickness 
          of the strata to one-half! But, surely, if the continents have been 
          sometimes larger, they have also been sometimes smaller, and I see no 
          reason to think we can take any fairer <em>average</em> than that of 
          the present area; and even if the average <em>had</em> been double, 
          then the denudation and the deposit would presumably have been double 
          also, not half as Mr. Reade suggests.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to my fundamental position--that 
          the areas of deposition are (and always have been) very much smaller 
          than the areas of denudation, and that, in making any estimate of geological 
          time founded on the thickness of the sedimentary rocks and the known 
          rate of denudation, this fact must be taken account of, Mr. Reade makes 
          no objection; and, whatever &quot;confusion of ideas&quot; may have pervaded my 
          estimate, the subject has certainly not been rendered clearer by his 
          criticism.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as regards the general theory of 
          the &quot;Permanence of Oceans and Continents&quot; (or, more properly, of Oceanic 
          and Continental areas), which Mr. Reade somewhat sneeringly remarks 
          &quot;is now becoming fashionable,&quot;--it is time that its opponents should 
          give up petty criticism of unimportant details or collateral issues, 
          which have little bearing on the main question, and attempt to grapple 
          with the whole body of facts and arguments adduced in its support by 
          some of the first geologists of the day, and which I have endeavoured 
          to set forth in a connected form in the pages of &quot;Island Life.&quot; Any 
          such general examination of the question from an adverse point of view, 
          I have hitherto failed to meet with.</p>

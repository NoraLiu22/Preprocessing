/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

	<i><a name="Christian" id="Christian"></a>Question: Was Wallace a Christian?</i>
	
	</p><p><i>Answer</i>: Wallace has been labeled a Christian by some observers, in good part because he grew up in a religiously fairly orthodox, though not very strictly observing, Church of England household.  But let us see what he himself had to say about the matter.  In 1865 he wrote, in a letter to his friend George Rolleston, "I look upon the doctrine of future rewards and punishments as a motive to action to be radically bad, and as bad for savages as for civilized men. ...I cannot see that the teaching of all this [i.e., respect, moralities, etc.] can be furthered by the dogmas of any religion, and I do not believe that those dogmas really have any effect in advancing morality in one case out of a thousand." In 1908, replying (<a href="S664.htm">S664</a>) to an inquiry, he wrote: "But as one who from boyhood till middle age was a confirmed materialist, and in his later life has become a confirmed spiritualist--but at no time a believer in dogmatic Christianity--my growing impression of late years has been that [the teachings of] Jesus of Nazareth [have been] ... --notwithstanding the gross perversion of his teaching by priests and rulers--of <i>supreme value</i>." In an 1894 book review (<a href="S496.htm">S496</a>) he noted "...[religion] has been one of the most important agencies in social development, and is closely bound up with that portion of our nature to which all recent social advance is due, and which will inevitably decide the course of our future progress. Of course this has nothing to do with dogmatic religion, but only with those great ethical principles which have always formed part of religious teaching, and whose influence is in great part due to it." In 1905, in volume one of his autobiography <i>My Life</i>, he wrote: "My brother never went to church himself, but for the first few years I was with him he sent me once every Sunday; but, of course, the only effect of this was to deepen my spirit of scepticism, as I found no attempt in any of the clergymen to reason on any of the fundamental questions at the root of the Christian and every other religion." Also: "[in the late 1830s/40s] I therefore thoroughly agreed with Mr. Dale Owen's conclusion, that the orthodox religion of the day was degrading and hideous..." Also: "...what little religious belief I had very quickly vanished under the influence of philosophical or scientific scepticism. This came first upon me when I spent a month or two in London [in 1837] with my brother John...; and during the seven years I lived with my brother William, though the subject of religion was not often mentioned, there was a pervading spirit of scepticism, or free-thought as it was then called, which strengthened and confirmed my doubts as to the truth or value of all ordinary religious teaching."  And: "...I was too firmly convinced of the incredibility of large portions of the Bible, and of the absence of sense or reason in many of the doctrines of orthodox religion to be influenced by any such preaching, however eloquent." And: "...by the time I came of age I was absolutely non-religious, I cared and thought nothing about it, and could be best described by the modern term "agnostic." Finally, in an 1898 interview (<a href="S738.htm">S738</a>) he responded unequivocally, when asked about such: "I do not hold any Christian doctrines whatever." These remarks (and one can find further such sentiments in his writings), plus his constant criticizing of religious institutions on various points over the whole of his life, clearly exclude Wallace from consideration as a member of the kingdom of Christianity, and anyone who claims otherwise should immediately be held suspect of having some kind of mealy-mouthed--and likely negative--prior agenda that is being spread at Wallace's expense.

		<i><a name="supernatural" id="supernatural"></a>Question:  What did Wallace actually mean when he used the term 'supernatural'?</i></p> 
<p><i>Answer</i>: The world is sometimes a complicated place… Wallace's view of reality is basically a Spinozian one: that all phenomena are 'real'; i.e., a part of the natural reality.  But the 'super-' in the word seems to imply something that is 'beyond' reality. After he wrote his <i>Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural</i> (<a href="S118A.htm">S118</a>) in 1866 he realized that its title was not properly conveying his concept (perhaps after receiving a 10 February 1867 letter from the publisher Robert Chambers that included the following message: "My idea is that the term supernatural is a gross mistake. We have only to enlarge our conceptions of the natural, and all will be right."). In that work Wallace also uses the terms 'preterhuman', 'preternatural' and 'super-human', and in later writings the words 'supernormal' and 'preter-normal' as well, but none of these, now or then, really convey the shades of meaning he wanted to get at, either.  In 1905 he wrote: "It was called 'The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural,' a somewhat misleading title, as in the introductory chapter I argued for all the phenomena, however extraordinary, being really 'natural' and involving no alteration whatever in the ordinary laws of nature." (S729 vol. 2, p. 280). In a 1913 interview he added: "People sometimes say to me: 'That is not science. You talk of supernatural action.' But it is not supernatural at all. Everything that happens is Nature." (<a href="S752AA.htm">S752aa</a>).  Part of the problem is that today, we usually equate what is 'real' with what occurs in a physical space context; thus, a hallucination is not considered 'real.' Yet the hallucination actually took place, its onset and characteristics having prior causes related to physiology, etc., and its occurrence leaving measurable impact on the physical world (e.g., an elevated heartbeat rate in the experiencer). So it is 'real' after all; it just requires a shift in perspective, as Chambers suggested.  The other is a thought pattern we arguably need to rid ourselves of if we wish to distinguish between, say, a hallucination or dream, and the Christian concept of heaven: the first two may be considered 'real,' however contextualized, whereas in the latter it is the <i>concept/thought</i> of heaven that is real enough, rather than its likely actuality as a natural laws-based destination. Spiritualists like Wallace, by contrast, regarded the 'Spirit Realm' as an 'actual' destination (its non-physicality notwithstanding) underlain by natural law.

	<i><a name="happy" id="happy"></a>Question: Was Wallace really happy with the treatment he received with respect to the handling and publication of his Ternate essay on natural selection?</i></p>

	<p><i>Answer</i>: The popular model of Wallace's response to the way his Ternate manuscript was handled is that he was perfectly happy about it all. Certainly, its publication, even if without his permission, created a lot of useful opportunities for him, while promoting his general agenda. Further, Wallace was a polite man, and in any case there were any number of reasons why he would have kept his mouth buttoned at the time, or even later--and he did. But once he saw the published works (by Darwin and himself) in print, how happy could he have been to read the comments by editors Hooker and Lyell up front, how "both authors having now unreservedly placed their papers in our hands...", knowing that this was certainly not the case? If that had happened to me, I'd have been p----d! In this context, consider the fact that in five separate fine print remarks published in connection with reprints or mentions of the essay over the next thirty-plus years, he lightly observed how he had "never had an opportunity to read the proofs" of the work before it appeared in hardcopy. Are these readable breadcrumbs? This is not a minor matter, as how can we now know just how far Wallace's ideas had progressed by the time of the Ternate essay--that is, to what extent they were fully expressed by it?

	<i><a name="comment1" id="comment1"></a>Question: Why are so many of the Wallace-related comments seen on the Internet, or even in published academic journals, so wildly inaccurate?</i> 

	</p><p><i>Answer</i>: There are two main reasons. First, and more generally, Wallace's worldview is so unique that no small sampling of his writings provides enough of a base to go on. The result is rampant misunderstanding, something that has never stopped people from expressing an opinion, ill-founded though it may be. Second, and just as important, there are several groups of observers who are laboring under seriously self-focused agendas, and Wallace's positions and/or life story often conflicts with these. So, we have: (1) Darwinophiles, who sometimes view Wallace as a challenge to their guy, and are willing to stoop to trumped-up criticisms to bring him down (2) conversely, Darwin-haters, who trivialize Wallace's own contributions by framing him as little more than a victim of conspiracies and/or perceived Darwinian excesses (3) biologists, especially zoologists, who tout his biological achievements to the hilt, while disparaging his ideas on social and spiritual subjects as irrelevant or even a case of split personality (4) intelligent design advocates who distort his final causes-based cosmology into first causes-based positions he never held, and, most recently, (5) 'wokeness': sadly off-base characterizations of his treatment of native peoples and habits as a natural history specimens collector.  Wallace, by virtue of his wide-ranging attachments and 'old-white-guyness' is unfortunately an easy mark for those looking for a scapegoat, and he's no longer around to defend himself.

	<i><a name="igod" id="igod"></a>Question: What were Wallace's thoughts on 'God' as a causal factor in evolution?</i> 
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> In his autobiography <i>My Life</i>, published in 1905, Wallace writes: "at one period of my life, I felt something of religious fervour, derived chiefly from the more picturesque and impassioned of the hymns. As, however, there was no sufficient basis of intelligible fact or connected reasoning to satisfy my intellect, this feeling soon left me, and has never returned," and "by the time I came of age I was absolutely non-religious, I cared and thought nothing about it, and could be best described by the modern term 'agnostic'". Wallace was similarly unimpressed by conventional concepts of 'God', to the extraordinary extent that he almost never used the word in any of his writings, private or for publication, unless he was describing someone else's thoughts. In his correspondence Wallace didn't even indulge himself by using the term in homely ditties such as "God knows" or "in God's name," as Darwin sometimes did. Obviously, he had exiled the notion to the realm of nonconcept. His understanding of global evolution had nothing to do with a first-causes based teleology, instead invoking a final causes kind of approach (note in this regard his cosmological arguments, which have been cited as an anticipatory version of the anthropic principle).

		<i><a name="ispirit" id="ispirit"></a>Question: What was the basis for Wallace's incorporation of spiritualism into his evolutionary model?</i> 
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> The key to understanding Wallace's attraction to spiritualism is that it provided a logical (if unprovable) explanation of how human consciousness might be expanded in an evolutionary sense. Consider the following words, taken from his 'What Are Phantasms?' essay of 1891: "In every case that passes beyond simple transference of a thought from one living person to another, it seems probable that other intelligences co-operate. . . . The powers of communication of spirits with us, and ours of receiving their communications, vary greatly. Some of us can only be influenced by ideas or impressions, which we think are altogether the product of our own minds. Others can be so strongly acted on that they feel an inexplicable emotion, leading to action beneficial to themselves or to others. In some cases, warning or information can be given through dreams, in others by waking vision. Some spirits have the power of producing visual, others audible hallucinations to certain persons . . . " (<a href="S434.htm">S434</a>, pp. 272, 273-274). Such communications, varying from subtle emotional impressions and conscience stimulation to lesson-bearing dreams and premonitional warnings, and never letting up, could be expected to change human behavior in the long run, on the balance for the better. It doesn't seem impossible that something akin to this basic dynamic actually does operate, though not necessarily from causes related to the spiritualists' alleged 'Spirit Realm.'

	<i><a name="idesign" id="idesign"></a>Question: Did Wallace believe in intelligent 
        design?</i> 
      </p>
      <p><i>Answer:</i> No, no, and no--assuming that i.d. leans on the operation
        of first causes as Creationism does, that is. Don't fall for the facile
        understanding being promoted by some agenda-driven observers who argue
        that, just because Wallace was a spiritualist and believed that 
        &quot;higher intelligences&quot; were influencing events here on earth,
         that he also believed in miraculous, non-law-based kinds of Godly intervention.
         Read his own words on this matter <a href="S716note.htm">here</a> (see
         also <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=I17PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false" target="_top">the
         bottom of page 196</a> of Volume 1 of Wallace's autobiography
         <em>My Life</em>, written thirty-five years later and saying essentially
         the same thing). Wallace 
        <i>did</i> increasingly lean toward a model of natural processes invoking
         final causes, but this is quite another matter: even the relatively
        conservative  thinker August Weismann was willing to entertain views
        of final causation  (see <a href="S352.htm">S352</a>), as long as these
        did not rely on vitalist, teleological or creationist assumptions. Are those who explore
        gaian models and the  various versions of the anthropic principle being
        accused of i.d. tendencies?  Well, what Wallace was thinking about in
        some ways closely approaches these lines of thought--only he added to
        the mix the notion that &quot;higher 
        intelligences&quot; might also represent an integral element in the way
         the large-scale program of evolution plays out.

<i><a name="did" id="did"></a>Question: Did Wallace believe in miracles?</i> 
      </p>
      <p><i>Answer:</i> Before trying to answer this question one needs to get 
        a tolerably firm grip on what we want to term a &quot;miracle.&quot; From my (rather 
        conservative) slant on things, it seems a &quot;miracle&quot; might be defined as 
        an event that is wholly inexplicable--not just because we don't know the 
        immediate conditions under which it has taken place, but because its enaction 
        either violates or supersedes known (and perhaps even not yet known) laws 
        of science. Thus, a miracle implies, if not actual direct Godly intervention, 
        then at the very least the operation of some other first cause not subservient 
        to the generally recognized rules of physical existence. Given this starting 
        point, one would have to say that Wallace did <i>not</i> believe in miracles. 
        It's not that he was unwilling to allow that many of the witnessed historical 
        events termed miracles had in fact occurred; indeed, he was satisfied 
        that some, at least, likely had. Obviously, there's a catch. As a spiritualist, 
        Wallace accepted that so-called miraculous events are the product of actions 
        initiated by, or otherwise related to, spirit entities. Significantly, 
        the entities themselves are supposed to exist as &quot;real&quot; things observing 
        natural law (whether yet recognized or understood, or not), and there 
        is thus no reason to invoke first causes-related doctrine to explain how 
        such events are caused. Should this understanding of reality actually 
        turn out to have some validity its significance could hardly be denied; 
        at present, of course, confirming evidence (not to mention theory) is 
        largely . . . lacking. (And yet the devil's advocate might fairly complain 
        that we may well have no idea yet of what &quot;confirming evidence&quot; might 
        represent in this instance.) To summarize: In Wallace's view the notion 
        of a &quot;miracle&quot; was a contradiction in terms; those events that appear 
        miraculous to us do so not because there are inexplicable first causes 
        operating, but instead because we are ignorant of the actualizing forces 
        of nature involved (in this he echoes the position of the Rationalist philosopher Spinoza).

          <i><a name="didwallace" id="didwallace"></a>Question: Did Wallace have a &quot;change of 
			  mind&quot; (actually, a <u>reversal</u> of mind) regarding the applicability of natural selection to the evolution 
          of humankind (i.e., especially insofar as its &quot;higher attributes&quot; are 
          concerned)?</i> 
      </p>
      <p><i>Answer:</i> We don't know yet, and may never know. And in any case, 
        the answer probably cannot be cast in simple &quot;yes or no&quot; terms. First, 
        however, one should always keep in mind that the &quot;change of mind&quot; discussion 
        has nothing to do with Wallace's thoughts on the basic evolution by natural 
        selection of humankind as an animal form (i.e., its fundamental biological 
        structure); on this matter he remained a true &quot;Darwinian&quot; throughout. 
        Still, in 1869 Wallace unmistakably announced his belief that natural 
        selection was not up to explaining the coming into being of the higher 
        rational, moral, and esthetic abilities, and it is now generally thought 
        that in doing so he had retreated from the more materialistic &quot;Darwinian&quot; 
        understanding. Contributing to this impression was his at-that-point recent 
        conversion to spiritualism; this--or possibly even the separate issue 
        of his growing social conscience--has been seen as generating a conflict 
        in his mind regarding the rather cold reality of the survival of the fittest, 
        and what it might mean in the context of human evolution. I personally 
        have a lot of trouble buying any of this. It has usually been assumed 
        that the 1858 &quot;Ternate&quot; paper was meant to espouse a view of natural selection 
        that applied in the same way to humans as it did to other organisms. This, 
        despite the fact that Wallace never once mentions human beings in it, 
        and appears throughout to be fashioning an &quot;exception to the rule&quot; kind 
        of argument. Further, if his line of thought has anything to do with extending 
        his earlier ideas on evolution, why doesn't he refer to any of them in 
        it? And why would Wallace himself deny outright that he had undergone 
        any such change of mind, as he did in the routinely ignored Preface to 
        the book <i>Miracles and Modern Spiritualism</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS717">S717</a>)? 
        In short, the &quot;change of mind&quot; interpretation seems to be based largely 
        on the worst kind of misuse of negative evidence: more probably Wallace 
        deliberately left humankind out of the story in 1858 because at that point 
        he wasn't quite sure how to fit us into the larger scheme of things. In 
        fact, the natural selection concept itself may well have been Wallace's 
        way of establishing a dividing line in this regard. We do know that after 
        1869 Wallace pursued (or continued to pursue?) a peculiarly teleological approach to evolution, 
        one in which final causes were thought to be operating, but it is less 
        well appreciated that before 1858 Wallace's approach was rather Newtonian, 
        and arguably hardly any less final causes-oriented. Natural selection 
        may have turned him around a good deal more than has been realized; perhaps 
        he was merely remaining true to his earlier train of thought when in 1869 
        he came to publicly acknowledge his belief in an existing influence of 
        higher (yet still &quot;natural&quot;) powers. The preceding interpretation is set 
        out in brief in my <a href="../essays/WALLTALK.htm" target="_parent">&quot;Alfred 
        Russel Wallace on Evolution: A Change of Mind?&quot;</a>, in more detail in 
        my <i><a href="../essays/ARWPAMPH.htm" target="_parent">Alfred Russel

        <a name="patha" id="patha"></a><i>Question: Did Wallace follow Darwin on the matter 
        of the posed gradualistic pace of operation of natural selection, and 
        evolution in general?</i> 
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> Wallace has invariably been portrayed--accurately--as 
        a uniformitarian, primarily because of the well-known influence the famous 
        geologist Charles Lyell had on the development of his ideas. Lyell's influence 
        on Darwin was equally notable, and by extension it has usually been assumed 
        that the latter's gradualistic perspective on the operation of natural 
        selection also describes Wallace's position. This turns out to be a significant 
        oversimplification. In several writings (e.g., <a href="S171.htm">S171</a>, 
        p. 104 of <a href="bib2.htm#zS322">S322</a>, p. 518 of <a href="S440.htm">S440</a>, 
        p. 125 of <a href="bib4.htm#zS724">S724</a>, and p. 198 of <a href="S499.htm">S499</a>) 
        some published before and some published after Darwin's death, Wallace 
        reveals his belief that selection regimes most likely produce structural 
        results at a rate better described in terms of alternating stasis and 
        rapid change. For example, on page 125 of <i>Darwinism</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS724">S724</a>) 
        he states: &quot;Mr. Darwin was rather inclined to exaggerate the necessary 
        slowness of the action of natural selection . . . but . . . there seems 
        no difficulty in an amount of change, quite equivalent to that which usually 
        distinguishes allied species, sometimes taking place in less than a century, 
        should any rapid change of conditions necessitate an equally rapid adaptation.&quot; 
        Similarly, on page 518 of <a href="S440.htm">S440</a> he says: &quot;the struggle 
        for existence is intermittent in character, and only reaches a maximum 
        at considerable intervals, which may be measured by tens of years or by 
        centuries. The average number of the individuals of any species which 
        reach maturity may be able to survive for some years in ordinary seasons 
        or under ordinary attacks of enemies, but when exceptional periods of 
        cold or drought or wet occur, with a corresponding scarcity of certain 
        kinds of food, or greater persecution from certain enemies, then a rigid 
        selection comes into play, and all those individuals which vary too far 
        from the mean standard of efficiency are destroyed.&quot; Earlier, in 1880 
        (while Darwin was still alive), he wrote (p. 104 of <a href="bib2.htm#zS322">S322</a>): 
        &quot;...the <i>extreme slowness</i> of the action of natural selection, on 
        which Mr. Darwin repeatedly dwells, is by no means an essential characteristic 
        of it . . . if, as must often have happened, conditions have changed with 
        comparative rapidity, then the enormous amount of individual variation, 
        which would be taken advantage of <i>every year</i> by the survival of 
        the fittest, might effect changes in a single century quite as great as 
        those which distinguish nearly allied species.&quot; For those used to crediting 
        Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould with originating the theory of punctuated 
        equilibria, this should give some pause for thought.

          <a name="pathb" id="pathb"></a><i>Question: Was Wallace a through and through Malthusian, or did he 
          merely use Malthus's ideas as a stepping off point for his own?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> The latter. Wallace's debt to Thomas Malthus on the 
          matter of the &quot;positive checks&quot; (pestilence, starvation, etc.) that 
          keep populations from indefinitely extending themselves is often noted: 
          this understanding helped both he and Darwin create a logical foundation 
          for their models of natural selection. But it is rarely pointed out 
          that Wallace also felt Malthusian logic was correct only so far as it 
          went. In an interview printed in 1912 (<a href="S750.htm">S750</a>) 
          he states (pp. 662-663): &quot;The theory propounded by Malthus is the greatest 
          of all delusions. As man develops towards a higher type; as he becomes 
          more refined and more civilised, so his fecundity decreases. Low down 
          in the scale of life, birth is only limited by available sustenance. 
          But the higher grows the type, the less is the fecundity. This is true, 
          not only of ascending types in the evolutionary scale, but it is also 
          true of ascending man. The fecundity of the slums is much greater than 
          that of Mayfair. As man progresses in comfort and refinement, he tends 
          to have fewer progeny; as witness the millions of India and China, compared 
          with the almost stationary population of England, and the declining 
          native population of France. Besides, if young people continued at school 
          until the age of twenty-five, early marriages would be discountenanced, 
          for public opinion would not tolerate marriage during the educational 
          period.&quot; This initially puzzling criticism is explainable as follows. 
          Wallace is not expressing discontent with the basic Malthusian position, 
          but instead (1) is decrying the way it has been applied in directions 
          (especially eugenics) he disapproves of, and (2) is expressing his belief 
          that Malthus did not identify all the relevant controls on human populations. 
          With regard to the second point, Malthus did in fact identify some of 
          the extenuating circumstances Wallace mentions above, but it must always 
          be remembered that by this point in his life Wallace had believed for 
          going on fifty years that causal agencies eminating from beyond physically-extended nature were additionally 
          influencing the way people cope with their situations, especially as 
          regards their ability to morally and ethically distinguish their proper 
          way. Otherwise put, a more &quot;refined&quot; individual is not merely being 
          &quot;checked&quot; in the Malthusian sense, but making considered choices destined 
          to promote a greater general good.

		      <a name="pathbb" id="pathbb"></a><i>Question: What were Wallace's &quot;three stages in the development of the living universe&quot;?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> In his later years Wallace came to the conclusion that &quot;there were three stages in the development of the living universe, at each of which there was an influx of something that was not there before&quot; (<a href="S738.htm">S738</a>, p. 122). On page 475 of <a href="S724CH15.htm">Chapter 15 of <em>Darwinism</em></a> he itemizes these as: &quot;The first stage is the change from inorganic to organic, when the earliest vegetable cell, or the living protoplasm out of which it arose, first appeared . . . The next stage is still more marvelous . . . It is the introduction of sensation or consciousness, constituting the fundamental distinction between the animal and vegetable kingdoms . . . The third stage is, as we have seen, the existence in man of a number of his most characteristic and noblest faculties, those which raise him furthest above the brutes and open up possibilities of almost indefinite advancement.&quot; He also discusses this matter on page 177 of <a href="S741.htm">S741</a> in 1903, and page 23 of <a href="S649.htm">S649</a> in 1908.

          <a name="pathc" id="pathc"></a><i>Question: Was Wallace really an anti-vaccinationist, and if so, 
          why?</i>
      </p><p> <i>Answer:</i> Wallace was indeed a full-blown anti-vaccinationist,
         coming to this position in the very late 1870s or early 1880s on the
        basis  of his examination of reports involving both anecdotal and statistical
         evidence. It is important to note, however, that he never believed--as
         has been commonly reported--vaccination to have been wholly hurtful
        historically.  Rather, his argument was that whatever the level of success
        it may have  had in stemming the tide of smallpox in the first half of
        the nineteenth  century (and he wasn't at all sure it had had much),
        by the latter part of that century unsanitary vaccine production and
        administration techniques, wholesale vaccination efforts, and a general
        improvement in societal sanitation and hygiene were making its mandatory
        application no longer advisable. Thus, on page 160 of <a href="S374-509.htm">S509</a> 
        (published in 1895) he says: &quot;. . . This clearly means, not that 'Vaccination
         may have caused more deaths than smallpox' . . . but that at the <i>present
          time</i>, as the result of general Vaccination for about fifty years,
           it may <i>now</i> be the cause of more deaths than smallpox&quot; [Wallace's
            italics]. So, simply put, he felt that at that point vaccination
           was doing  no more good than harm. Wallace's claim was never in fact
           debunked, though  by the time mandatory vaccination was finally done
           away with in England  the matter may well have been moot, as vaccine
           production and administration  techniques had been greatly improved.
           Wallace deserves a lot more credit  than he has received for being
           one of the true pioneers of statistical  epidemiology. For more information,
           see Wallace's <i>My Life</i> (S729), 
        Clements (1983), Scarpelli (1985), Fichman (2004 &amp; 2008),  Fichman 
        &amp; Keelan (2007), and Weber (2010).

          <a name="path1" id="path1"></a><i>Question: Did Wallace really become &quot;the forgotten 
          man&quot; when Darwin published his <u>On the Origin of Species</u>?</i> 
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> Hardly! When Wallace returned to England from his travels
         in the East in 1862, two and one half years after Darwin's book was
        published,  his role in the completion of that work was already known
        to naturalists;  by that point, moreover, he had attained an enviable
        reputation as a collector  and observer. His writings on a variety of
        subjects (in both the natural  and social sciences) soon brought him
        to the attention of a wider public  and professional audience. By the
        early twentieth century (years after  Darwin's death in 1882) he certainly
        ranked among the world's most famous  naturalists. At the time of his
        death in 1913, in fact, he may well have  been the most famous scientist
        in the world--I have in my possession copies  of contemporary interviews,
        obituaries, and other accounts that refer  to him in the following glowing
        terms: &quot;England's greatest living naturalist&quot; 
        (1886); &quot;perhaps the most eminent English man of science now living&quot;
        (1898); &quot;foremost naturalist of the age&quot; (1899); &quot;the
        acknowledged dean of the world's scientists&quot; (1902); &quot;[one
         of the two] most important and significant figures of the nineteenth
        century&quot; 
        (1904); &quot;the veteran leader of living scientists&quot; (1908); &quot;the greatest
        scientist of the age&quot; (1909); &quot;a
        mid-Victorian giant&quot; (1909); &quot;the greatest living representative of many
        famous men&quot; (1910); &quot;one of the greatest thinkers&quot; (1909); &quot;this
        greatest living representative of the Victorians&quot; (1910); &quot;the Grand
        Old Man of Science&quot; (1911,
        1913, 1913); &quot;the last of the great Victorians&quot; (1912); &quot;the last of
        that great breed of men with whose names the glory of the Victorian era
          is inseparably  bound up&quot; (1913); &quot;one of the greatest naturalists
          of the nineteenth century&quot; 
        (1913); &quot;We should not know where to look among the world's greatest
        men  for a figure more worthy to be called unique&quot; (1913); &quot;Of all the
        great  men of his time, or times, he was, with the single exception of
        Huxley,  the most human&quot; (1913); &quot;Only a great ruler could have been
        accorded by  the press of the world any such elaborate obituary recognition
        as was  evoked by the death of Alfred Russel Wallace&quot; (1914); &quot;the last
        of the  giants of English nineteenth-century science&quot; (1914)--and so
        on. After  his death, however, he soon fell into what might be termed &quot;relative
        obscurity,&quot; 
        and the road back has been slow.

          <a name="path2" id="path2"></a><i>Question: Did Wallace really, as some claim, 
          &quot;scoop&quot; Darwin on the theory of natural selection?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> No. While Wallace had been thinking in <i>evolutionary</i> 
        terms for many years--in fact, one might reasonably argue (because of 
        his very early interest in social evolution), for as long as Darwin had--the 
        <i>natural selection</i> concept in particular did not occur to him until 
        1858, by which time Darwin had been studying the idea for some twenty 
        years. Wallace's 1855 paper 'On the Law Which Has Regulated the Introduction 
        of New Species' (<a href="bib1.htm#zS020">S20</a>), which hinted strongly 
        at an evolutionary position, nevertheless contains not even a trace of 
        natural selection-like thinking. Moreover . . . True, Darwin had published 
        nothing concerning natural selection by the time he received Wallace's 
        essay 'On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original 
        Type' (<a href="bib1.htm#zS043">S43</a>) in mid-1858--and true, Darwin's 
        contribution to the 1 July 1858 introduction of natural selection to the 
        Linnean Society consisted only of two unpublished writings--but it must 
        be remembered that Wallace's essay itself was also an &quot;unpublished writing,&quot; 
        and that he had not asked Darwin to submit it for publication. Thus, the 
        overall presentation consisted of <i>three</i> unpublished, unintended-for-publication 
        writings, and it cannot be claimed even technically that &quot;Wallace got 
        into print with a finished work&quot; on natural selection before Darwin did. 
        In fact, Wallace's first natural selection-related analysis (that he <i>did</i> 
        intend for publication, that is!) did not appear until late 1863, a whole 
        four years after <i>On the Origin of Species</i> was published.

          <a name="path3" id="path3"></a><i>Question: Did Darwin really steal material from 
          Wallace to complete his theory of natural selection?</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Answer:</i> Maybe, though the evidence is something short of compelling.
         It has been suggested by Brackman (1980) and Brooks (1984) that Darwin
         might have received Wallace's communication in May or early June of
        1858  rather than in the middle of June of that same year, and that Darwin
        may  have spent the extra month using Wallace's model of species divergence
         to complete his own ideas on the subject before soliciting the opinions
         of his friends Hooker and Lyell on how to deal with the priority issue.
         Possibly so, but despite the best efforts of Brooks (1984) in particular,
         most observers remain unconvinced. A  book by Davies (2008) presents
         new evidence supporting the suspicion that Darwin really did receive
        Wallace's communication in 1858 earlier than has been thought (Davies
        also presents some other arguments), but more recent work by John van Wyhe and Kees Rookmaaker (2012) argues the opposite,  that Wallace's communication arrived at the later date. Nevertheless, the situation is still very much up in the air, and it is difficult to judge just how much Darwin's thoughts might have been influenced over the seventeen month period between his reception of Wallace's materials and his own writing up and release of <em>On the Origin of Species</em>
        in November 1859. See additional analysis by Beddall (1988), Berry (2002), Davies (2012, 2013), C. Smith (2013, 2014, 2014, 2015, 2016), Smth <i>et al.</i> (2020), and van Wyhe (2013). 
      My essays show that there is good reason to seriously question van Wyhe's conclusion that Wallace's Ternate essay was mailed in April 1858 (instead of March); much evidence goes against that conclusion.</p><p>

          as being Wallace's &quot;mentor.&quot; Does this word accurately reflect the nature 
          of their relationship?</i></p><p><i>Answer:</i> I think not. It would probably be more accurate to describe 
          Darwin as being Wallace's &quot;colleague&quot; and &quot;inspiration.&quot; Although Wallace 
          had for many years been aware of (and admired) Darwin's book on the 
          latter's around-the-world <i>H.M.S. Beagle</i> travels, the two had 
          met only once (and quite briefly at that) before Wallace's return to 
          England in 1862 from the Malay Archipelago. They had, however, struck 
          up a professional correspondence in the two years preceding Wallace's 
          discovery of natural selection in 1858, and Wallace knew that Darwin 
          was generally interested in &quot;the species question.&quot; After 1862, when 
          they had gotten to know one another personally, the relationship in 
          both directions was of friend and colleague (regardless of Darwin's 
          greater age). Certainly, there can be no doubt that Wallace had the 
          highest regard for Darwin's creative and intellectual faculties, but 
          this did not stop Wallace from disagreeing with him whenever he saw 
          fit. Neither did such disagreements stop Wallace from publicly defending 
          Darwin's theories and ideas on many occasions nor, indeed, did they 
          stop Darwin from turning to Wallace for advice or assistance on many 
          occasions. Wallace continued to defend Darwin's ideas long after the 
          latter's death; but he also continued to disagree with him on a number 
          of points.</p><p>

          <a name="path5" id="path5"></a><i>Question: Can Wallace's embrace of spiritualism 
          be attributed to a disillusionment with Owenist (i.e., the utopian socialist 
          Robert Owen) ideals, as has sometimes been suggested?</i>
         
      </p>
          <p><i>Answer:</i> This seems most unlikely to me--at least as expressed 
        so simplistically. To begin with, it must be remembered that Wallace did 
        not even become a full convert to socialism until 1889--some twenty years 
        <i>after</i> his adoption of spiritualism--with his reading of Edward 
        Bellamy's utopian novel <i>Looking Backward</i>. One can actually make 
        a much better case regarding the reverse association: that Wallace may 
        have given up on trying to interest his colleagues in investigating spiritualism, 
        and that this helped lead him toward socialism. The argument here is reasonably 
        straightforward, and is easily documented: using subject data pulled from 
        my OUP study on Wallace's writings (Smith 1991), one finds that Wallace 
        published only three socialism-related works before 1890 but 26 afterwards, 
        whereas the parallel figures for his works on spiritualism total 45 and 
        51, respectively. My reading of the situation is that Wallace came to 
        realize by the late-1870s, perhaps, that his efforts to promote spiritualism 
        were somewhat premature (actually, a case of trying to &quot;put the cart before 
        the horse&quot;): that is, that it made more sense to work first for societal 
        level changes that would reduce the levels of stress on the ordinary person, 
        thereby freeing hi/r to spend more time exploring self-improvement vehicles 
        such as spiritualism. The essence of this strategy is conveyed in his 
        address 'Spiritualism and Social Duty' (<a href="bib3.htm#zS545">S545</a>), 
        delivered in 1898, and the essay 'True Individualism' (<a href="S587.htm">S587</a>), 
        published in 1900 in his <i>Studies Scientific and Social</i> (S727). 
        The first work, in particular, makes it clear that as of that date he 
        was paying more attention to the promotion of socialism than he was to 
        spiritualism, hardly what one would expect from a &quot;disillusioned Owenist.&quot; 
        And Wallace was still writing in glowing terms of Owen's work well into 
        his eighties: there is nearly a whole chapter on his self-described &quot;debt&quot; 
        to Owen in his 1905 autobiography <i>My Life</i> (S729),  and an essay on Owen's relevance to educational reform (<a href="S618C.htm">S618c</a>), published the same year. 
        But there remains a complication. Although Wallace had admired Owen's 
        utopian brand of socialism from an early age, there is good evidence (see, 
        for example, <a href="S431.htm">S431</a> &amp; S729, Vol. 2, p. 266) that 
        for many years he regarded it as both impracticable and perhaps to some 
        degree contrary to his (Wallace's) personal views on the protection of 
        individual rights and freedoms. I rather doubt, however, that these weaknesses 
        as he perceived them at that time in any sense &quot;drove&quot; him to spiritualism 
        (see my essay <a href="../essays/ARWPAMPH.htm" target="_blank">'Alfred 
        Russel Wallace on Spiritualism, Man, and Evolution'</a> and monograph 
        <i><a href="chsarwp.htm" target="_parent">Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution 
        of an Evolutionist</a></i>); instead, they merely caused him to ignore 
        socialism for the time being--that is, until 1889 and his reading of the 
        Bellamy work. See also my second essay in Smith &amp; Beccaloni (2008).

          <a name="path6" id="path6"></a><i>Question: Did Wallace come to reject natural 
          selection when he became a spiritualist?</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Answer:</i> No, he did not. Actually, just about everyone agrees that 
        he didn't reject it <i>entirely</i> when he became a spiritualist; the 
        real question is whether he changed his mind about its application to 
        the evolution of man. First, one should note that this supposed change 
        (more exactly, &quot;reversal&quot;) of mind, even if it did take place (I have my doubts), should not be construed 
        to have had anything to do with how he envisioned the basic physical aspects 
        of the evolution of humankind. In this respect he remained a true (materialist) 
        Darwinian to the end, never budging from the idea that humans had descended 
        from some ape-like ancestor in the remote past. There is still question, 
        however, as to whether between 1858 and 1869 (the dates, respectively, 
        of his Ternate essay on natural selection, and public embrace of spiritualism) 
        he may have reversed himself on whether natural selection could be 
        invoked to account for the evolution of humankind's higher moral and intellectual 
        faculties. Considerable analysis has been published on this particular 
        matter (see, for example, Smith 1972, Kottler 1974, Turner 1974, Schwartz 
        1984, and Malinchak 1987) and the arguments have gotten quite involved; 
        I personally feel that Wallace, who in his 1858 Ternate essay draft left 
        humankind out of the discussion, did so deliberately, and in fact had 
        no such &quot;reversal of mind.&quot; The reasons for reaching this conclusion are 
        given in my essays <a href="../essays/ARWPAMPH.htm" target="_blank">'Alfred 
        Russel Wallace on Spiritualism, Man and Evolution'</a> and <a href="../essays/WALLTALK.htm" target="_blank">'Alfred

        appreciation of what he stood for. Wallace, ever the defender of the rights 
        of the common man, would never have permitted himself to be knighted; 
        he was so adamant on this particular subject, in fact, that when at one 
        point a rumor began to circulate that he was about to be so honored, he 
        quickly published a letter in the magazine <i>Public Opinion</i> (<a href="S658.htm">S658</a>)

          was located at the center of the Universe, and that our planet was the 
          only one that hosted living things?</i>
      </p>
<p><i>Answer:</i> Yes, and no--that is, yes, he believed Earth is located 
        at or near the center of the Universe (though his exact opinions on this 
        matter changed as time went on), but no, he did not argue that we were 
        necessarily the only place in the cosmos where life existed. In Wallace's 
        time the Universe was not definitely known to extend beyond our own galaxy. 
        Wallace used a variety of contemporary sources of astronomical data to 
        come to the conclusion that our Sun is located at the center of the Milky 
        Way--an incorrect conclusion, of course--and that it was highly unlikely 
        that any other planet existed which harbored advanced life forms. He has 
        frequently been misunderstood on this latter point; most sources refer 
        to him as not believing in the likelihood of any kind of life existing 
        anywhere else. However, he himself once stated: &quot;I need hardly say, I 
        suppose, that I have never suggested that this earth alone in the whole 
        universe is the abode of life. What I do say is . . . that all the available 
        evidence supports the idea of the extreme unlikelihood of there being 
        on any star or planet revealed by the telescope--I won't say life, but 
        any intelligent being, either identical with or analogous to man&quot; (<a href="S741.htm">S741</a>, 
        p. 177). See Lane (2011), and the review of Wallace's anthropocentrism in Dick (2008) and R. Smith (2019).

          <a name="path9" id="path9"></a><i>Question: Was Wallace a Social Darwinist?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> This item falls into the general class of &quot;Are you still 
        beating your wife?&quot; questions. While it is certainly true that Wallace 
        was <i>in general</i> a Darwinist (to the extent that he believed in the 
        basic validity of the natural selection concept, and in many of the ways 
        it was applied by self-admitted &quot;Darwinists&quot;), he did not support naively 
        analogical applications of the notion of the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; 
        to social settings; thus, and in particular, most of the strategies devised 
        by leaders of the eugenics movement disgusted him (see <a href="S427.htm">S427</a>, 
        <a href="S549.htm">S549</a>, <a href="bib4.htm#zS733">S733</a>, <a href="S737.htm">S737</a> 
        &amp; <a href="S750.htm">S750</a>). Moreover, he hated &quot;might makes right&quot; 
        arguments (see <a href="S549.htm">S549</a>, <a href="S579.htm">S579</a> 
        &amp; <a href="S580.htm">S580</a>). Still, it is fair to think of him 
        as being an important (if not the <i>most</i> important) force in the 
        development of a socially-responsible kind of Darwinian thinking. His 
        own social applications of the natural selection concept were to such 
        subjects as female-based mate choice (see <a href="S427.htm">S427</a>, 
        <a href="S649.htm">S649</a>, <a href="bib4.htm#zS733">S733</a> &amp; <a href="S736.htm">S736</a>) 
        and education (see <a href="S445.htm">S445</a> &amp; <a href="S736.htm">S736</a>), 
        and featured thinking that was often antithetical to that of the main 
        school of Social Darwinists, led by Spencer and Galton. Wallace's ideas 
        in the &quot;social cooperation&quot; direction paralleled, and possibly influenced, 
        the development of the mutual aid concept promoted by the Russian geographer 
        and anarchist Petr Kropotkin. See related analysis by Young (1969), Bannister 
        (1970, 1979), Durant (1979), Jones (1980), Stepan (1982), Oates (1988), 
        Rayher (1996), Claeys (2000), Stack (2000, 2003 &amp; 2008), Levine (2002), 
        and Paul (2003, 2008).

          <a name="path10" id="path10"></a><i>Question: What is Wallace's Line?</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Answer:</i> Also known as &quot;The Wallace Line,&quot; this is an imaginary
         geographical feature trending the more or the less along the edge of
        the  Sunda Shelf in Indonesia (in other words, tracing the dividing line
        between  the shallow shelf waters to the west and deep ocean to the east).
        It extends  from between the islands of Bali and Lombok (in the Lesser
        Sundas) on  northward to between Borneo and Sulawesi, and from there continues
        northward to  separate the Philippine island of Mindanao from the small
        islands of Sangir  and Talaud that lie south of it. The significance
        of the line is that  it identifies a substantial (though not entirely
        abrupt) faunal discontinuity: many major groups found to the west of
        the line do not extend east of it, and <em>vice versa</em>. It thus represents
        a kind of geologically/physiographically-influenced 
        &quot;front&quot; of intermixture between two of the world's main faunal realms,
         the Oriental and the Australian. See <a href="S053.htm">S53</a>, <a href="S078.htm">S78</a>,

          <a name="path11" id="path11"></a><i>Question: What was the actual sequence of events 
          leading up to the 1 July 1858 Linnean Society reading of Wallace's and 
          Darwin's writings on natural selection?</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Answer:</i> There are still some unanswered questions here, but we 
        <i>think</i> we know at least the following. In February of 1858, while
         on the island of Ternate (or quite more likely on the nearby island
        of  Gilolo, as McKinney 1972 first claimed) suffering from a malarial
        episode,  Wallace conceived of the notion of natural selection. Within
        days, as  soon as he was well enough to make an extended effort, he completed
        setting  the idea down in essay form (<a href="bib1.htm#zS043">S43</a>).
        Shortly  thereafter he sent this, apparently with a cover letter, to
        Darwin (both  the letter and the original draft of the essay have been
        lost). Darwin,  he knew, was interested in the &quot;species question,&quot; and
        Wallace hoped he  would bring the work to the attention of his friend
        Sir Charles Lyell,  the famous geologist. Wallace did not ask for any
        assistance in getting  the paper published but, given the meagre evidence
        available, it seems  unlikely that he specifically asked that it <i>not</i> be
        published (actually a much more important matter, at least in terms of
        the progression of Wallace's thought to that point). Darwin possibly
        received the essay on 17 June 1858 (there is still some real question
        about this: see Brackman 1980, Brooks 1984, and Davies 2008), and immediately
        wrote a letter to Lyell expressing distress at the state of affairs (especially,
        as this represented a serious threat to his priority on the subject).
        Lyell then seems to have contacted Joseph Hooker, the botanist (and another
        of Darwin's close friends), and the two came up with a workable solution:
        they would arrange to have Wallace's essay and some representative writings
        of Darwin's read as a joint contribution at the next meeting of the Linnean
        Society. Darwin chose two fragments from writings he had composed some
        time before; neither of these had been intended for publication. The
        next meeting of the Society happened to be a specially scheduled one;
        it was held on 1 July 1858. Darwin did not attend the meeting (and, of
        course, neither did Wallace). Wallace first found out about what has
        been referred to as the &quot;delicate
        arrangement&quot; 
        from letters Darwin and Hooker sent to him after the fact. See analysis
         by McKinney (1966), Moody (1971), Brackman (1980), Brooks (1984), Beddall
         (1988), Gardiner (1995), Stevens (1995), England (1997), Dawkins (2002), Davies (2008 &amp; 2012), Gonz&aacute;lez Recio (2010), Smith (2013, 2014 &amp; 2015), Van Wyhe &amp; Rookmaaker (2012), and Partridge (2015, 2020).

          <a name="path12" id="path12"></a><i>Question: Did Wallace resent the treatment he 
          received vis-a-vis the &quot;delicate arrangement&quot; of 1858?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> Wallace never publicly expressed any annoyance over the
         situation, nor, as far as we know, did he ever say anything derogatory
         in private. Indeed, on a number of occasions (for example, <a href="S599.htm">S599</a>, 
        <a href="S656.htm">S656</a>, <a href="bib4.htm#zS726">S726</a>, <a href="bib4.htm#zS729">S729</a> 
        &amp; <a href="S743.htm">S743</a>) he indicated that he felt Darwin's
         much longer attention to the problem more than spoke for his priority
         on the matter. Still, there remain good reasons for certain doubts on
        this score. To begin with, Wallace was a gentleman, and would have considered
        public complaining unseemly behavior (some may consider this a dubious
        remark, but it has often been noted how there is scarcely, if any, a
        word in all of Wallace's voluminous public and private writings that
        anyone might regard as shameful or personally embarrassing). Moreover,
        he certainly would have realized by, say, 1860, that he was destined
        to become one of history's noteworthies, and that even his private writings
        might someday be scrutinized for such commentary. And, in the more immediate
        sense,  he seemingly had every reason to be thankful for what had happened:
        the  chain of events leading to the reading of his paper had made him
        famous,  ushering his entry into the highest echelons of scientific society.
        As  a result, he surely would have been viewed as ungrateful had he suddenly
         presented a challenge. Besides, Darwin really <i>had</i> in fact been
          studying the idea for going on twenty years, lack of publication notwithstanding.
          Also, were Wallace to have spoken up on the matter the act would have
          detracted from the development of the theory itself, something he clearly
          would not have wanted. Each of these considerations individually may
         well  have struck him as a good enough reason to keep silent on the
         matter,  but, taken in combination, what outcome should anyone have
         expected? Note,  however, that Wallace may have left behind at least
         one indication that  he was not entirely satisfied with the way things
         turned out. On no fewer  than <i>five</i> different future occasions
         he drew special attention--in  <em>published works</em>, yet (S43,
         in the 1870 German reprint; <a href="S516.htm">S516</a>; 
        <a href="S599.htm">S599</a>; S725, p. 27; and S729, Vol. 1, p. 363 )--to
         the fact that he had not had any final say on the fate of his 1858 Ternate
         essay. Considering its great success, this is a bit strange. I draw
        from  this persistence on his part an inference: that there was something
        about  the essay itself, or its handling, or both, that he regretted.
        I vote  for the essay itself: given his lack of request that it might
        be published, perhaps it was really more tentative in some regards than
        he later let on to. For further discussion see my monograph <i><a href="chsarwp.htm" target="_parent">Alfred
         Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist</a></i>.

          <a name="path13" id="path13"></a><i>Question: Were Wallace and Darwin really on 
          friendly professional and personal terms?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> Yes, though it is quite likely that Wallace--how shall
         we say it--&quot;worried Darwin a little.&quot; All of their correspondence and
          such other evidence as exists suggests that they truly were on friendly
          (though certainly not &quot;bosom buddy&quot;) personal terms. There can also
           be no doubt that the two men recognized and respected each other as
           major creative and intellectual forces. But they did often disagree
           on how to apply their ideas to specific problems, and such disagreements
           seemed to trouble Darwin more than they did Wallace. I surmise (especially
           from his correspondence) that Darwin came to regard Wallace as being
           something of a &quot;loose cannon&quot; at times, and the latter's attachment
            to spiritualism and various radical social causes undoubtedly did
           little  to soften the former's opinion. Yet Darwin continued to seek
           Wallace's assistance and advice and to compliment him on his various
           writings until Darwin's death in 1882, and to an extent that surely
           extended beyond mere politeness.

          <a name="path14" id="path14"></a><i>Question: Were Wallace's attempts at social 
          criticism really faddist and inconsequential, as some have implied?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> No, and no. Slowly but surely we are coming to appreciate
         the significant extent to which many of Wallace's efforts both presaged
         and contributed to the general &quot;Liberal Agenda&quot; of the twentieth century.
          One should not view his endeavors in this direction as a hobby or of
         secondary  importance to him; after about 1878, in fact, his writings
         on social science  subjects were about as numerous as those he published
         on natural science  subjects. And he clearly took his social theorizing
         very seriously, in  more than one instance coming right out in print
         that he felt the fight  for personal freedoms took precedence over the
         study of science (see,  for example, <a href="S157.htm">S157</a>, <a href="S158.htm">S158</a> 
        &amp; <a href="S420.htm">S420</a>). As to whether the causes he chose were faddist, one can
        only  point out that a good number of them: (1) concerned issues that
        remain  hotly debated (for example, the excesses of eugenics, the negative
        results  of militarism and imperialism, the earnings gap between the
        rich and the  poor, and the legislation of guaranteed social welfare
        and education programs);  (2) were later resolved through popular opinion
        shifts and legislative  acts (mandatory vaccination, the practice of
        large land-holding, and the  structure of the House of Lords); or (3)
        foretold future thinking (the  Russian &quot;synthetic school&quot; of epidemiology,
        the advantages of a paper money standard, the nationalization of transportation
        systems, employee buy-outs of companies, suburbanization and the creation
        of greenbelts and parks, paying special higher rates for overtime work,
        etc.). Among those individuals who at one time or another expressed an
        interest in or praise for Wallace's efforts in the social arena are some
        important historical figures: John Stuart Mill, Lester Ward, Sun Yat-sen,
        Clarence Darrow, Irving Fisher, G. K. Chesterton, Petr Kropotkin, Henry
        George, Leland Stanford, Ebenezer Howard, Charles Peirce, and John Wesley
        Powell, to name a few. The possible connections between Wallace and the
        work of Sun, Kropotkin, Howard, and Peirce in particular appear especially
        intriguing, and would seem to merit more attention than they have heretofore
        been given. See analysis by Fisher (1920), Durant (1979), Jones (1980),
        Kubota (1980), Clements (1983), Silagi (1989), Degler (1991), Andelson
        (1993), Kogan (1994), Gaffney (1997), Blinderman (1998), Gould (1998),
        Coleman (1999), Stack (2000, 2003), Fichman (2004), Paul (2003), Smith
        (2003), Smith &amp; Beccaloni (2008), Hale (2010),  Lowrey (2010), and Green (2012).

          <a name="path15" id="path15"></a><i>Question: Was Wallace a &quot;follower&quot; of Henry 
          George, the American economist and land reformer?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> Yes and no. To the extent that both Wallace and George 
        concerned themselves with injustices stemming from the characteristics 
        of land ownership, and believed that the system of landlordism in effect 
        was an important contributor to these injustices, they followed parallel 
        paths. It is clear, however, that once Wallace became aware of George's 
        writings (especially the latter's 1879 book <i>Progress and Poverty</i>), 
        he borrowed heavily from them. Still, most of what he borrowed actually 
        consisted of George's examples rather than the latter's posed solution 
        to the problem, which was quite different from Wallace's: George supported 
        the famous &quot;single tax&quot; approach, whereas Wallace and his Land Nationalisation 
        Society promoted a plan of State-owned and -leased lands. Wallace's own 
        influence on George was substantial, but more in the area of promotion: 
        he was one of George's first outspoken supporters, gaining him much attention, 
        and the ranks of Wallace's Land Nationalisation Society itself supplied 
        many individuals who would later immerse themselves in Georgist activities.

          <a name="path16" id="path16"></a><i>Question: Why do many of today's biogeographers 
          reject some of Wallace's most famous ideas on biogeography?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> In part because of important new discoveries in the earth
         sciences, and in part because of new approaches to systematics and the
         goals of biogeographic explanation. In Wallace's time the characteristics
         of organic distribution were thought to be linked largely to <i>vertical</i> 
        movements in the earth's crust; that is, to whether elevation or lowering
         of the land or sea had resulted in connections being made where once
        they  did not exist (or <i>vice versa</i>), and how this might affect
        the dispersal  and evolution of species. The notion that <i>horizontal</i> movements
         (plate tectonics-based ocean-floor spreading and continental drift)
        of  the crust might also take place was quite beyond the level of discussion;
         thus, Wallace's understanding that the ocean basins and continental
        masses  were more or less permanent features, while satisfactorily addressing
         the issues of his day, has since been superseded by a more complete
        model  of surface evolution. Further, the nineteenth century notion that
        dispersal  into new areas followed by differentiation in place constitutes
        the primary  evolutionary process has come into dispute, and along with
        it, the explanatory  value of the classic faunal regions-based approach.
        A more scientific  appraisal of the history and geography of species
        divergence has been  achieved through what is known as vicariance biogeography,
        which, ironically,  focuses on some of the same questions as are treated
        in Wallace's first  essay on biogeography of 1855 (<a href="bib1.htm#zS020">S20</a>).
        Michaux  (1991) has even gone so far as to state: &quot;Indeed, rather than
        being regarded  as the founder of 'dispersalist biogeography,' a case
        could be made that  he was a forerunner of modern biogeographic theories
        that use the idea  of geological change as an explanatory principle.&quot; For

          <a name="path17" id="path17"></a><i>Question: Was Wallace a Creationist, as some 
          have implied?</i> 
      </p>
      <p><i>Answer:</i> Wallace spent most of his early days as an agnostic, but 
        it appears that his broadening slant on things natural and social instilled 
        in him a sense that there was, after all, something resembling a hierarchy 
        of causal forces in the universe--a hierarchy extending beyond the physical, 
        moreover, and into the realm of spirits and altogether unimaginable higher 
        beings. But he would have nothing of a God who directly and individually 
        manipulated the affairs of individual beings, and had equally little enthusiasm 
        for organized religious belief. Wallace's was a universe operating under 
        final, not first, causes: such influence as any conceivable &quot;higher beings&quot; 
        might have on lower beings was transmitted through the operation of natural 
        laws, just as any other kind of natural process might take place. Wallace's 
        spiritualism was thus a manifestation of his naturalism, and not of any 
        religious belief. He rarely spoke even metaphorically of God, but in so doing 
        he was doing <i>literally</i> just that: speaking metaphorically. When he used the term &quot;God&quot; in his writings, this almost invariably  involved some kind of effort to describe the thoughts of others. For 
        further discussion see my monograph <i><a href="chsarwp.htm" target="_parent">Alfred 
        Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist</a></i>. Also note Wallace's 
        comments <a href="S716note.htm">here</a>.

          <a name="path98" id="path98"></a><i>Question: Was Wallace's memory as bad as some sources have made out?</i> 
      </p>
      <p><i>Answer:</i> Autobiographical memory is usually characterized as having two main components. The first concerns the ability to remember the qualities and details of objects, places, and events. In this respect, Wallace seems to have had a very sharp memory, right up to his last days. Various individuals from his own time commented on this, and the detail committed to many subjects in his writings attests to this. The other element of autobiographical memory is the ability to place events along a specific timeline, or to remember specific names or the places where events took place: that is, an ability to attach secondary labels to things. In this second ability Wallace was not so good; as a result his writings contain many errors of mis-dating, mis-placing, and mis-naming. See my <i>Alfred Russel Wallace Notes</i> No. 12.

          Wallace and Darwin disagreed?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> While Wallace and Darwin agreed on most of the basic
        premises  of the subjects they studied, Wallace was never afraid to disagree
        with  his older colleague when he saw fit to do so. There are several
        main issues  on which they differed (for discussion see the writings
        cited): (1) the  extent to which natural selection could explain the
        development of humankind's  higher moral and intellectual faculties (<a href="S146.htm">S146</a>,

         of  acquired characters (<a href="S311.htm">S311</a>, <a href="S394.htm">S394</a>,

         1916); and (7) selection for reproductive isolation (<a href="bib4.htm#zS724">S724</a>;

           2000, Ollerton 2005, Johnson 2008). Wallace discusses these issues
          in  some detail in Volume 2 of <i>My Life</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS729">S729</a>),
           on pages 16-22.

          <a name="path19" id="path19"></a><i>Question: Just how similar were Wallace's and 
          Darwin's ideas on evolution, as distinct from natural selection?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> Probably not nearly as similar as many observers seem 
        to think. Darwin looked at evolution in purely material terms, effectively 
        restricting the concept to the irreversible changes that have occurred 
        in life over significant periods of time. Natural selection, he felt, 
        was the main process driving this change, but admitted that other forces 
        (for example, the inheritance of acquired characters) might well be influencing 
        its direction in addition. Wallace, by contrast, regarded natural selection 
        not as a process, but as a law akin to Newtonian gravitation: tellingly, 
        in <i>The Wonderful Century</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS726">S726</a>) he 
        says: &quot;. . . the establishment of the general theory of evolution, by 
        means of the special theory of the development of the organic world through 
        the struggle for existence and its necessary outcome, Natural Selection.&quot; 
        Thus, we have the notion that the removal of the unfit was the necessary 
        <i>result</i> of the struggle for existence. Unlike Darwin, Wallace believed 
        that the biological aspect of evolution, at least, was entirely &quot;ruled&quot; 
        (his word) by the operation of natural selection, an understanding that 
        has brought him criticism as a &quot;hyperselectionist&quot; or &quot;panselectionist&quot; 
        (hyperselectionism as portrayed by Gould 1980 concerns the idea that &quot;every 
        part of every creature is fashioned for and only for its immediate use&quot;; 
        the closely related &quot;panselectionism&quot; has been defined by John S. Wilkins 
        as &quot;the view that all characters of an organism have an adaptive reason 
        for evolving&quot;). Actually, however, this may be hollow criticism. To begin 
        with, it is almost always ignored that although Wallace did believe that 
        all population variation was acted upon by natural selection to produce 
        adaptations, he also regularly admitted that we knew next to nothing about 
        the causes of that variation, and that their enaction might well be influencing 
        what was there to be selected! Again, he appears to have conceived natural 
        selection (and the suite of adaptations thus produced) as the ongoing 
        <i>result</i> of the struggle for existence, and not the overall process 
        of evolution itself. From this we might conclude something rather interesting: 
        that Wallace viewed the process of adaptation in what we might now label 
        negative feedback terms; i.e., that the continuous production of new adaptations 
        served to conserve entropy between the organism and its shifting surroundings, 
        while the positive feedback part of the process--the entering into new 
        ecological associations through movement, range change, behavioral and 
        conscious-decision making, etc.--served ultimately to &quot;accumulate&quot; (one 
        of his favorite words) negentropy. If this is essentially true, Wallace's 
        panselectionism makes more sense, because it implies a necessary connection 
        not between adaptive process and <i>specific</i> adaptive result, but 
        instead between natural biological and/or physical forcing functions and <i>some kind of</i> 
        adaptive result (a distinctly biogeographic way of conceiving the process, 
        one should note). It might be added that this appreciation is certainly 
        more in keeping both with his predisposition toward final causes and progressive 
        change, and with his early observations on the apparent lack of connection 
        between phylogenetic relation and adaptation to ecological station. For 
        further discussion see Smith (<a href="http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/essays/SMITH89.htm">1989</a>,

          <a name="path20" id="path20"></a><i>Question: How does one reconcile Wallace's apparent 
          respect for native peoples with his sometimes stated position that the 
          European powers were &quot;superior&quot; to them?</i>
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> Easily, actually, though his position has frequently
        been  manipulated by later workers to suit the needs of various preconceived
         arguments. There can be no doubt that Wallace not only respected societally
         more primitive (that is, as compared with the technologically more sophisticated
         Western Europeans) peoples, but believed them to be, on the average,
        quite  on a par morally and ethically with Westerners. Nevertheless,
        he recognized  that Westerners were certainly &quot;superior,&quot; if only to
        the extent that  they were capable of militarily and culturally overwhelming &quot;less
        advanced&quot; 
        societies (and indeed often did). Thus, he was not relaying a &quot;might
        makes  right&quot; kind of thinking, but instead a simple factual assessment
        of the  power structure involved. Consider Wallace's reply to a question
        posed  about his famous 1864 essay 'The Origin of Human Races and the
        Antiquity  of Man . . .' (<a href="bib1.htm#zS093">S93</a>, p. clxxxiii): &quot;Now,
        it  appears to me that the mere fact of one race supplanting another
        proves  their superiority. It is not a question of intellect only, nor
        of bodily  strength only. We cannot tell what causes may produce it .
        . . But still  there is the plain fact that two races come into contact,
        and that one  drives out the other. This is a proof that the one race
        is better fitted  to live upon the world than the other.&quot; Gould (1980,
        pp. 36-37) states  that Wallace &quot;was an ardent cultural chauvinist who
        never doubted the  evident superiority of European ways&quot; and that with
        respect to savages, 
        &quot;he certainly had a low opinion of their life.&quot; Wallace's own writings
         do not support these claims. In <i>My Life</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS729">S729</a>,
          Vol. 1, p. 288) Wallace describes as one of the highlights of his life
          his first meeting with a truly unspoiled Amazon Indian: &quot;. . . they
          walked  with the free step of the independent forest-dweller . . .
          in every detail  they were original and self-sustaining as are the
          wild animals of the  forests, absolutely independent of civilization
          . . . the true denizen  of the Amazonian forests, like the forest itself,
          is unique and not to  be forgotten.&quot; There is also the famous remark
          made in a letter sent home in 1855 (<a href="S022.htm">S22</a>): &quot;The
          more I see of uncivilized people, the better I think of human nature
          on the whole, and the essential differences between so-called civilized
          and savage man seem to disappear&quot; and &quot;For nearly twelve years I travelled and lived mostly among uncivilised or completely savage races, and I became convinced that they all possessed good qualities, some of them in a very remarkable degree, and that in all the great characteristics of humanity they are wonderfully like ourselves,&quot; from a 1906 essay (<a href="S630.htm">S630</a>). I don't see how his anecdotal reporting that many savages were unpracticed
         in higher mathematics, had a simple language, etc., etc. can reasonably
         be construed as indicating his &quot;low opinion of their life,&quot; when in
         dozens  of other places throughout his writings he praises their ingenuity
         and  moral fibre. Further, if Wallace was indeed such a &quot;cultural chauvinist,&quot; 
        why did he invest so much time in local radical causes, combating an
        English social system he characterized as being &quot;rotten at the core&quot; in
        his essay 'Human Selection' (<a href="S427.htm">S427</a>)? Wallace may
        well have underestimated the actual complexity of uncivilized cultures
        in many instances, but I find it difficult to concede that he ever underestimated
        their basic humanity. See Tsao (2010) for an excellent analysis of this
        matter.

<a name="Welsh" id="Welsh"></a><i>Question: Was Wallace actually 
            a Welshman, as seems to be increasingly claimed?</i> 
      </p><p><i>Answer:</i> Several people have criticized me for not giving Wales
         its just due with regard to Wallace's national affinities. I think the
         Welsh claim on him is rather tenuous, but here are the facts (at least
         those given in Wallace's autobiography <i>My Life</i>, <a href="bib4.htm#zS729">S729</a>),
          so you decide. Wallace's mother was of long-term English descent; his
          father probably was too (Wallace accepts that his father's line was
         of  Scottish origin, though this certainly had not been of recent derivation,
          and as likely as not constituted a rather distant affinity). They had
          moved from St. George's, Southwark, to the small town of Usk about
         1820,  probably for financial reasons (possibly either because it cost
         less to  live there, or to avoid creditors, or both). At that time Usk
         was part  of the area known as Monmouthshire, at least in some respects
         an administrative  division of England. However, this region, going
         back to ancient times,  had originally been known as Gwent, culturally
         and politically part of  Wales. Many years later (after Wallace's birth,
         that is), in 1974, the  region was fully &quot;returned&quot; to Wales, again
         with the name Gwent (more  recently, the name Monmouthshire has been
         reinstated). Wallace himself  was born in Usk in 1823, but it is clear
         from <i>My Life</i> that he and 
        his family felt like, and were made to feel like, outsiders there. In
          1828 or possibly early 1829, when he was just five or six, the
         family moved again, this time back over to England, to the town of Hertford
         (a relative had died there in 1828, freeing up an inexpensive place
         to lodge). Father, mother and children never returned to Wales to live
         as a family during the children's adolescent years. Wallace did however
         work in Wales for two three-year periods (1840-1843 and 1845-1848) during
         the time he was employed as a journeyman surveyor (first, for his older
         brother, and later,  to wrap up and continue that brother's business
         after he died). An essay he wrote on Welsh farmers (<a href="S623.htm">S623</a>)
         during that period is at points nearly cruelly harsh on them.
         In later life Wallace visited Wales only on a few short occasions (vacations
         and lectures); he also concerned himself with the social and economic
         problems of the Welsh a good deal less than he did with those of the
         English, Irish, and Scots. My personal view of all this is that given
         the Wallace family's heritage and relatively short period of residence
         in Wales--not to mention the Monmouthshire technicality--Wallace can
         hardly be considered a Welshman (though it is clear enough that Wales
         figured importantly in several respects in his early life, a fact that
         should not be underestimated). Apparently Wallace himself agreed: although
         on many occasions he drew attention to his ancestral connections with
         the Scots, to my knowledge he never once referred to himself as a Welshman,<font color="ff3300">*</font> and
         indeed  always named his place of birth as &quot;Monmouthshire,&quot; not &quot;Gwent.&quot; 
        Further, his contemporaries just about always referred to him as an Englishman.
         It is on record, moreover, that in late life he <i>declined</i> the
         offer  of an honorary doctorate from the University of Wales--after
         years earlier  accepting ones from Dublin and Oxford--not exactly what
         one would expect  for a person feeling elemental ties to the region.
         To summarize: I would  be happy to consider Wallace in some sense &quot;Welsh&quot; were
         any  of the following true: (1) one or both of his parents had any substantial
          and reasonably recent Welsh heritage (2) Wallace had grown to adulthood
          there (i.e., without moving back to England for over ten years first,
         starting at the age of five or before) (3) his parents had remained
         in Wales permanently instead of moving back to England (4) Wallace had <i>voluntarily</i> moved
         back to Wales during his teen years or adulthood (i.e.,
         as opposed to being first dragged along by his brother, or later cleaning
         up his brother's affairs after he died) and then remained there (5)
         Wallace had settled in Wales permanently after his return from the Malay
         Archipelago in 1862 (6) Wallace had referred to himself as a Welshman
         (7) and perhaps, even, had Gwent always been unambiguously Welsh and
         continuously referred to by that name. However, none of these <i>are</i> true.
         Perhaps  he can most conservatively be referred to as &quot;an Englishman
         born in Wales.&quot;</p>
      <p><font color="ff3300" size="+2">*</font>As people continue to hound me on this point, 
        I let Wallace speak for himself on this matter; the following are short 
        quotations drawn from Wallace's own published writings (for the full contexts, 
        use <i>Google Books</i> to search for the first three quotations, and 
        my own site search engine here for the last three): &nbsp;&quot;...had 
        never been visited by an English collector...&quot; (speaking of himself, 
        in Vol. 1, p. 357, of <i>My Life</i>); &quot;...I was the only Englishman 
        who had lived some...&quot; (Vol. 2, p. 34, of <i>My Life</i>); &quot; 
        ...he's an Englishman, lecturing on biology and Darwin...&quot; (speaking 
        of someone talking about him, in Vol. 2, p. 122, of <i>My Life</i>); &quot;...What 
        most impresses the nature-loving Englishman while travelling in America...&quot; 
        (speaking of himself, on p. 532 of 'English and American Flowers'); &quot; 
        &quot;...I believe I am the only Englishman who has ever shot and skinned...&quot; 
        (from a letter from the field published in 1857); and &quot;...I claim 
        for every Englishman a share in this great property, devoted by <i>our</i> 
        ancestors to...&quot; (from an interview published in 1886--note the &quot;our,&quot; 
        with my italics). No such usages can be associated with the words Welshman, 
        Welsh, or Welshmen in any of Wallace's writings, to all of which I now have searchable electronic 
        access.</p>

<p align=justify>
PONG arcade machines started in late 1972 with Atari PONG which
had an immediate success, resulting in around 19,000 PONG machines
sold. Soon after PONG entered the one year old video game market,
numerous companies copied the game (an easy task as it was built
with simple electronic chips and a regular TV set). Atari's first
PONG license was sold to <b>Allied Leisure</b> who released the game
under the name of <b>Paddle Battle</b>. Because Allied Leisure
could not make the electronic boards, the company contracted
<b>Universal Research Labs</b> (URL) to manufacture the boards (early
Paddle Battle boards show an URL copyright). However, the competition
did not take long to get strong and one of its immediate effects were
the release of <b>Wimbledon</b> by <b>Nutting Associates</b> in early
1973, a four-player PONG game in color (this company released the
first successful arcade machine in 1971: <b>Computer Space</b>). Atari didn't
have enough time to release <b>PONG Doubles</b>, the equivalent in
black and white. Many companies released arcade PONG machines between
1973 and the late 1970s: Amutronics, Bally, Midway, Meadows, Nutting
Associates, Ramtek, Taito, Williams, etc. Some PONG clones could play
against the players. Some others played variants such as Football
and Hockey. Some more advanced even played PONG games in a "Breakout"
mode where the ball would destroy a number of squares placed on the
game field between the players. The PONG saga had an enormous success
during these years, until more advanced games appeared in 1975 after
what PONG left the market to leave the place for other games named Tank,
Indy 500, Space Invaders, PacMan, etc.<br><br>

You will find a very nice testimony of somebody discovering a PONG game in 1973 
at the bottom of this page (author unknown, text retrieved from a broken forum).<br><br>
Atari released the first arcade version of PONG in late 1972. The photo on the top of
 this page shows the very first prototype which was placed at
 Andy Capp's Cavern. Soon after, Atari launched the commercial
 version of PONG: the famous "yellow" cabinet. Earlier specimens
 had silver knobs whereas later ones had black knobs. Although
 some collectors prefer the first version, this kind of difference
 does not change the importance of PONG in the video game history,
 nor does it change the value of this game. The machines were numbered
 at the manufacturing plant and a lot of people say erratic things
 about the serial numbers of their machines. Nolan Buschnell (who
 designed Atari PONG) explained that the serials were encoded to
 avoid guessing how many machines were manufactured. Serials start
 with two same letters followed by three or four digits. The first
 machines to roll off the assembly line were numbered ZZ-001
 through ZZ-999, then AA-001 through AA-999, then YY-001 through
 YY-999 and then back to BB-001 through BB-999 and so on. Thus,
 the very first machine had serial ZZ-001 (see it at the
 <a href="http://www.atari-history.com">Atari Historical Society</a>)
 and those with serials starting with AA have machine between #1000
 and #1999. Those with YY have a machine between #2000 and #2999.<br><br>

 Pictured left: original Atari PONG upright from 
 David Winter's collection. This nice specimen looks almost as new and has not 
 been refurbished. It was made in 1973, has the second generation coin slot and 
 black knobs.<br><br></p>
 <p align=justify><font face="Arial" size="5"><u><b>Atari PONG electronic 
 circuits:</b></u></font></p>
<p>Unlike modern video games, PONG did not use a CPU, nor did it produce 
graphics with pixels. Every object put on the screen was generated by timing 
circuits used to encode the video signal and turn it on or off depending on its 
location. The global schematic of PONG can seem complicated, but in fact every 
section is not very hard to understand once the main operation is understood. 
Moreover, PONG happens to have one ghost hole on the upper left corner of the 
screen where the ball can only pass, and it even has a bug in the bounce 
circuitry (the schematic is correct, but the pcb has a mistake).<br>Those 
willing to understand PONG in detail should read <a href="LAWN_TENNIS.pdf">the 
excellent PDF file written by Hugo Holden</a>. Every section is dissected and 
explained with captions. This is so far the most detailed technical document 
about this game.</p></td>

Ramtek is a nice example. They started in 1973 and the circuit

mistake at the begining. As a matter of fact, a game without patent
has no protection against bootlegers, even if it uses an analog or
a digital system without software. Atari did not patent PONG until 1973 and many competitors started 
making their own version of PONG just
a few weeks after the release of Atari's game. Some copies are nearly
same, even so similar that the printed circuit board looks identical.
However, some other versions were designed from scratch, or at least from basic 
elements of Atari PONG such as sync, paddle and ball generators.<br><br>

 Amutronics TV PING PONG game on the left is very similar to Atari PONG: 
 woodgrain finish, same coin slot, diagonal curring of the front panel.</td>

<p align=justify>In 1973 the population of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan,_British_Columbia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Duncan, British Columbia</a>
was about 5000. Today, nearly 40 years later, it is still around 5000. 
Duncan is a small town, but it struggles to maintain that small town 
feel with outlying municipalities springing up subdivisions like 
mushrooms after a heavy rain. The tiny footprint of the city &#8212; all of 
two traffic lights on the Island Highway as you pass through &#8212; is being 
stamped with every kind of franchise imaginable, from Burger King to 
Home Depot to casinos and multiple McDonald&#8217;s.<br><br>

But it wasn&#8217;t always like this. In the early 1970s the outlying area 
around the city was largely undeveloped. You could ride your bike (with 
banana seat, of course) on trails that ran for miles along the Cowichan 
River. The annual exhibition took place on agricultural land that 
existed within the city limits. When that first McDonald&#8217;s opened in 
1978 it signaled the end of an era.<br><br>

In 1973 one of the popular local eateries was an Italian restaurant 
called Romeo&#8217;s. To my young eyes it was a place of mystery and intrigue,
an &#8216;adult&#8217; restaurant with subdued lighting that made me think of a 
coal mine (the aesthetics were more appreciated when I got a bit older).
The small lobby area, like the rest of the place, was dimly lit and had
everything you&#8217;d expect &#8212; a coat rack, some seats, the stand where the 
hostess would greet you and take you in. But one day we went in and 
something new was there. It was a machine unlike any I&#8217;d seen before.<br><br>

I&#8217;d heard of Pong and now I was staring directly at it: a cocktail 
table-style cabinet housing a TV screen, with controls on two sides that
consisted of simple knobs. The surface of the table was glass. I 
watched the strange phosphorous glow of the display, simple lines and a 
small square of light gently arcing back and forth between two 
rectangular blocks or &#8216;paddles&#8217;. This was like something from Star Trek.
I had to try it!<br><br>

25 cents for one play. In 1973 and to someone who had yet to hit 
double digits, 25 cents was a lot of money &#8212; more than the cost of a 
whole candy bar! I rarely had any money on me. My older brother did, 
though. He regarded me as his personal slave, so it seemed unlikely he&#8217;d
give or loan me the money to try it out. To my good fortune it turned 
out that Pong required two players. My brother would pay then &#8216;force&#8217; me
to play against him, keeping the hierarchy of owner/slave intact. 
Win-win, as far as I was concerned.<br><br>

I don&#8217;t remember how that first game went. I&#8217;m going to say I won due
to that intuitive little kid video game sense that so many little kids 
seem to have. What I do remember is how the simple act of turning that 
knob, seeing the paddle on the TV move in reaction and then hit that 
little square of light was magic. Magic.<br><br>

A few years later we got a home Pong unit. My brother, who liked to 
tinker with electronics, managed to take the controls that were 
hardwired to the console and break them out into handheld units, 
allowing us to play without being three feet in front of the TV. We 
still played sitting three feet in front of the TV because that&#8217;s what 
you did but we had the freedom to move if we wanted to.<br><br>

Pong led to the first video game system I owned myself &#8212; no 
negotiating with the big brother required! &#8212; the Atari VCS (later 
renamed the 2600). It didn&#8217;t come with Pong. The new world of video 
games moved quickly and already Pong was passé. It didn&#8217;t matter. Those 
early days of &#8216;electronic tennis&#8217; had already confirmed that I had a new
lifelong hobby, one I didn&#8217;t even know existed until I saw that glowing
screen in Romeo&#8217;s when I was nine years old.</p>

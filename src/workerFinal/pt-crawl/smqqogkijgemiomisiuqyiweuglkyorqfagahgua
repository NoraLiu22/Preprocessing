certainly more deadly, new research <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/vapes-flooding-market-fda-ban" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out" style="text-decoration-color:#ff9900">once again suggests</a> that there are downsides to e-cigarettes as well.</p><p>The research, <a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2024/04/08/tc-2023-058554" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out" style="text-decoration-color:#ff9900">published in the journal <i>Tobacco Control</i></a>, analyzed urine samples taken from teenage vapers. Among frequent vapers — those who vape between 5 to 19 days a month — urinary lead levels were 30 percent higher than in occasional users who used five or fewer days a month. Uranium levels, meanwhile, were twice as high for frequent vapers as occasional ones.</p><p>Those findings, according to the researchers, suggest that the use of e-cigarettes could spike the risk of metal exposure in youths. But they stress that the study was only observational and can&#x27;t prove a causal link between vape habits and metal exposure.</p><p>&quot;While vaping is thought to be a safe alternative to smoking, the aerosol still contains a range of chemicals, including heavy metals, that — with chronic exposure — may lead to long-term health effects,&quot; Kelly Burrowes, an associate professor at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute who was not involved in the study, said in a <a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/more-lead-and-uranium-found-in-teens-who-vape-often" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out" style="text-decoration-color:#ff9900">statement about the research</a>.</p><p>Vaping has slightly waned in popularity among teens, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7244a1.htm" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out" style="text-decoration-color:#ff9900">according to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey</a>, but it still remains their dominant form of tobacco consumption, accounting for around 90 percent. Overall, about 10 percent of US high schoolers use e-cigarettes.</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration has tried to crack down on underage vaping by <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-finalizes-enforcement-policy-unauthorized-flavored-cartridge-based-e-cigarettes-appeal-children" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out" style="text-decoration-color:#ff9900">banning many forms of flavored vapes</a>, which are popular among teens. The ban, however, has been criticized for its loopholes that have failed to limit the flavor selection for disposable vapes.</p><p>Beyond concerns over addiction to nicotine — which some vapes deliver in much higher concentrations than cigarettes — the presence of toxic metals is another question that looms over the safety of these devices, especially since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/health/illegal-vapes-ecigarettes-fda.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out" style="text-decoration-color:#ff9900">illegal ones have flooded the market</a>.</p><p>&quot;Cadmium and lead are often found in vape aerosol from the vape heating coil and soldering components,&quot; Burrowes said. &quot;However, uranium has not typically been reported in e-liquids or vape aerosol, but is an interesting finding due to its high toxicity.&quot;</p><p>It&#x27;s worth noting that some scientists have pushed back against the study&#x27;s findings. Lion Shahab, co-director of the University College London&#x27;s Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group, <a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-lead-and-uranium-levels-in-urine-of-teen-vapers/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out" style="text-decoration-color:#ff9900">noted</a> that levels of lead exposure were below &quot;typical reference values from the general population,&quot; and that the researchers did not use a control group in the form of teens who didn&#x27;t vape at all.</p><p>As for uranium, Shahab said that the metal &quot;specifically has many different important sources of exposure,&quot; like food and water — so vapes may not be the sole culprit here, if it indeed it is one.</p><p>&quot;This study therefore cannot tell us anything about absolute increase in exposure to heavy metals from e-cigarette use in this population, only about relative exposure among less and more frequent e-cigarette users,&quot; Shahab said, <a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-lead-and-uranium-levels-in-urine-of-teen-vapers/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out" style="text-decoration-color:#ff9900">via <em>Science Media Centre</em></a>. (He does think the research is &quot;well-conducted,&quot; however.)</p><p>Overall, the study may not paint the full picture, but it does raise interesting questions. No amount of lead exposure is safe, so if vapes are ever proved to spread the toxic metal, there&#x27;s a serious reckoning to be had about their risks.</p><p class=""><strong>More on vaping:

Among frequent vapers — those who vape between 5 to 19 days a month — urinary lead levels were 30 percent higher than in occasional users who used five or fewer days a month. Uranium levels, meanwhile, were twice as high for frequent vapers as occasional ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose findings, according to the researchers, suggest that the use of e-cigarettes could spike the risk of metal exposure in youths. But they stress that the study was only observational and can't prove a causal link between vape habits and metal exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While vaping is thought to be a safe alternative to smoking, the aerosol still contains a range of chemicals, including heavy metals, that — with chronic exposure — may lead to long-term health effects,\" Kelly Burrowes, an associate professor at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute who was not involved in the study, said in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/more-lead-and-uranium-found-in-teens-who-vape-often\"\u003estatement about the research\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaping has slightly waned in popularity among teens, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7244a1.htm\"\u003eaccording to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey\u003c/a\u003e, but it still remains their dominant form of tobacco consumption, accounting for around 90 percent. Overall, about 10 percent of US high schoolers use e-cigarettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US Food and Drug Administration has tried to crack down on underage vaping by \u003ca href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-finalizes-enforcement-policy-unauthorized-flavored-cartridge-based-e-cigarettes-appeal-children\"\u003ebanning many forms of flavored vapes\u003c/a\u003e, which are popular among teens. The ban, however, has been criticized for its loopholes that have failed to limit the flavor selection for disposable vapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond concerns over addiction to nicotine — which some vapes deliver in much higher concentrations than cigarettes — the presence of toxic metals is another question that looms over the safety of these devices, especially since \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/health/illegal-vapes-ecigarettes-fda.html\"\u003eillegal ones have flooded the market\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cadmium and lead are often found in vape aerosol from the vape heating coil and soldering components,\" Burrowes said. \"However, uranium has not typically been reported in e-liquids or vape aerosol, but is an interesting finding due to its high toxicity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's worth noting that some scientists have pushed back against the study's findings. Lion Shahab, co-director of the University College London's Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-lead-and-uranium-levels-in-urine-of-teen-vapers/\"\u003enoted\u003c/a\u003e that levels of lead exposure were below \"typical reference values from the general population,\" and that the researchers did not use a control group in the form of teens who didn't vape at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for uranium, Shahab said that the metal \"specifically has many different important sources of exposure,\" like food and water — so vapes may not be the sole culprit here, if it indeed it is one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This study therefore cannot tell us anything about absolute increase in exposure to heavy metals from e-cigarette use in this population, only about relative exposure among less and more frequent e-cigarette users,\" Shahab said, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-lead-and-uranium-levels-in-urine-of-teen-vapers/\"\u003evia \u003cem\u003eScience Media Centre\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. (He does think the research is \"well-conducted,\" however.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the study may not paint the full picture, but it does raise interesting questions. No amount of lead exposure is safe, so if vapes are ever proved to spread the toxic metal, there's a serious reckoning to be had about their risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore on vaping: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://futurism.com/neoscope/vaping-mental-health-sleep\"\u003eVaping Linked to Mental Health Issues\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":"2024-05-04T11:00:54","databaseId":319245,"featuredImage":{"__typename":"NodeWithFeaturedImageToMediaItemConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"MediaItem","sourceUrl":"https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2024/05/teens-vape-higher-levels-uranium-lead.jpg","mediaDetails":{"__typename":"MediaDetails","width":1200,"height":630}}},"featuredImageAttribution":"Getty / Futurism","featuredImageSourceUrl":"","miniTitle":"Heavy Glow","modified":"2024-05-01T12:56:19","modifiedGmt":null,"neoscopePostOptions":{"__typename":"Post_Neoscopepostoptions","shoes":null},"relatedPosts":[{"__typename":"Post","author":{"__typename":"NodeWithAuthorToUserConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"User","name":"Noor Al-Sibai"}},"databaseId":313530,"date":"2024-03-09T10:00:54","modified":"2024-03-09T10:00:54","category":{"__typename":"Category","acfCategoryFields":{"__typename":"Category_Acfcategoryfields","color":"#ff9900"},"link":"https://futurism.com/categories/neoscope","name":"Neoscope"},"featuredImage":{"__typename":"NodeWithFeaturedImageToMediaItemConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"Vaping is nearly as bad for one's body as smoking cigarettes — and new research indicates it may be harmful to mental health and sleep, too.","sourceUrl":"https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2024/03/vaping-mental-health-sleep.jpg"}},"title({\"format\":\"RENDERED\"})":"Vaping Linked to Mental Health Issues","miniTitle":"Up in Vapor","slug":"vaping-mental-health-sleep","subcategory":{"__typename":"Category","name":"Studies","slug":"studies"},"subtitle":"\"It can become a vicious cycle.\"","vertical":"NEOSCOPE"},{"__typename":"Post","author":{"__typename":"NodeWithAuthorToUserConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"User","name":"Sharon Adarlo"}},"databaseId":312761,"date":"2024-02-28T15:13:34","modified":"2024-02-28T15:13:34","category":{"__typename":"Category","acfCategoryFields":{"__typename":"Category_Acfcategoryfields","color":"#ff9900"},"link":"https://futurism.com/categories/neoscope","name":"Neoscope"},"featuredImage":{"__typename":"NodeWithFeaturedImageToMediaItemConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"Bad news, stoners.

Among frequent vapers — those who vape between 5 to 19 days a month — urinary lead levels were 30 percent higher than in occasional users who used five or fewer days a month. Uranium levels, meanwhile, were twice as high for frequent vapers as occasional ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose findings, according to the researchers, suggest that the use of e-cigarettes could spike the risk of metal exposure in youths. But they stress that the study was only observational and can't prove a causal link between vape habits and metal exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While vaping is thought to be a safe alternative to smoking, the aerosol still contains a range of chemicals, including heavy metals, that — with chronic exposure — may lead to long-term health effects,\" Kelly Burrowes, an associate professor at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute who was not involved in the study, said in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/more-lead-and-uranium-found-in-teens-who-vape-often\"\u003estatement about the research\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaping has slightly waned in popularity among teens, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7244a1.htm\"\u003eaccording to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey\u003c/a\u003e, but it still remains their dominant form of tobacco consumption, accounting for around 90 percent. Overall, about 10 percent of US high schoolers use e-cigarettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US Food and Drug Administration has tried to crack down on underage vaping by \u003ca href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-finalizes-enforcement-policy-unauthorized-flavored-cartridge-based-e-cigarettes-appeal-children\"\u003ebanning many forms of flavored vapes\u003c/a\u003e, which are popular among teens. The ban, however, has been criticized for its loopholes that have failed to limit the flavor selection for disposable vapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond concerns over addiction to nicotine — which some vapes deliver in much higher concentrations than cigarettes — the presence of toxic metals is another question that looms over the safety of these devices, especially since \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/health/illegal-vapes-ecigarettes-fda.html\"\u003eillegal ones have flooded the market\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cadmium and lead are often found in vape aerosol from the vape heating coil and soldering components,\" Burrowes said. \"However, uranium has not typically been reported in e-liquids or vape aerosol, but is an interesting finding due to its high toxicity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's worth noting that some scientists have pushed back against the study's findings. Lion Shahab, co-director of the University College London's Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-lead-and-uranium-levels-in-urine-of-teen-vapers/\"\u003enoted\u003c/a\u003e that levels of lead exposure were below \"typical reference values from the general population,\" and that the researchers did not use a control group in the form of teens who didn't vape at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for uranium, Shahab said that the metal \"specifically has many different important sources of exposure,\" like food and water — so vapes may not be the sole culprit here, if it indeed it is one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This study therefore cannot tell us anything about absolute increase in exposure to heavy metals from e-cigarette use in this population, only about relative exposure among less and more frequent e-cigarette users,\" Shahab said, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-lead-and-uranium-levels-in-urine-of-teen-vapers/\"\u003evia \u003cem\u003eScience Media Centre\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. (He does think the research is \"well-conducted,\" however.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the study may not paint the full picture, but it does raise interesting questions. No amount of lead exposure is safe, so if vapes are ever proved to spread the toxic metal, there's a serious reckoning to be had about their risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore on vaping: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://futurism.com/neoscope/vaping-mental-health-sleep\"\u003eVaping Linked to Mental Health Issues\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":"2024-05-04T11:00:54","databaseId":319245,"featuredImage":{"__typename":"NodeWithFeaturedImageToMediaItemConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"MediaItem","sourceUrl":"https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2024/05/teens-vape-higher-levels-uranium-lead.jpg","mediaDetails":{"__typename":"MediaDetails","width":1200,"height":630}}},"featuredImageAttribution":"Getty / Futurism","featuredImageSourceUrl":"","miniTitle":"Heavy Glow","modified":"2024-05-01T12:56:19","modifiedGmt":null,"neoscopePostOptions":{"__typename":"Post_Neoscopepostoptions","shoes":null},"relatedPosts":[{"__typename":"Post","author":{"__typename":"NodeWithAuthorToUserConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"User","name":"Noor Al-Sibai"}},"databaseId":313530,"date":"2024-03-09T10:00:54","modified":"2024-03-09T10:00:54","category":{"__typename":"Category","acfCategoryFields":{"__typename":"Category_Acfcategoryfields","color":"#ff9900"},"link":"https://futurism.com/categories/neoscope","name":"Neoscope"},"featuredImage":{"__typename":"NodeWithFeaturedImageToMediaItemConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"Vaping is nearly as bad for one's body as smoking cigarettes — and new research indicates it may be harmful to mental health and sleep, too.","sourceUrl":"https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2024/03/vaping-mental-health-sleep.jpg"}},"title":"Vaping Linked to Mental Health Issues","miniTitle":"Up in Vapor","slug":"vaping-mental-health-sleep","subcategory":{"__typename":"Category","name":"Studies","slug":"studies"},"subtitle":"\"It can become a vicious cycle.\"","vertical":"NEOSCOPE"},{"__typename":"Post","author":{"__typename":"NodeWithAuthorToUserConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"User","name":"Sharon Adarlo"}},"databaseId":312761,"date":"2024-02-28T15:13:34","modified":"2024-02-28T15:13:34","category":{"__typename":"Category","acfCategoryFields":{"__typename":"Category_Acfcategoryfields","color":"#ff9900"},"link":"https://futurism.com/categories/neoscope","name":"Neoscope"},"featuredImage":{"__typename":"NodeWithFeaturedImageToMediaItemConnectionEdge","node":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"Bad news, stoners.

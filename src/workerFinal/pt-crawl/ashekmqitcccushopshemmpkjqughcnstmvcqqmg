      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">All animals, at regular 
        intervals, shed their skin. Some, like humans, do it relatively unobtrusively 
        in a sort of ongoing process (we shed 1.5 million skin cells <em>every 
        hour</em> with a new skin surface every 28 days or so). Others do it quickly 
        and cleanly, like the one-piece sheds produced by snakes and tarantulas. 
        Most lizards are rather more leisurely about it, with their skin coming 
        off in patches. Some lizards are like snakes, tarantulas, and stick insects: 
        they climb out of their old skin, leaving it behind in one piece.</font></p>

        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Turtles and tortoises, 
        terrestrial and aquatic alike, shed their skin. Just as they are anatomically 
        structured rather differently than snakes and lizards, so, too is their 
        shed a bit different. The skin of the head, neck, limbs and tail sheds 
        off on a regular basis, just as it does in snakes and lizards, with the 
        skin coming off in pieces.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If the terrestrial 
        chelonian is too dry, the skin may hang like tattered rags, waving in 
        the breeze made as the chelonian walks around. A quick spray with water, 
        or a chance to wallow a bit in a shallow pan of water is generally all 
        that is needed. Do not let species from arid climates do a lot of soaking. 
        Some, like Russian tortoises, seem to be &quot;programmed&quot; to take 
        as much time soaking as possible whenever water is available, as it is 
        not often available in their native range. Provide a constant source of 
        soaking water for them, and they will stay in it to the point of causing 
        shell rot. Some species of tortoise and other terrestrial chelonians may 
        take advantage of more humid microclimates in the wild, burrowing under 
        plants, digging into the earth around their roots where moisture may be 
        retained long after it has dried up on the surface of the ground. These 
        species may benefit from the occasional wallow, soak or spray when they 
        appear to be having problems shedding.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The skin of aquatic 
        species, on the other hand, hangs off of the limbs, tail, neck or head 
        in a sort of filmy flag until it finally tears completely away.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The skin covering the 
        bony scutes also shed off. These are more often seen in aquatic species, 
        found by panicked owners who spot them at the bottom of the tank or see 
        them in mid-shed.</font></p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Pre-Shed Indicators<br>
        </strong></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Prior 
        to a shed, you will notice that the iguana starts to change colors. The 
        iguana's overall color will get dimmer, duller. Starting around his head 
        and hands, gray or white patches will start to appear (they will look 
        like they are wearing a white glove on one hand). The patches will appear 
        first in the head, then back, arms, then tail, as the different areas 
        get closer to actually shedding. Typically, iguanas start shedding at 
        their heads, with the progression going down the body, limbs, and finally 
        tail. Everything comes off, including the skin, over their ears, and the 
        spikes along the back.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The skin on their eyelids 
        will also shed off. At one point in the pre-shed period, you may walk 
        in to find your iguana has suddenly turned into some wild, bug-eyed monster. 
        Lying quietly, its closed eyes are puffed out 2-3 times their normal size. 
        This is quite natural - they are puffing them up with air as a way to 
        loosen the old skin. In a few days you will notice them rubbing their 
        closed eyes against any handy surface as they begin to loosen and rub 
        the skin off. Gentle head rubs, with your thumb and finger sliding over 
        the closed lids, are particularly welcomed at this time.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If you do not regularly 
        bathe or spray your iguana with water, you may wish to do so during pre-shed 
        and shed periods. In the wild, the natural humidity in the air and the 
        free access to rivers and streams helps the oily fluid build-up between 
        the skin layers keep the old skin soft and supple as it peels off. In 
        our much drier captive environments, the loosened pieces may dry out too 
        quickly, resulting in a much slower shed. Spraying with plain tap water 
        is all you need to do; the expensive vitamin and moisturizing sprays are 
        of unnecessary and not any better than plain water in a $0.99 spray bottle.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Shed<br>
        </strong></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Generally 
        speaking, don't pull the skin if it isn't ready to come off. Iguanas and 
        other lizards will rub themselves against things to help loosen and rid 
        themselves of skin. Mostly, though, they just sort of look like they are 
        wearing raggedy clothes, with strips and patches of skin hanging loose 
        and flapping around. If the skin is ready to come off, you can help it 
        do so by gently pulling at it. If the skin is not ready to come off, there 
        will be resistance, and the skin you remove will be damp.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Often times, spikes 
        need help to shed completely; gently working at them over the course of 
        several days, loosening the skin at the base and spraying them with water 
        will help. If shed is left on, it may constrict the growth of the living 
        tissue from which the spikes are made, resulting in the tissue dying and 
        the spikes falling or breaking off.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The same problem can 
        happen with toes and the narrow tail ends. If old shed is not removed, 
        it can constrict the toes and tails, killing the tissue by strangling 
        the nerve and blood supply that feeds it. Many books and vets claim that 
        carpet fibers are dangerous for this reason yet, in all my years of free-roaming 
        iguanas on wall-to-wall carpeting, I have never had such a problem. I 
        have taken in many iguanas, however, with two, three, up to five layers 
        of retained skin shed on toes and spikes...many of who lost toes and spikes 
        as a result. Part of your regular weekly, if not daily, overall examination 
        of the iguana should be checking toes, tails, and spikes to ensure that 
        they are clean, free of skin, fibers, and human or pet hair.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Sometimes the grommet-shaped 
        pieces of skin around the nostrils may not come off and, as your iguana 
        nears its next shed, you begin to hear a sort of distant whistling sound 
        as it breathes. After the next bath, work at this area gently to remove 
        any such retained shed.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A healthy iguana will 
        shed every 4-6 weeks. Iguanas aged 2-3 years may easily shed more often. 
        It is not uncommon to have an iguana be in the middle of one shed when 
        the next shed starts. During these times, they seem to be little more 
        than skin-producing machines, inhaling food and producing prodigious amounts 
        of both poop and mounds of shed. It is common for such growth to slow 
        down during our winters, and during this time of slowed growth and reduced 
        food intake, iguanas will often not shed. Where I live in Northern California, 
        the last shed usually occurs in November, with the fist shed of the new 
        year occurring in January or February, depending upon our weather patterns.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If your iguana is not 
        shedding, and it is not the winter slow-growth period, then there is a 
        problem. It may be that the environment is wrong, the diet is not nutritious 
        enough to promote growth or normal skin renewal processes, or your iguana 
        is sick. The iguana may also be psychologically stressed. A review of 
        the environment and diet is necessary, as is a review of any other factors 
        that may affect how the iguana responds psychologically/socially to his 
        environment. Slow growers should also be seen by a reptile veterinarian 
        to ensure that they are not suffering from bacterial infections, parasite 
        infestations, or other medical problems.</font></p>

        Lizards</strong></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Much of the information 
        in the <a href="#ig">iguana section</a> pertains to other lizards, whether 
        they shed in one piece (alligator lizards) or in many pieces. As with 
        iguanas, a change in overall color will occur, usually a dulling. A healthy 
        lizard will shed completely within a week or two. An unhealthy or stressed 
        lizard will take much longer (see <a href="#prob">Problem Sheds</a>).</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Like iguanas, other 
        lizards with movable eyelids will puff out their eyes in the days before 
        their head shed starts. This can be particularly alarming, especially 
        on chameleons (<em>Chameleo</em>, etc.) whose already large, protruding 
        eyelids may swell to several times their normal size, immediately deflating 
        when gently touched.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many lizards who, in 
        the wild, live in more arid areas are often kept too dry in captivity. 
        In the wild, they would make use of more humid microclimates, burrowing 
        down into the sandy ground, or heading into rocky crevices or burrows 
        where moisture remains despite the heat of the day. In captivity, we also 
        need to provide them with these <a href="microclimates.html">microclimates</a>, 
        either by keeping a patch of sand or other substrate damp (as for many 
        agamids), or by providing an easily accessible humidity retreat box.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">In the wild, some larger 
        lizards (monitors and tegus, for example), will soak in standing water 
        or in river shallows. In captivity, standing water can be provided by 
        putting into their enclosure a tub of water bowl, one large enough for 
        the lizard to comfortably sprawl in, but deep enough so that when the 
        lizard is fully submerged, the water doesn't overflow the tub and soak 
        the enclosure. With large lizards, the need for such a water tub must 
        be accounted for when designing and building an enclosure for the lizard.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2" ><a name="snake"></a></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000099"><strong>Snakes</strong></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong><font ><br>
        </font></strong>Snakes, like many lizards, utilize microclimates in the 
        wild, laying in underground burrows or in rocky crevices, under windthrow 
        (or under discarded boards around human habitation) where it is more humid. 
        In captivity, smaller snakes can be provided with a water bowl large enough 
        for them to comfortably (loosely) coil up in, deep enough so that when 
        they are fully submerged, the water doesn't overflow the top of the bowl.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Small to medium sized 
        snakes (up to 5 feet / 1.5 m) snakes can instead be provided with a <a href="microclimates.html">humidity 
        retreat box</a>, either as a permanent fixture in their enclosure, or 
        one that is put in when the color changes associated with the start of 
        the shed period are noted.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Snakes will also undergo 
        color changes prior to a shed.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Boids (boas and pythons) 
        will tend to grow dull, then get darker, sometimes becoming so dark that 
        it is hard to differentiate their normal markings from a distance. Those 
        boids with normally light colored bellies will often show signs of reddening 
        and increased blotching of the belly scutes. This is normal in boids, 
        especially pythons. Unfortunately, it can freak out the unprepared keeper 
        as a reddening of the belly scutes is also an sign of advanced septicemia 
        (systemic infection) and <em>Salmonella</em>. A good rule of thumb as 
        to when to panic and when not to is if the reddening belly occurs in conjunction 
        with an overall pre-shed darkening and <a href="#behav">associated behaviors</a>, 
        don't worry. If the reddening happens without the pre-shed color changes, 
        and/or in conjunction with other <a href="signs.html">signs of illness</a>, 
        worry and make a vet appointment.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Most colubrids lighten 
        up a bit, getting a milky cast to their skin, including their bellies. 
        Sometimes you will notice a dulling of the skin on their back and sides; 
        a look at their belly will tell you that it is a pre-shed change as the 
        belly starts to gray or lighten up.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Snakes go through a 
        several day period where their eyes cloud up as the fluid builds up between 
        the old and new spectacles. At its peak, the eyes are milky white with 
        a bluish cast to them (called &quot;white&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;). 
        Once the eyes clear, the snake will soon be ready to start its shed. I 
        have found that if I bathe a snake (in a warm bath, for 15-20 minutes) 
        the day the eyes are clear again, it will shed completely within the following 
        24 hours. I bathe the large snakes in the bathtub rather than wrestle 
        a tub full of water into and out of their enclosure; smaller snakes are 
        left to use their water bowl or humidity retreat boxes <em>ad lib</em>.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many snakes will defecate 
        at the same time that they shed. Before reaching in grabbing a handful 
        of shed skin that is partially obscured by substrate or furnishings, you 
        might want to check it out first...or always wear a glove!</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A cautionary note of 
        snake skin sheds: It is estimated that between 16-92% of snakes carry 
        one or more serotypes of <em>Salmonella</em> (tables and citations can 
        be found in my <a href="salmprec.html"><i>Salmonella</i> Precautions</a> 
        article). Researchers in one university laboratory found viable <em>Salmonella</em> 
        organisms on skin sheds that had been hanging in their lab for years. 
        Since testing for <em>Salmonella</em> is not very effective, use caution 
        when letting anyone who is at high risk for salmonellosis come into contact 
        with snake skin shed or in contact with anyone who has been handling shed 
        skin.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Always check your snake's 
        head shed to make sure that both eyecaps (&quot;spectacles&quot;) have 
        come off. If they have not, take steps to removed the <a href="eyeshed.html">retained 
        eyecaps</a>.</font></p>

        Behavioral Changes</strong></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong><font ><br>
        </font></strong>Going into shed is apparently not a real fun thing for 
        snakes and lizards. Most get rather cranky during this time, with some 
        individuals becoming hissy or snappy, objecting to being held or touched. 
        The best thing to do is to respect their ill-feeling as much as possible. 
        If you need to get in and service their enclosure, do it, but restrict 
        actual handling to that which is necessary.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">While reptiles may 
        still eat when in the very early phase of the pre-shed period, as the 
        period progresses, they usually lose their appetite. Most greatly reduce 
        their food intake; others stop eating altogether until after they have 
        shed. Some snakes will not eat while their eyes are milky; some will take 
        a meal once the eyes have cleared but before they shed, while others will 
        not eat until after they shed.</font></p>

        Sheds</strong></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong><font ><br>
        </font></strong>A problem shed is a shed that isn't happening like a normal, 
        healthy shed should. With a snake or any other reptile who is supposed 
        to shed in one piece, a problem shed would be a patchy shed. Instead of 
        working the whole skin off in one session, only bits and pieces come off, 
        with lots of skin retained on the body. A normal shed would be done within 
        a period of several hours or less from the time the shed is initiated; 
        a problem shed goes on for days or weeks with little progress. With lizards 
        who normally shed in pieces, a problem shed would be where it is taking 
        too long, or where skin is retained in problem areas, such as around toes, 
        spikes, and tails.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A problem shed is a 
        sign of an even greater, underlying problem. New snakes, especially imports, 
        typically have poor sheds their first one or two sheds in captivity. The 
        import and pet store process is less than healthy and stress-free, and 
        so their sheds reflect that period of prolonged stress (psychological 
        as well as environmental). Once they are housed properly, treated for 
        dehydration and parasites, and begin to psychologically acclimated to 
        captivity, they become healthier, and by the third shed, should be shedding 
        properly - quickly and in one piece.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The same problems may 
        be seen in sick and stressed lizards, especially imported ones. While 
        their skin may normally come off in patches, instead of the shed being 
        completed within the usual 1-3 weeks it would take for a healthy lizard, 
        it may go on for months, with areas never shedding at all. (I took in 
        a savanna monitor one time who had <em>five</em> layers of shed embedded 
        on its back and head!)</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>When a problem

        Myths</strong></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">There are many misunderstandings 
        about shedding. Two common ones are:</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Reptiles only 
        shed 2-4 times a year.<br>
        </strong>Shedding is a reflection of normal growth and renewal in a healthy 
        animal. If a reptile is not healthy, it will not shed as often as it should. 
        For example, healthy iguana will shed every 4-6 weeks, more often during 
        the peak growing season of spring and summer. A formerly neglected and 
        malnourished reptile who is started on a healthy diet in a properly constructed 
        environment may seemingly shed nonstop (each shed followed closely by 
        another shed) for several months as it undergoes a period of rapid growth, 
        almost like it is making up for all the years of retarded growth from 
        the poor care it had received.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">As with full-grown 
        humans, full-grown reptiles will continue to shed regularly as their old 
        skin is ready to slough off to be replaced by the newly formed layer underneath.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>If you pull 
        off shed that isn't ready to come off, you will cause mites.<br>
        </strong>You won't cause mites - they aren't created out of thin air. 
        However, pulling off skin before it is ready to come off can damage the 
        not-fully formed keratinous scales growing in place on the new skin layer 
        beneath the old. This can also injure the new skin layer...and mites always 
        look for the path of least resistance when looking for a blood meal. Thin 
        or defective (injured) skin provides less resistance to their mouthparts 
        than does the thickened skin with its protective covering of keratinous 
        scales.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The only way for your 
        reptile to &quot;get&quot; mites if you pull of skin that isn't ready 
        to come off is if your reptile's environment is already infested with 
        mites. There may be so few that you haven't noticed them yet...but given 
        the right environmental conditions-and easy access to food-they will multiply 
        with abandon. If there are no mites in the environment to begin with, 
        there won't be any mites after you impatiently pull off a piece of shed 
        that you shouldn't have. But your over-eagerness to be helpful will <em>still</em> 
        make the iguana uncomfortable, so restrain yourself!</font></p>

        DVM.</b> Dysecdysis: Abnormal Shedding &amp; Retained Eyecaps. p 368-370<br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Improper shedding, 
        or dysecdysis, is a symptom of a problem and not a primary problem....Other 
        management factors that cause improper shedding include: low temperatures 
        in the cage, low humidity, improper nutrition, and insufficient cage furniture 
        (logs, rocks, etc.) for rubbing. Once these husbandry factors are corrected, 
        shedding should return to normal.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">...The best method 
        to remove tattered skin is to soak the snake in tepid water in a container 
        deep enough to cover the snake's body but not so deep that the animal 
        drowns. <i>Never leave a soaking animal unattended!</i></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Some people advocate 
        adding various medicines to the soaking water, but in the author's opinion, 
        plain water is usually sufficient. If it becomes necessary to add an agent 
        to the water, such as an antibacterial agent, then a diluted iodine solution 
        (e.g., Betadine) can be used. The recommended dilution is approximately 
        1:50 (iodine:water), resembling weak iced tea. If the container being 
        used is clear, you should be able to read newsprint through the dilute 
        Betadine. If this is not possible, then the solution is too concentrated.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Stephen. L. Barten, 
        DVM</b>. Lizards. p 324-332</font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Dysecdysis, or difficult 
        shedding, may result in dry flaking, adherent patches of dead skin. The 
        most common cause of dysecdysis is a lack of humidity. Retained skin surrounding 
        the digits, dorsal spines, or tail tips shrinks as it dries, which compromises 
        the blood flow. This results in necrosis and sloughing of the affected 
        part. Retained skin must be removed by soaking and gentle peeling as soon 
        as possible after the shed is initiated by the lizard.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The species, age, state 
        of nutrition, reproductive status, parasite load, hormonal balance, infection 
        with bacterial or other skin pathogen, ambient temperature, and humidity 
        may have an effect on the frequency of ecdysis.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>John V. Rossi, DVM.</b> 
        Dermatology. p 104-117</font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Normal ecdysis in squamates 
        is a complex process in which cells of the intermediate zone (upper stratum 
        germinativum) replicate and form an entirely new three-layer epidermis 
        (called the new inner epidermal generation). Once the new surface is complete, 
        lymph diffuses into the area and enzymatic action results in the formation 
        of a cleavage zone, after which separation occurs (i.e., the outer generation 
        is sloughed). This growth and shedding requires about 2 weeks in most 
        lizards and snakes, while the resting phase may vary from days to months.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">One of the practical 
        applications of this process is the increased permeability of the skin 
        during the growth and shedding phase. Snakes sprayed with anti-mite medications 
        at this time appear much more susceptible to such toxins than those sprayed 
        at other times. Hence the use of topical insecticides should be sharply 
        curtailed at this time. Another observation is that severely malnourished 
        snakes and lizards appear to have a very difficult and irregular slough 
        (dysecdysis). This is likely due to the fact that hypoproteinemic animals 
        are unable to produce the full complement of enzymes necessary to complete 
        the breakdown between new and old epidermal generations. Further more, 
        this may explain why excessively dry environments retard normal ecdysis. 
        Drying out the fluid in the cleavage zone compromises the enzymatic and 
        lubricating action of the fluid, hereby resulting in an incomplete separation.</font></p>

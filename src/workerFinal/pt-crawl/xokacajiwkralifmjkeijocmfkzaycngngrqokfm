It was built in Amsterdam in 1628, and armed with 24 cast-iron cannons and a number of bronze guns. Batavia was shipwrecked on her maiden voyage, and was made famous by the subsequent mutiny and massacre that took place among the survivors. A twentieth-century replica of the ship, also called the Batavia can be visited in Lelystad, Netherlands."><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><style type="text/css">.style1 {	border: 1px solid #000000;}</style><meta http-equiv="window-target" content="_top" ><meta name="robots" content="index, follow"> </HEAD><BODY><!-- this page started 5th April 2014 --><br><br><center><h2><b><A HREF ="changes.html">Recent additions, changes and updates to Don's Maps</A></b></h2></center><center><br /><!-- CSS file for site and menu --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/layout.css" /><link rel="icon" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon" href="https://www.donsmaps.com/favicon.ico"></center><center><script type="text/javascript"><!--//--></script></center><!-- Menu down Left Hand Side --><div class="left_menu">Navigation<ul ><li><a class="normal" href="abeltasmantrack.html">Abel Tasman Track in New Zealand</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="kimberleyart.html">Aboriginal Art of the Kimberleys</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginalrockart.html">Aboriginal art on the Northern Tablelands of NSW</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginals.html">Aborigines of Australia</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="pataudtools.html">Abri Pataud Tools</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="raymonden.html">Abri de Raymonden</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="mihisalisburyaccess.html">Access to Mihi Gorge and to Salisbury Waters below the junction with  Mihi Creek </a></li><li><a class="normal" href="loess.html">Achenheim -

the ship</h1><b><i>Batavia</i> was a ship of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). It was built in Amsterdam in 1628, and armed with 24 cast-iron cannons and a number of bronze guns. Batavia was shipwrecked on her maiden voyage, and was made famous by the subsequent mutiny and massacre that took place among the survivors. A twentieth-century replica of the ship, also called the <i>Batavia</i>   can be visited in Lelystad, Netherlands.<br /><br /></b>Text above: Wikipedia<br /><br /><center><a href="images30/bataviaundersail.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/bataviaundersailsm.jpg" alt = "Batavia under sail " width="1000" height="750"></a><br /><br />A superb replica of the <i>Batavia</i> under sail. <br /><br />This replica was transported to Australia by barge in 1999, and was moored at the National Maritime Museum in Sydney. In 2000, the Batavia was the flagship for the Dutch Olympic Team during the 2000 Olympic Games. During its stay in Australia, the ship was towed to the ocean once, where it sailed on its own. On its return to harbour after the cruise, the mast was so high that  the ship  had to wait for an exceptionally low tide to clear Sydney Harbour bridge, on its way to the inner harbour. Even then, it only just got through. <br /><br />Photo: http://de.academic.ru/dic.nsf/dewiki/144816<br />Text: Wikipedia</center><br clear = "all"><br /><!-- <i>Unless otherwise noted, much of the text below has been adapted from a translation of François Pelsaert's Journal, at  http://www.kb.nl/sites/default/files/docs/batavia-translation.pdf which is also available at http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Abrolhos_tragedy .

It was also arguably the first megacorporation, possessing quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, coin money, and establish colonies. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century.<br />(Above text adapted from Wikipedia)<br /><br />One of these voyages occurred in  1628, when 8 ships of the VOC sailed from Texel bound for the East Indies on the 28th of October 1628 - the <i>Batavia</i>, under the command of  François Pelsaert, of Antwerp; <i>Dordrecht</i>, having for her merchant-captain the collector of revenue, Isaac van Swaenswyck, of Leyden; and the yacht <i>Assendelft</i>, under the command of the second merchant-captain, Cornelis Vlack, of Amsterdam. <br /><br /><!-- <p><a href="images30/texelmole.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/texelmolesm.jpg" alt = "texel mole  " width="442" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />The   <i>Batavia</i>'s  departure  from Texel, after it was loaded and provisioned  and  sailed away bound for the East Indies and its fate,  must have looked rather like this. <br /><br />Texel is one of a group of northern islands guarding the entrance to the Zuider Zee. <br /><br />The painting is known as 'The Harbour mole of Texel' by Willem van de Velde the Younger, 1673<br /><br />Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam<br /> Source: http://www.sailingwarship.com/category/17th-century</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />The <i>Batavia</i> grounded on shallows outside Antwerp, as did another of the fleet, and although the <i>Batavia</i> was able to float off unharmed on the next high tide, the other ship had to spend some months being repaired, and the fleet of seven continued. <br /><br />The  ships became separated, which was not uncommon for such voyages, and the Batavia continued on to the East Indies alone. <br /><br /><p><a href="images30/voctraderoutes.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/voctraderoutessm.jpg" alt = "VOC trade routes " width="812" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The Dutch East India Company, Trade Network, 17th Century<br /><br />At the time, the fastest and best method of getting to the East Indies was to use the Hendrik Brouwer route of 1611, which by this time was obligatory for VOC ships. From Cape of Good Hope, ships kept south, with the roaring forties behind them for as long as possible, estimating the distance travelled and thus the longitude by dead reckoning, then changed course to the north, following the west coast of what was to become Australia, in order to reach Batavia in Java, the head office of the VOC. This took as much as six months off the alternative journey up the east coast of Africa, to Java via India,  and resulted in better health and less loss of life for the crew and passengers. <br /><br />The problem was estimating your longitude, as no method was available for this calculation for ships at sea. <br /><br />Photo: &copy; Dr Jean-Paul Rodrigue, Dept of Global Studies and Geography, Hofstra University<br />Source: http://www.docstoc.com/docs/41061537/Dutch-East-India-Company-Trade-Network-17th-Century</p><br clear = "all"><br />--><p><a href="images30/bataviaimg_2210c.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/bataviaimg_2210csm.jpg" alt = "Batavia " width="380" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images30/bataviaimg_2208.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/bataviaimg_2208sm.jpg" alt = "Batavia " width="364" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Model of the <i>Batavia</i> (1628).  <br /><br /> This model was constructed by Geoffrey (Geoff) Kimpton, a former member of the Western Australian Museum's Department of Maritime Archaeology, who generously donated it to the department in April 2013.

The title is "Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht" which translates as "Chart of the Land of Eendracht". It is so named because that part of the coast was first charted by Dirk Hartog in the Eendracht in 1616.<br /><br />Note that North is to the left on this map, and that no longitudes are given, because longitude was not able to be calculated on a ship at that time. <br /><br />Important points shown on this map are Cape Leeuwin, the most south-western point of Australia, the Abrolhos Islands, Dirk Hartog's Island, and the most northerly point is the Willems River, now known as the Ashburton River. This river would have been an important watering point on a very dry coastline, and there was no need to plot any further points further north, as the coastline trends ENE after that point, and is no danger to ships heading for Java. <br /><br />The chart shows it as Willems revier, besocht by 't volck van 't Schip Mauritius in Iulius A° 1618 ('Willem's River, visited by the crew of the ship Mauritius in July 1618').<br /><br />Date: The original map was published in 1627<br />Photo: http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-rm749, National Library of Australia<br />Permission: Public Domain</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/crossstaff.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/crossstaffsm.jpg" alt = "crossstaff " width="398" height="350" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Latitude is calculated by measuring the height of the pole star at night in the northern hemisphere, or the noon sun above the horizon in both hemispheres. This cross-staff or Jacob's staff replaced the quadrant as the favoured instrument of mariners. The cross-staff was a wooden rod with a peep-hole at one end, and a sliding cross-piece. It was cheap and easily replaced if lost or broken. The navigator placed his eye against one end of the staff, and slid the cross-piece until he saw the lower tip at the horizon and the upper tip at the sun at local noon. The altitude of the celestial body could then be read from a scale marked on the main staff.<br /><br />Local noon is easily determined by recording periodic readings of the altitude of the sun. Since periodic readings of the altitude will plot a sine wave, the maximum reading is the one used for local noon, and ten or twenty minutes or so either side of the correct noon will make no appreciable difference to the latitude measured. <br /><br />The sun is also at noon when it is directly north or south of the observer. If a compass is used, and allowance is made for magnetic declination in that area of the globe, noon can be approximated. It just so happens that on the track of Pelsaert's journey north, magnetic declination is approximately zero, but this is not the case in other places. When shooting the sun at noon, a table had to be consulted, with the latitude dependent on the day of the year. <br /><br />Very accurate measurements of latitude had to account for correction for such things as  the refraction of the sun's light as it passes through the atmosphere, and the fact that the angle should be measured from the centre of the earth, but the observer is necessarily at the surface. This accuracy was not required for voyages such as this. <br /><br />Photo: http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/frobisher/fr57601e.shtml</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/bataviaastrolabe.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/bataviaastrolabesm.jpg" alt = "astrolabe " width="454" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br />However on the Batavia the Astrolabe, another instrument for measuring latitude, was certainly used. This was recovered from the wreck. <br /><br />Photo: &copy; WA Museum<br />Source: http://museum.wa.gov.au/explore/galleries/batavia-discovery-50th-anniversary</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/astrolabemariner.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/astrolabemarinersm.jpg" alt = "astrolabe " width="432" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />One advantage of the astrolabe is that if it is heavy, and suspended from the ring, it remains vertical, even in a boat, and thus  it was not necessary   to see the horizon. Another big advantage is that it was not even necessary to look directly at the sun, as was required in the use of the cross-staff. The light of the sun passing through a hole in the alidade is aligned on a second similar hole, or a mark,  on the other end of the alidade.  When aligned, the altitude in degrees  of the sun is measured on the scale on the circumference. The latitude is obtained by subtracting this value  from 90 degrees, at least at the time of the equinoxes.  <br /><br /> A correction must then be made at other  times of the year from a table. Mariner's astrolabes of this type were not very accurate, especially when they were used on a small boat or in a strong wind, but were extremely useful. <br /><br />This is a silver-plated mariner's astrolabe made by Nicolao Ruffo and dated 1645. The astrolabe was found by Gigi Fernandes Corcia, an experienced diver and full time member of the Arqueonautus dive team, during the survey and excavation of a wreck site at Passa Pau on the island of Santiago in November of 1999.<br /><br /> The astrolabe was found associated with other wreck material of mid-seventeenth century date within a complex of deep gullies and caves at a depth of 7 to 12 meters. There was little or no site contamination with extraneous material. <br /><br />  This astrolabe has been catalogued as the 84th astrolabe in existence with The National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. It is in the collection at The Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia.<br /><br />Photo: 	Neochichiri11<br />Permission: Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication.<br />Additional text concerning this particular astrolabe is from Wikipedia. </p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br /><b>Distances: Note that the dutch mile was about 5&nbsp;840 metres. Since a degree of latitude is about 111 km, this is equivalent to 19 dutch miles. This is important when trying to make sense of Pelsaert's journal of his journey north  in the longboat to the Citadel of Batavia on the island of Java.  However Pelsaert seems to have used a value close to 15.4 dutch miles to the degree latitude.  </b><br /><br />For example: <br /><br /><i>On 24 June at noon, had the latitude of l3 degrees 30 minutes, this 24 hours  sailed 25 miles, held north by west, the wind mostly s.-e. by s., topgallant, with dry  weather.  On 25 June  at noon, had the latitude of 11 degrees 30 minutes, this 24 hours  sailed 31 miles, held n. by w., the wind more to s.-e., topgallant, with dry weather, nevertheless we saw much steenkroos (Bladder Weed)  floating. On 26 June. at noon had the latitude of 9 degrees 56 minutes, this 24 hours sailed 24 miles, held n. by w., the wind mostly s.-east with dry weather. </i><br /><br />So in two days he had sailed 3.57 degrees and made 55 miles by his reckoning, making 15.4 dutch miles to the degree latitude. <br /><br />--><p><a href="images30/captainstable.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/captainstablesm.jpg" alt = "captain's table" width="400" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />The Great Cabin shown was the nerve centre of the ship.

The hammocks of sometimes 300 or more men hung right against each other. <br /><br />Many of the cabin fittings, writing equipment, eating and drinking utensils, and personal items have survived from the wreck. Other furnishings are representations based on contemporary ship models, paintings and other illustrative material.   <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock October 2014<br />Source and text: The Shipwreck Galleries, Western Australia Museum, Fremantle, Western Australia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/navigationaids.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/navigationaidssm.jpg" alt = "navigational aids" width="400" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Navigational aids  aboard the Batavia replica.  <br /><br />Photo: http://addiator.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/batavia-shipyard.html</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/pumps.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/pumpssm.jpg" alt = "pumps" width="400" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Pumps  aboard the Batavia replica.

In the afternoon the wind changed to west, than to north, sothat they could sail west. <b>Towards evening they saw the wreck of their ship Batavia</b>, and the Commodore was seen from the high island, though the mates said it was not one of the islands. Attwo o’clock in the night they anchored in a clear, sandy bottom at 27 fathoms depth.<br /><br />On the morning of the 17th they again weighed the anchor. The wind was north. They were still about two miles from the high island; they approached it in a south-westerley direction. Before noon, having come about the island, they saw close to the wreck, on a long islet, some smoke, at which they were much rejoiced, hoping to find all or most of their people alive. Having cast the anchor, the Commodore, taking with him a cask of water, and bread and wine, went with the boat to the highest island, which was nearest by; but on arriving there he found no one, at which they were all very much astonished. Jumping ashore, they saw a little boat with four men rowing round the northern point. The one whose name was Wiebbie Hayes jumped ashore, meeting the Commodore, and welcoming him, but begging of him to return immediately to the ship,  as there were a party of miscreants on the islands about the wreck, who intended to come in two boats and seize the yacht on its arrival. <br /><br /> He related how he had become a captain of forty-seven people, who, to save their lives, had kept all that time on a little island, since some of the people, who were left behind, had turned scoundrels and murdered some one hundred and twenty-five people, being men, women and children. About fourteen days ago the supercargo, Jerome Cornelisz, the chief of these scoundrels, had been captured by him.<br /><br />       <p><a href="images30/webbiehayesoutline.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/webbiehayesoutlinesm.jpg" alt = "webbye hayes " width="337" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Wiebbie Hayes  <br /><br />This bronze statue of Wiebbie Hayes was commissioned by the  City of Geraldton-Greenough, Western Australia. <br /><br />Photo: Perth Castings Art Foundry<br />Artist: Tony Horn<br />Source: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.188494561178867.52480.134338836594440&type=3</p><br clear = "all"><br /> <p><a href="images30/franciscopelsaert.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/franciscopelsaertsm.jpg" alt = "francisco pelsaert " width="315" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Francisco Pelsaert <br /><br />Bruce Martin as Francisco Pelsaert in Richard Mills's Batavia in Melbourne in 2001. <br /><br />In reality, Pelsaert had long black hair, and a goatee beard. <br /><br />Photo: Jeff Busby<br />Source: http://www.opera-opera.com.au/archive/brucemartin.html</p><br clear = "all"><br />--><!-- <p><a href="images30/pelsaertopera.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/pelsaertoperasm.jpg" alt = "francisco pelsaert " width="283" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Francisco Pelsaert <br /><br />Bruce Martin as Francisco Pelsaert in Richard Mills's Batavia in Sydney in 2006. <br /><br />Photo: http://chrisboyd.blogspot.com.au/2006_08_01_archive.html</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/jeronimuscornelisz.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/jeronimuscorneliszsm.jpg" alt = "jeronimus cornelisz" width="291" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />Jeronimus Cornelisz <br /><br />Michael Lewis as  Jeronimus Cornelisz in Richard Mills's Batavia. <br /><br />Photo: http://www.michaellewis.net.au/audiovisual/photos/files/page2-1032-full.html </p><br clear = "all"><br /> --><!-- The Dutch and English fought several naval battles in the 17th century. Usually the Dutch won. The Royal Navy's most complete and humiliating defeat came when the Dutch raided the naval base at Chatham and burnt or towed away several English warships. See the Battle of the Medway.The Dutch were able to build warships and trading ships such as the Batavia quicker and cheaper than the English because they used a superior technology, the wind powered sawmill.Instead of sawing planks manually the Dutch built over 200 wind powered sawmills and used them to produce sawn planks and posts for their shipyards. Wind powered sawmills produced major productivity increases ["With hand sawing, 60 beams or trunks would take 120 working days, with wind power this only took 4 to 5 days"].Two wind powered sawmills can be seen at the Zaanse Schans open-air museum in Holland, not far from the Batavia shipyard.   <p><a href="images30/bataviarescue.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/bataviarescuesm.jpg" alt = "The return of Pelsart " width="533" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />The return of Pelsaert in the rescue ship <i>Sardam</i> from Batavia in Java, the head office of the VOC. <br /><br />Clockwise from top left:<br /><br />1.

These had repeatedly come across to fight him and his men, but every time they had been bravely kept off; then they had used traitorous and sinister means to conquer and murder them, offering them peace through the intermediation of their minister, Gysbert Sebastiaensz, whom they forced to go backwards and forwards. <br /><br />When they came to conclude the peace with solemn oaths, promising to forget and forgive all that had passed, David van Seevanck and Coenraldt van Huyssen tried to bribe some soldiers to treason, offering them each six thousand guilders, if, when they returned next day after the conclusion of the peace, these men would side with them and help to kill the others.

Meanwhile he continued his course to the ship. On reaching her, he found that the rebels were boldly coming on in the same direction. When they were close enough he could distinguish their red cloth dresses, trimmed all over with gold lace. The Commodore asked them why they came on board armed.

Seeing that that had no escape, they obeyed, and coming on board, they were at once put in irons. Their examinations commenced at once. <br /><br />[Marginal note: Confession of Jan Hendricksz of Bremen.] <br /><br />The first one to be examined was Jan Hendricksz, of Bremen, soldier, who immediately let out and confessed to have killed and helped to kill 17 or 20 people, but everything at the express orders of Jerome Cornelisz, their captain, who had forced them to it. Having further been questioned as to the causes and circumstance off all this, and as to what had let them to such inhuman cruelty, he stated his willingness to reveal everything, also how all had happened in the beginning, viz., that he Skipper, Adriaen Jacobsz, Jerome Cornelisz, and the first boatswain had made a compact with the others to seize the vessel Batavia, before it was wrecked, to kill the Commodore and all the crew and passengers, except about 120 who were in the plot, and to throw the dead overboard into the sea; then to go pirating and free-booting with the vessel. Wherefore Jerome Cornelisz and his men on the island had made sure that the Skipper would have killed the Commodore on the way, or have thrown him overboard into the sea, and having been on the island for a month, he thought he could do nothing better than kill all the people but forty, with whom he would seize the yacht on its arrival. He felt, however, that this could not be done unless Wiebbie Hayes and his men, who had been sent to the long island for water twenty days before, were put out of the way. They had started upon this fiendish expedition, and made some attacks already, but had not succeeded.<br /><br />[Marginal note: Jerome Cornelisz is given up.] <br /><br />Towards evening Wiebbie Hayes  brought Jerome Cornelisz to the Commodore on board ship as a prisoner. The Commodore looked at him with deep sorrow, not being able to conceive what had induced him to forget himself so far that he had become the cause of such inhuman murders. Being examined in the presence of the Council, the Commodore asked him why he had allowed the devil to lead him so far astray from all human feeling, and had done that which had never been so cruelly perpetrated among  Christians, without any real need of hunger or thirst, solely out of cold bloodthirstiness, and to attain his wicked ends. To which he repealed that they should not blame him for what had happened , putting it all on David van Seevaneck, Coenraldt van Huyssen and others, who had been killed in the last encounter with Wiebbie Hayes' men. <br /><br />He said they had forced him to it, threatening otherwise to take his life. One had often to do a great deal to save oneself. He denied ever having had the intention to help to seize the vessel Batavia, and as to the project of seizing any yacht that should come to their rescue he said Seevanck had proposed this, and he only consented, but without meaning it seriously, since he supposed that they would never be delivered form these unfortunate islands. For he had hard one, Ryck Woutersz, say that Skipper Adriaen had intended to seize the vessel, if it had not been wrecked, and to throw the Commodore overboard, which made him think that they could never have reached Batavia. But that the Skipper must have gone to Malacca; or should it have happened that the Commodore had reached Batavia, and that a yacht were sent to their rescue, he would have tried to give warning. In this manner, he tried to excuse himself with his glib tongue, telling the most palpable lies, and making out that he had been altogether innocent and ignorant of everything, often appealing to the mates, as if they could have known his inner thoughts, saying that they would give a similar testimony. At this the matter was left that day, and he was again incarcerated.<br /><br />On the 18th September before daylight, the Commodore and the Skipper went with the two boats to the long island, were Wiebbie Hayes  was with his men. He took the soldiers from thence, arming each with a good musket. With those he proceeded to the island named “Batavia’s Churchyard,” which was close to the wreck; his intention was to catch the remaining scoundrels, who were still there, and make them prisoners. When they saw the Commodore approaching with his two well-manned boats, their hearts immediately failed them,<br /><br />[Marginal note: The remaining scoundrels taken.] <br /><br />and their courage sank before they had made any resistance. They said to each other, 'Now we are all dead men' thinking that they were going to be killed in hot haste. But in this they were mistaken. When the Commodore had landed, he caused all the rebels to be bound hand and foot, and to be secured as prisoners; then his first work was to seek the jewels that lay scattered here and there. Those were all found except a gold chain and ring, though the ring came to light after all.<br /><br /><p><a href="images30/bataviahangingtorturing.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/bataviahangingtorturingsm.jpg" alt = "Hanging and torturing " width="519" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br />Hanging on the island and the torturing back at the island of Java. <br /><br />Photo: Plate 6, 1647 Dutch book Ongeluckige voyagie, van't schip Batavia ('Unlucky voyage of the ship Batavia).

The island itself is essentially a continuation of the Edel Land Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow channel, the South Passage. The west side of the island includes high cliffs and a high energy coastal environment, while the east coast has a significantly lower elevation and many sheltered bays and sandy beaches. The surface of the island is covered by sands, with large mobile dunes on the southern end. There is no surface fresh water.

On board the Amsterdam was the Councillor of the Indies, Jacob Dedel. The new land was named Dedelsland after him as the highest ranked person.The weather did not allow closer examination and the two ships sailed north, keeping far out from shore. On 29 July, de Houtman discovered several low islands surrounded by extensive coral reefs.The position of these islands was accurately plotted and as a warning they were named De Houtman Abrolhos, meaning ‘look out’.Pelsaert Island Aerial ShotRight: Aerial view of Pelsaert Island, Houtman Abrolhos. Photo: Patrick Baker, Western Australian Museum.This warning, however, did not prevent the loss of two Dutch East India Company ships in the Houtman Abrolhos some years later — Batavia in 1629 and Zeewijk in 1727. In their letters home, de Houtman and Dedel’s mention of gold made their masters extremely interested in the new land and keen to investigate futher.Although the VOC took every measure to keep the sailing routes secret, competitors inevitably got to know about them. In 1622 the English East India Company ship Trial tried to follow the new south route but the voyage ended in catastrophe off the Monte Bello Islands.‘This Southland, it seems to be fine country as we could see…’‘…one should stay clear of this shoal, for it lies most treacherously for ships that want to call in at this land.

Reefs that formed during the Eemian interglacial (about 125&nbsp;000 years ago) when sea levels were higher than at present, are now emergent in places, and constitute the basement of the group's central platform islands, which include West Wallabi Island. <br /><br />Text above on the geology of the islands: Wikipedia<br /><br /><br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/wellafterrain.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/wellafterrainsm.jpg" alt = "Fort " width="800" height="445" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Fort beside one of the wells on West Wallabi Island after rain. <br /><br />This photograph partly explains why the well in solid rock was initially dug, and afterwards held water. After rain the water would soak into the cracks in the rock, feeding the lens of fresh water floating on  salt water, commonly available on islands of this type,  and be available only a metre or so below the surface of this depression on a  low lying island.<br /><br />The well might have been dug by the Portuguese, who had the right to explore this part of the world by the Treaty of Zaragoza, 1529, although there is little concrete evidence of their exploring the west coast of Australia. Their maps and observations of new lands were kept secret for commercial reasons, and most have vanished. <br /><br />  The idea to dig a well at this point into solid rock on an otherwise waterless island, an apparently futile project, would suggest itself at a time when there was still some surface water from rain. A shallow well would then access the water held in the cracks in the rock below the ground. This effect often  occurs on small, low lying islands composed of porous materials such as coral or lime or sandstone. <br /><br />Photo: http://historymatrix.wordpress.com/page/2/<br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/freshwaterwellisland.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/freshwaterwellislandsm.jpg" alt = "Ghyben-Herzberg Principle " width="499" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br />In the late 1800s - early 1900s  hydrologists working along Europe's coast observed that fresh ground water, appearing to float as a lens-shaped body on seawater, extended below sea level approximately 40 times the height of the freshwater table above sea level. <br /><br />Named the Ghyben-Herzberg Principle after the two scientists who described it, this 1-to-40 relation occurs because freshwater is slightly less dense than seawater (1.000 grams per cubic centimetre (g/cm<sup><small>3</small></sup>) versus 1.025 g/cm<sup><small>3</small></sup>). <br /><br />Thus, for example, if the water table at a given site is 3 feet above sea level, the freshwater-seawater transition zone is 120 feet below sea level, and the vertical thickness of the freshwater body there is 123 feet.<br /><br />Photo and text: http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2000/fs-057-00/</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/fort2.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/fort2sm.jpg" alt = "Fort " width="449" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="images30/fort4.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/fort4sm.jpg" alt = "Fort " width="400" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />There are at least two forts on the island, built in 1629 by the group led by Wiebbe Hayes , known as the Defenders, who were holding out against the mutineers during the Batavia Mutiny.<br /><br />Photo (left) &copy; michael.jolly<br />Source: Panoramio<br /><br />Photo (right) Rupert Gerritsen, Permission: Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license<br /><br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images30/brousconworldmap.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images30/brousconworldmapsm.jpg" alt = "world map " width="800" height="709" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />One of the series of maps known as the Dieppe Maps.<br /><br /> It is a map of the world, which includes America and a large promontory of the "Terre Ostrale" (Terra Australis) inscribed in its northern part terre de lucac (Locach).

Following impregnation, the timbers were slowly dried out over a period of 10 - 12 months. <br /><br />The treated timbers were reconstructed in this gallery on a specially designed steel support structure. The temperature and humidity has to be carefully controlled to ensure that the conserved timbers remain stable. Each timber is held in place using stainless steel bolts driven into the original bolt holes.

It is not clear, therefore, whether the make of the <i>Batavia</i> guns would have been English, Swedish, German (the Trips had foundries in Waldeck and Westphalia), French or Dutch.

However, composite guns were not strong enough to fire cannon balls and were therefore used for firing anti-personnel shot such as wired musket balls, nails and stones. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock October 2014<br />Source and text: The Shipwreck Galleries, Western Australia Museum, Fremantle, Western Australia</p><br clear = "all"><br />Markings on the cannon show that it was owned by the Amsterdam Chamber of the VOC and weighed 1715 Amsterdam pounds, about 850 kg.

It was decided to cut out a long section which could be studied then replaced. <br /><br /><b>How the composite cannon was made</b><br /><br />A sheet of copper for the bore of the gun was moulded to form a tube. Six flat iron bars running the length of the gun were mounted around the copper tube and fixed in place by 30 wrought iron bands ranging in thickness from 16 to 56 mm. <br /><br />The gunpowder chamber in the breech was formed separately, strengthened with additional iron bands and held in place by hammering over the ends of the long iron bars. The trunnions (projections on each side which supported the gun on its wooden carriage) were then attached and iron pins mounted around them. Copper sheathing was then fitted to the outside of the whole gun forming an ornamental casing. <br /><br />At this stage, the gun was covered in clay, upended and heated. Molten lead solder was then poured into the top until all the spaces between the different metals were filled. A copper disc was then soldered onto the end and the bronze cascabel (the knob at the end) screwed into place with an iron screw. This has since corroded away on the example shown here. <br /><br /><br /><p><a href="images31/img_8417batavia.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images31/img_8417bataviasm.jpg" alt = "Batavia " width="690" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Bronze cannon, length 3525 mm, bore 120 mm<br /><br />Dutch East Indiamen were armed in order to defend and maintain the power of the VOC on Indian Ocean trade routes. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock October 2014<br />Source and text: The Shipwreck Galleries, Western Australia Museum, Fremantle, Western Australia</p><br clear = "all"><p>This is the longest of five bronze guns recovered from the wreck, raised by the Royal Australian Navy in 1963.

Friesland, Gelderland, Holland, Kampen, Overijssel, Utrecht, West Friesland, Zeeland, and Zwolle minted armoured half bust rijksdaalders until the end of the 17th century.<br /><br />The 17th century rijksdaalder was set to be equal to from 48 to 50 stuivers (the Dutch equivalent of shillings) and circulated along with silver florins (28 stuivers), daalders (30 strivers), leeuwendaalders (36 to 42 strivers), silver ducats (48 stuivers), and ducatons (60 stuivers). While leeuwendaalders (lion dollars) were made of less pure silver at 427.16 grains of .750 fineness,  silver ducats and rijksdaalders were almost of the same size and quality. With the disappearance of the original armoured half bust rijksdaalder design, silver ducats and later ​2&frac12; guilders started to be called rijksdaalders.<br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2017<br />Source:  Museum of Geraldton, Western Australia<br />Text: Wikipedia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images36/dsc01146dividersprotractor.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/dsc01146dividersprotractorsm.jpg" alt = "dividers protractor" width="429" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Brass dividers BAT 3406 and BAT 421 <br /><br />Brass  protractor BAT 422 <br /><br />This brass protractor is not on the VOC list of equipment.

The attack was definitely fatal. <br /><br />The skull was recovered from 'Batavia's graveyard' (Beacon Island) in 1964 by Hugh Edwards and Ron Taylor. In 2015, as part of an Australian Research Council funded project <i>Shipwrecks of the Roaring 40s</i>, archaeologists excavated the remains of the skeleton associated with the skull. The sliver of bone was found in the gravesite and is the missing section from the skull.   <br /><br /> Catalog:  BAT A 16316<br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2017<br />Source and text:  Museum of Geraldton, Western Australia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images36/dsc01176jug.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/dsc01176jugsm.jpg" alt = "jug" width="328" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /> Beardman jug from the Batavia.  <br /><br />Salt glazed stoneware.  <br /><br /> Catalog: unknown, possibly  BAT 21628<br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2017<br />Source and text:  Museum of Geraldton, Western Australia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images36/dsc01178bluejug.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/dsc01178bluejugsm.jpg" alt = "jug" width="291" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /> Westervald jug from the Batavia.  <br /><br />   Typical of the highly ornate style of jugs produced in the Westerwald.     <br /><br /> Catalog:  BAT 2303<br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2017<br />Source and text:  Museum of Geraldton, Western Australia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images36/dsc01180silver.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/dsc01180silversm.jpg" alt = "coins" width="503" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /> Although most of the silver carried by the Batavia was recovered and taken back to the city of Batavia, some was left behind. <br /><br />Catalog:  unknown<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2017<br />Source and text:  Museum of Geraldton, Western Australia</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images36/dsc01181iso1250eighthsec.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images36/dsc01181iso1250eighthsecsm.jpg" alt = "measure" width="334" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Copper powder measure with the Roman numerals VII  scratched on the handle and the front lip.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 41 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/batavia.html responseCode 3 200

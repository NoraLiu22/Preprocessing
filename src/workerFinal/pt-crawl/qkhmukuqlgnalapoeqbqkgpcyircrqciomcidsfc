<H2>US: Bill Aims To Reduce Drug Flow To USA</H2>
<P>

WASHINGTON - Two Republican members of Congress plan to introduce a bill
Wednesday to spend $2.6 billion over the next three years to reduce the
amount of illegal drugs coming into the country by 80%.

<P>

The bill, by Sen. &nbsp;Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and Rep. &nbsp;<B>Bill McCollum</B>, R-Fla.,
includes $430 million for 10 radar aircraft to monitor airspace over the
three major cocaine-producing countries - Peru, Bolivia and Colombia.

<P>

The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act also would set aside $300
million for a new U.S. &nbsp;airbase to support counternarcotics efforts in the
Caribbean, northern South America and the Pacific coast of Central and South
America. &nbsp;No site has been chosen for the proposed facility.

<P>

The money, if approved by Congress, would be added to $51 billion to be
spent on the drug war over the next three years.

<P>

"Our objective is not to take away from other areas," DeWine said. &nbsp;"We're
not here saying we should do less in treatment and education."

<P>

The USA will also buy equipment and aircraft for other countries. &nbsp;For
example: $72 million for six helicopters for the Colombian National Police,
and $7 million for X-ray machines to scan for vehicles carrying drugs on the
main highway out of Bolivia's cocaine-producing region.

<P>

<B>McCollum</B> and DeWine say financing is needed because lower priority has been
given to stopping drugs from leaving producing countries and the destruction
of crops.

<P>

While the amount of money spent for eradication and interdiction has
remained steady, it has fallen as a percentage of total anti-drug spending.

<P>

DeWine said interdiction efforts throughout the years "have been off and on."

<P>

As part of the drug war, the U.S. &nbsp;Defense Department earmarked $504.5
million for interdiction in 1992, but that fell to $214.7 million in 1995.

<P>

That cut led to a reduction in flying hours by AWACS aircraft from 38,100
hours in 1992, to 17,713 in 1996, DeWine said.

<P>

At the same time, "there's not a ship, there's not a plane" patrolling the
Pacific coast of Central and South America, <B>McCollum</B> said. &nbsp;The Drug
Enforcement Administration says that 57% of the estimated 291 metric tons of
cocaine smuggled into the USA each year comes from that area.

<P>

Bob Weiner, spokesman for the Office of Drug Control Policy, said, "The
administration strongly supports interdiction and that's why there's a 9%
increase in the budget for interdiction this year." President Clinton has
asked for a 12% increase in interdiction funding next year.

<P>

Weiner said a second issue is "where is the money coming from for this
proposal. &nbsp;We haven't seen a specific answer on that and we need to find out.
. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;In addition, we have to be sure we're getting the biggest bang for the
buck."<P>

<H1>HILL GROUP OFFERS PLAN <BR>TO STANCH DRUG FLOW</H1>

<H2>HILL GROUP OFFERS PLANTO STANCH DRUG FLOW</H2>
<P>

<H3>$2.6 Billion Sought For Aircraft, Vessels</H3>
<P>

Accusing the Clinton administration of doing too little to stem the flow of
cocaine and heroin to the United States from Latin America, congressional
Republicans yesterday proposed a $2.6 billion effort that they claim would
reduce the traffic by 80 percent in three years.

<P>

The plan, unveiled by Sen. &nbsp;Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) and Rep. &nbsp;<B>Bill McCollum</B>
(R-Fla.), calls for the money to be spent on strengthening interdiction
efforts in the Caribbean region as well as along the Pacific coast of
Central America and Mexico. &nbsp;Bills that would implement the proposal will be
submitted in both the House and Senate today.

<P>

"The great untold story in recent years is the decline in interdiction
efforts," DeWine said, noting that spending on drug-use prevention programs
and anti-trafficking efforts in the United States has tripled since 1987,
while funding for interdiction has risen less than 20 percent.

<P>

Part of the reason for that, law enforcement officials say, is that the
Clinton administration chose to focus on blocking the transshipment of
drugs across the Mexican border and on expanding efforts to reduce the
demand for drugs at home rather than concentrating on reducing the supply
from drug-producing regions.

<P>

The Republican lawmakers, who have been joined in the Senate by Democrat
Bob Graham of Florida, say that funding for the effort would not come at
the expense of domestic prevention programs or law enforcement. &nbsp;Beyond
saying that House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) had promised to include
funding for the plan in a supplemental appropriations bill later this year,
however, they did not specify where the money would come from.

<P>

<B>McCollum</B> said the expenditure is necessary to intercept drugs before they
reach the United States and that the plan would greatly enhance the
capabilities of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Coast Guard and
the Customs Service to track and interdict illegal drug shipments. &nbsp;While
most of the money would be spent on equipment, some would be targeted at
improving intelligence-gathering functions, he said.

<P>

<B>McCollum</B> said law enforcement officials in the United States and across
Latin America had told him they could reduce the flow of drugs to the
United States by more than 50 percent within two years if they are given
the necessary resources. &nbsp;"The Clinton administration calls for a 50 percent
reduction in 10 years," <B>McCollum</B> said. &nbsp;"That is unacceptable; we are
calling for an 80 percent reduction in three years and think that is very
feasible."

<P>

Robert Weiner, spokesman for the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
said the administration "supports interdiction as part of a comprehensive
strategy to fight drug trafficking, but let's see where the money comes
from." Weiner said the plan's sponsors had yet to say how they would fund
the program and that the proposed allocation did not take into account that
the administration had increased funding for interdiction by 9 percent in
the past year.

<P>

DeWine said a large, quick infusion of money is necessary because Pentagon
funding for interdiction operations dropped by 57 percent from 1992 to 1995
- -- $505 million to $215 million. &nbsp;During the same time, he said, the Coast
Guard's interdiction budget shrank from $444 million to $301 million. &nbsp;As a
result, DeWine and <B>McCollum</B> said, there are no radar systems to monitor
planes carrying cargoes of illegal drugs and no interdiction capabilities
along the Pacific coast from Peru to California.

<P>

"There is not a ship, not a plane out there," <B>McCollum</B> said.

<P>

Of the proposed expenditures, $580 million would be used to buy 20 P-3B
early-warning aircraft, and $300 million would be allocated to build a U.S.
military base at a site in Latin America that has not yet been selected.
The new outpost would replace U.S. &nbsp;bases that are being closed in Panama as
a result of the Panama Canal Treaty, which calls for all U.S. &nbsp;property
there to be turned over to Panama by the end of next year. &nbsp;An additional
$289 million would pay for six new Coast Guard patrol vessels.

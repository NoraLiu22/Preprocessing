    <td bgcolor="#99CCCC">"Tuberculosis" is a relatively modern name (first
appearing in print in the 1840s) for a very old disease.&nbsp; It comes
from the Latin word, <i>tuberculum</i>, meaning "protuberance, projection
or growth," and refers to the tumor-like nodules that victims often display.&nbsp;
In fact, until TB's bacterial agent was discovered in 1882, many physicians
thought TB's characteristic nodules and wasting identified it as a form
of cancer.
<p>Patients suffering from TB exhibited many symptoms:&nbsp;
evening fever, night sweats, blood spitting, weak pulse, diarrhea....&nbsp;
But the symptom that left the strongest impression was emaciation.&nbsp;
It is this characteristic that formed the basis of TB's many names:
<ul>
<li>
"Phthisis" (pronounced TIE-sis, or THIGH-sis) from
the Greek word <i>phthiein</i>, meaning "to waste away."&nbsp; Hippocrates
used this term to describe the wasting and melting away of a patient's
body caused by disease of the lungs.&nbsp; Many patients diagnosed with
phthisis were probably victims of tuberculosis.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">"Tabes" (pronounced TAY-beez) from the Latin word
<i>tabere</i>, meaning "to waste away."&nbsp; Tabes was used to describe
the wasting effects of many diseases from syphilis to cancer.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">"Consumption" from the Latin word <i>consumere</i>,
meaning "to use up, eat, or waste."&nbsp; This vivid term became a popular
way to describe the condition of tuberculous patients.</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000">With the advent of firsthand anatomical study and
autopsy in the Renaissance, physicians found that the wasting of phthisis
was always associated with curious lesions in the inner organs.&nbsp; They
called these nodules "tubercles."</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Tubercles varied in their consistency.&nbsp; They
could be as hard as cartilage and bone, or crumbly like chalk.&nbsp; In
some cases, they were found to be filled with pus having the consistency
of cheese or honey.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">As anatomical information grew, so did physicians'
questions about tubercles:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">How do tubercles arise?</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Are they present already in the body and just get
damaged and enlarged by disease?</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Or, are they new features formed by the disease?</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Are all of these different forms of tubercles related?</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Or, are they manifestations of completely different
kinds of disease (like the spots of measles, chickenpox, smallpox, syphilis....)</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000">Like Alzheimer's today, the internal physical effects
of developing TB could only be studied after the victim's death.</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">This changed with the introduction of two new
diagnostic procedures:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000"><b>percussion</b> (1761) by Austrian, <b>Leopold
von Auenbrugger (1722-1809)</b>, who noticed that tapping the thorax produces
different sounds depending on the location being struck; von Auenbrugger
learned to interpret the tones produced by <b>striking the chest with massed
tips of the fingers</b>; he used this method to detect fluid and other
matter in the lungs.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000"><b>indirect auscultation</b> (1816) by French-born,
<b>Ren&eacute; La&euml;nnec (1781-1826)</b>, who found that direct <i>auscultation</i>
(listening to internal bodily sounds by putting one's ear directly on a
patient's chest) was problematic, especially when treating a female patient,
or one infested with vermin; La&euml;nnec rolled up a card and discovered
he could hear the sounds better than by direct auscultation; he improved
on this simple concept and named the new instrument the <b>stethoscope</b>,
from the Greek words <i>stethos</i>, meaning "chest," and <i>skopein</i>,
meaning "to see."</font></li>

<br><b><font size=+1>"The Awakening"</font></b>

<br><b><em>How the Other Half Lives</em></b>
<br>
by Jacob Riis</center>

<p>THE dread of advancing cholera, with the guilty knowledge of the harvest
field that awaited the plague in New York's slums, pricked the conscience
of the community into action soon after the close of the war.&nbsp; A citizens'
movement resulted in the organization of a Board of Health and the adoption
of the "Tenement-House Act" of 1867, the first step toward remedial legislation.
<p>A thorough canvass of the tenements had been begun already in the previous
year; but the cholera first, and next a scourge of small-pox, delayed the
work, while emphasizing the need of it, so that it was 1869 before it got
fairly under way and began to tell.
<p>The dark bedroom fell under the ban first.&nbsp; In that year the Board
ordered the cutting of more than forty-six thousand windows in interior
rooms, chiefly for ventilation--for little or no light was to be had from
the dark hallways.&nbsp; Air-shafts were unknown.
<p>The saw had a job all that summer; by early fall nearly all the orders
had been carried out.&nbsp; Not without opposition; obstacles were thrown
in the way of the officials on the one side by the owners of the tenements,
who saw in every order to repair or clean up only an item of added expense
to diminish their income from the rent; on the other side by the tenants
themselves, who had sunk, after a generation of unavailing protest, to
the level of their surroundings, and were at last content to remain there.&nbsp;
The tenements had bred their Nemesis, a proletariat ready and able to avenge
the wrongs of their crowds. Already it taxed the city heavily for the support
of its jails and charities.
<p>The basis of opposition, curiously enough was the same at both extremes;
owner and tenant alike considered official interference an infringement
of personal rights, and a hardship.&nbsp; It took long years of weary labor
to make good the claim of the sunlight to such corners of the dens as it
could reach at all.&nbsp; Not until five years after did the department
succeed at last in ousting the "cave-dwellers" and closing some five hundred
and fifty cellars south of Houston Street, many of them below tide-water,
that had been used as living apartments.&nbsp; In many instances the police
had to drag the tenants out by force.
<p>The work went on; but the need of it only grew with the effort.&nbsp;
The Sanitarians were following up an evil that grew faster than they went;
like a fire, it could only be headed off, not chased, with success.&nbsp;
Official reports, read in the churches in 1879, characterized the younger
criminals as Victims of low social conditions of life and unhealthy, overcrowded
lodgings, brought up in "an atmosphere of actual darkness, moral and physical."
<p>This after the saw had been busy in the dark corners ten years!
<p>"If we could see the air breathed by these poor creatures in their tenements,"
said a well-known physician, "it would show itself to be fouler than the
mud of the gutters."&nbsp; Little improvement was apparent despite all
that had been done.&nbsp; "The new tenements, that have been recently built,
have been usually as badly planned as the old, with dark and unhealthy
rooms, often over wet cellars, where extreme overcrowding is permitted,"
was the verdict of one authority.&nbsp; These are the houses that to-day
perpetuate the worst traditions of the past, and they are counted by thousands.
<p>The Five Points had been cleansed, as far as the immediate neighborhood
was concerned, but the Mulberry Street Bend was fast outdoing it in foulness
not a stone's threw away, and new centres of corruption were continually
springing up and getting the upper hand whenever vigilance was relaxed
for ever so short a time.&nbsp; It is one of the curses of the tenement-house
system that the worst houses exercise a levelling influence upon all the
rest, just as one bad boy in a schoolroom will spoil the whole class.&nbsp;
It is one of the ways the evil that was "the result of forgetfulness of
the poor," as the Council of Hygiene mildly put it, has of avenging itself.
<p>The determined effort to head it off by laying a strong hand upon the
tenement builders that has been the chief business of the Health Board
of recent years, dates from this period.&nbsp; The era of the air-shaft
has not solved the problem of housing the poor, but it has made good use
of limited opportunities.&nbsp; Over the new houses sanitary law exercises
full control.&nbsp; But the old remain.&nbsp; They cannot be summarily
torn down, though in extreme cases the authorities can order them cleared.&nbsp;
The outrageous overcrowding, too, remains.&nbsp; It is characteristic of
the tenements.&nbsp; Poverty, their badge and typical condition, invites--compels
it.&nbsp; All efforts to abate it result only in temporary relief.&nbsp;
As long as they exist it will exist with them.&nbsp; And the tenements
will exist in New York forever.
<p>To-day, what is a tenement?&nbsp; The law defines it as a house "occupied
by three or more families, living independently and doing their cooking
on the premises; or by more than two families on a door, so living and
cooking and having a common right in the halls, stairways, yards, etc."&nbsp;
That is the legal meaning, and includes flats and apartment-houses, with
which we have nothing to do.&nbsp; In its narrower sense the typical tenement
was thus described when last arraigned before the bar of public justice:&nbsp;
"It is generally a brick building from four to six stories high on the
street, frequently with a store on the first floor which, when used for
the sale of liquor, has a side opening for the benefit of the inmates and
to evade the Sunday law; four families occupy each floor, and a set of
rooms consists of one or two dark closets, used as bedrooms, with a living
room twelve feet by ten.&nbsp; The staircase is too often a dark well in
the centre of the house, and no direct through ventilation is possible,
each family being separated from the other by partitions.&nbsp; Frequently
the rear of the lot is occupied by another building of three stories high
with two families on a floor."
<p>The picture is nearly as true to-day as ten years ago, and will be for
a long time to come.&nbsp; The dim light admitted by the air-shaft shines
upon greater crowds than ever.&nbsp; Tenements are still "good property,"
and the poverty of the poor man his destruction.&nbsp; A barrack down town
where he has to live because he is poor brings in a third more rent than
a decent flat house in Harlem.
<p>The statement once made a sensation that between seventy and eighty
children had been found in one tenement.&nbsp; It no longer excites even
passing attention, when the sanitary police report counting 101 adults
and 91 children in a Crosby Street house, one of twins, built together.&nbsp;
The children in the other, if I am not mistaken, numbered 89, a total of
180 for two tenements!&nbsp; Or when a midnight inspection in Mulberry
Street unearths a hundred and fifty "lodgers" sleeping on filthy floors
in two buildings.&nbsp; Spite of brown-stone trimmings, plate-glass and
mosaic vestibule floors, the water does not rise in summer to the second
story, while the beer flows unchecked to the all-night picnics on the roof.&nbsp;
The saloon with the side-door and the landlord divide the prosperity of
the place between them, and the tenant, in sullen submission, foots the
bills.
<p>Where are the tenements of to-day?&nbsp; Say rather: where are they
not?&nbsp; In fifty years they have crept up from the Fourth Ward slums
and the Five Points the whole length of the island, and have polluted the
Annexed District to the Westchester line.&nbsp; Crowding all the lower
wards, wherever business leaves a foot of ground unclaimed; strung along
both rivers, like ball and chain tied to the foot of every street, and
filling up Harlem with their restless, pent-up multitudes, they hold within
their clutch the wealth and business of New York, hold them at their mercy
in the day of mob-rule and wrath.&nbsp; The bullet-proof shutters, the
stacks of hand-grenades, and the Gatling guns of the Sub-Treasury are tacit
admissions of the fact and of the quality of the mercy expected.
<p>The tenements to-day are New York, harboring three-fourths of its population.&nbsp;
When another generation shall have doubled the census of our city, and
to that vast army of workers, held captive by poverty, the very name of
home shall be as a bitter mockery, what will the harvest be?</td>

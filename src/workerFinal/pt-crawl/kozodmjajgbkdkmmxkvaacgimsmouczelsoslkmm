NOTICE: We are no longer stocking these CDs.
</FONT>
The CD-ROMs contained the exact same content that you are seeing on this web site.  When the WW2010 web site was first developed, we realized that many educators did not have adequate access to the internet, and thus offered a CD-ROM version of the content (which was still in the form of web pages, except that the files were on the CD instead of online).  However, things have changed, and CD orderes have greatly diminished due to improved internet access. Additionally, the content on this site has not been significantly updated since 1999 (though it remains useful to some extent).

<p>
The Department of Atmospheric Sciences (DAS) at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) would like to announce the release of the 2nd edition 
of the Weather World 2010 (WW2010) Educational CD-ROM. This resource is being
constructed to provide local access to the high-graphics version our entire
collection of Internet-based educational resources developed through our
participation in NSF's Collaborative Visualization Project (CoVis).  Most
of these resources are currently available in the 
<A HREF="/(Gh)/guides/home.rxml" >Online Guides</A>.

<p><b>New to the 2nd Edition of the WW2010 CD-ROM:</b>
<BR><i>As seen on the web</i>
<ul>
<li>A Completely new <A HREF="/(Gh)/wwhlpr/hurr_graphic.rxml?hret=/guides/mtr/hyd/home.rxml&prv=1" >Hurricane</A> instructional module filled with new graphics and movies.
<li>New <A HREF="/(Gh)/wwhlpr/modl_graphic.rxml?hret=/guides/mtr/hyd/home.rxml&prv=1" >Modeling</A> section to the Severe Storms instructional module including movies, animations, research results, and online access to streaming video.
<li>New pages in the <A HREF="/(Gh)/wwhlpr/fw_graphic.rxml?hret=/guides/mtr/hyd/home.rxml&prv=1" >Forces and Winds</A> 
instructional module.
<li>Updates to the <A HREF="/(Gh)/wwhlpr/satellites_graphic.rxml?hret=/guides/mtr/hyd/home.rxml&prv=1" >Satellite</A> and <A HREF="/(Gh)/wwhlpr/opt_graphic.rxml?hret=/guides/mtr/hyd/home.rxml&prv=1" >Light & Optics</A> instructional modules.
<li>New pages describing WW2010 Current weather products.
<li>Plus many other updates and revisions to other instructional 
modules and background pages.
</ul>

<p><b>Features of the CD-ROM will include:</b>

<p><A HREF="/(Gh)/guides/mtr/home.rxml" >INSTRUCTIONAL MODULES</A> - 
that use multimedia and the flexible nature of the
web to enhance the impact of educational resources.   
These modules introduce and explain fundamental topics in
Meteorology 
(Pressure, Severe Storms, El  Ni&ntilde;o, Forecasting etc.), Remote
Sensing (Radars and Satellites) and how some of these aspects fit into the
Hydrologic Cycle. 

<BR>NOTE: The only resources found online and not on the CD-ROM are the 
Tropical Cyclone tracker and 3-D VRML Hurricane. They will still be 
accessible online from the CD-ROM.

<p><A HREF="/(Gh)/arch/cases/home.rxml" >ARCHIVED WEATHER DATA</A> - 
and case studies of memorable weather events like
Hurricane Andrew, Storm of the Century and the April 19, 1996 Illinois
Tornado Outbreak.  Each case contains relevant weather images, storm
histories, photographs and eye-witness accounts.

<p><A HREF="/(Gh)/guides/crclm/act/home.rxml" >STUDENT PROJECTS & ACTIVITIES</A> - 
(complete with answer keys) that provide
teachers with a meaningful way of integrating the data and instructional
resources into the classroom.

<p>
<A HREF="/(Gh)/wx/home.rxml" >REAL-TIME WEATHER DATA</A> - 
will also be accessible from selected pages of the
CD-ROM to allow the user to apply what they've learned to current weather
conditions.  These pages will link to relevant weather products accessible
through our WW2010 web server.

<p>
<A HREF="/(Gh)/wwhlpr/about_navigation.rxml?hret=/guides/mtr/hyd/home.rxml&prv=1" >EFFICIENT NAVIGATION</A> - 
that allows users to move between hundreds of pages
with only a few clicks and return easily.


<p>
These resources will be accessible from the CD-ROM by 
using any standard web browser and the interface will be nearly 
identical to their online counterparts. Therefore 
the same CD-ROM can be used on a Macintosh or an PC.

</center>
...The Wiroans with whom we dwelt called Wingina, and many of his people
would bee glad many times to be with us at our Prayers, and many times
call upon us both in his owne towne, as also in others whither bee sometimes
accompanied us, to pray and sing Psalmes, hoping thereby to be partaker
of the same effects which we by that meanes also expected.
<p>Twise this Winoans was so grievously sicke that he was like to die,
and as he lay languishing, doubting of any helpe by his owne priestes,
and thinking hee was in such danger for offending us and thereby our God,
sent for some of us to pray and bee a meanes to our God that it would please
him either that he might live, or after death dwell with him in blisse,
so likewise were the requests of many others in the like case.
<p>On a time also when their come began to wither by reason of a drought
which happened extraordinarily, fearing that it had come to passe by reason
that in some thing they had displeased us, many would come to us and desire
us to pray to our God of England, that he would preserve their Corne, promising
that when it was ripe we also should be partakers of the fruit.
<p>There could at no time happen any strange sicknesse, losses, hurts,
or any other crosse unto them, but that they would impute to us the cause
or meanes thereof, for offending or not pleasing us.&nbsp; One other rare
and strange accident, leaving others, wil I mention before I end, which
moved the whole Countrey that either knew or heard of us, to have us in
wonderfull admiration.
<p>There was no towne where wee had any subtile devise practised against
us, wee leaving it unpunished or not revenged (because we sought by all
meanes possible to win them by gentlenesse) but that within a few dayes
after our departure from every such Towne, the people began to die very
fast, and many in short space, in some Townes about twentie, in some fourtie,
and in one sixe score, which in trueth was very many in respect of their
numbers.&nbsp; This happened in no place that we could learne, but where
we had bin, where they used some practise against us, &amp; after such
time.&nbsp; The disease also was so strange, that they neither knewe what
it was, nor how to cure it, the like by report of the oldest men in the
Countrey never happened before, time out of minde.&nbsp; A thing specially
observed by us, as also by the naturall inhabitants themselves.&nbsp; Insomuch
that when some of the inhabitants which were our friends, and especially
the Wiroans Wingina, had observed such effects in foure or five Townes
to followe their wicked practises, they were perswaded that it was the
worke of our God through our meanes, and that we by him might kill and
slay whom we would without weapons, and not come neere them.&nbsp; And
thereupon when it had happened that they had understanding that any of
their enemies had abused us in our journeys, hearing that we had wrought
no revenge with our weapons, and fearing upon some cause the matter should
so rest:&nbsp; did come and intreate us that we would be a meanes to our
God that they as others that had dealt ill with us might in like sort die,
alleadging how much it would bee for our credite and profite, as also theirs,
and hoping furthermore that we would doe so much at their requests in respect
of the friendship we professed them.
<p>Whose entreaties although wee shewed that they were ungodly, affirming
that our God would not subject himselfe to any such prayers and requests
of men: that indeede all things have bene and were to be done according
to his good pleasure as he had ordeined:&nbsp; and that we to shewe our
selves his true servants ought rather to make petition for the contrary,
that they with them might five together with us, be made partakers of his
trueth, and serve him in righteousnesse, but notwithstanding in such sort,
that wee referre that, as all other things, to bee done according to his
divine will and pleasure, and as by his wisedome he had ordeined to be
best.
<p>Yet because the effect fell out so suddenly and shortly after according
to their desires, they thought neverthelesse it came to passe by our meanes,
&amp; that we in using such speeches unto them, did but dissemble the matter,
and therefore came unto us to give us thankes in their maner, that although
we satisfied them not in promise, yet in deedes and effect we had fulfilled
their desires.
<p>This marveilous accident in all the Countrey wrought so strange opinions
of us, that some people could not tell whether to thinke us gods or men,
and the rather because that all the space of their sicknes, there was no
man of ours knowen to die, or that was specially sicke:&nbsp; they noted
also that we had no women amongst us, neither that we did care for any
of theirs.
<p>Some therefore were of opinion that we were not borne of women, and
therefore not mortal, but that we were men of an old generation many yeeres
past, then risen againe to immortalitie.
<p>Some would likewise seeme to prophecie that there were more of our generation
yet to come to kill theirs and take their places, as some thought the purpose
was, by that which was already done.&nbsp; Those that were immediately
to come after us they imagined to be in the aire, yet invisible and without
bodies, and that they by our intreatie and for the love of us, did make
the people to die in that sort as they did, by shooting invisible bullets
into them.
<p>To confirme this opinion, their Phisitions (to excuse their ignorance
in curing the disease) would not be ashamed to say, but earnestly make
the simple people beleeve, that the strings of blood that they sucked out
of the sicke bodies, were the strings wherewithall the invisible bullets
were tied and cast.&nbsp; Some also thought that wee shot them our selves
out of our pieces, from the place where wee dwelt, and killed the people
in any Towne that had offended us, as wee listed, howe farre distant from
us soever it were.&nbsp; And other some said, that it was the speciall
worke of God for our sakes, as we our selves have cause in some sort to
thinke no lesse, whatsoever some doe, or may imagine to the contrary, specially
some Astrologers, knowing of the Eclipse of the Sunne which we saw the
same yeere before in our voyage thitherward, which unto them appeared very
terrible.&nbsp; And also of a Comet which began to appeare but a fewe dayes
before the beginning of the saide sicknesse.&nbsp; But to exclude them
from being the speciall causes of so speciall an accident, there are further
reasons then I thinke fit at this present to be alleadged.&nbsp; These
their opinions I have set downe the more at large, that it may appeare
unto you that there is good hope they may be brought through discreete
dealing and government to the imbracing of the trueth, and consequently
to honour, obey, feare and love us.
<p>And although some of our company towards the end of the yeere, shewed
themselves too fierce in slaying some of the people in some Townes, upon
causes that on our part might easily ynough have bene borne withall: yet
notwithstanding, because it was on their part justly deserved, the alteration
of their opinions generally and for the most part concerning us is the
lesse to be doubted.&nbsp; And whatsoever els they may be, by carefulnesse
of our selves neede nothing at all to be feared....
<p><center>
<i>The Conclusion</i></center>
...For the holsomnesse thereeof I neede to say but thus much:&nbsp; that
for all the want of provision, as first of English victuall, excepting
for twentie dayes, we lived onely by drinking water, and by the victuall
of the Countrey, of which some sorts were very strange unto us, and might
have been thought to have altered our temperatures in such sort, as to
have brought us into some grievous and dangerous diseases:&nbsp; Secondly
the want of English meanes, for the taking of beastes, fish and foule,
which by the helpe only of the inhabitants and their meanes could not bee
so suddenly and easily provided for us, nor in so great number and quantities,
nor of that choise as otherwise might have bene to our better satisfaction
and contentment.&nbsp; Some want also we had of clothes.&nbsp; Furthermore
in al our travailes, which were most specially and often in the time of
Winter, our lodging was in the open aire upon the ground.&nbsp; And yet
I say for all this, there were but foure of our whole company (being one
hundreth and eight) that died all the yeere, and that but at the latter
ende thereof, and upon none of the aforesaide causes.&nbsp; For all foure,
especially three, were feeble, weake, and sickly persons before ever they
came thither, and those that knew them, much marveled that they lived so
long being in that case, or had adventured to travaile.</td>

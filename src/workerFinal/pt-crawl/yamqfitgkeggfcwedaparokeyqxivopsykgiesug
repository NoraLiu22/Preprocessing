/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

          of the book <u>Les Polyn&eacute;siens et leurs Migrations</u> by Armand 
          de Quatrefages de Br&eacute;au. It was printed in Volume 4 of the <u>Quarterly

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 161]]</font> The origin 
          of the various races of the islands of the Pacific has always been one 
          of the most difficult problems for the believers in the unity and the 
          recent origin of man. Their diversity of physical features, of civilization, 
          and of language, the absence of any continental races to which they 
          could be affiliated, and the wide spaces of ocean over which they are 
          distributed, have hitherto seemed to indicate that their origin dates 
          from a period so remote that we cannot hope to determine it with any 
          approach to certainty. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M. Quatrefages, however, an eminent anthropologist, 
          has courageously attempted to solve the enigma of the origin of the 
          Polynesians, the most important of the Pacific races. He very properly 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 162]]</font> limits this term to the brown 
          races spread over a wide area from the Sandwich Islands in the north 
          to New Zealand on the south, and from Easter Island on the east to the 
          Tonga and Samoan groups on the west, but all speaking dialects of one 
          well-marked language. Now what M. Quatrefages attempts to prove is, 
          that these people are simply Malays, who migrated from some islands 
          of the Malayan Archipelago (probably Bouru in the Moluccas), and have 
          more or less intermingled with the races of Melanesia and Micronesia. 
          His evidence to prove this is of two kinds:--first, he endeavours to 
          show that a migration has taken place; secondly, that the Polynesians 
          are in their physical, mental, and moral characteristics, a true Malayan 
          race. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <i>Migrations.</i>--We find in M. Quatrefages' 
          volume a very careful summary of all the native accounts of their migrations, 
          and also of the involuntary migrations that have recently occurred. 
          These, no doubt, prove that the Sandwich Islands and New Zealand have 
          been peopled by emigrants from the Marquesas and Tahiti, and the fact 
          of this emigration is confirmed by the independent evidence of language. 
          It is proved, therefore, that the Polynesians have passed over immense 
          spaces of ocean, in directions not especially favoured by winds or currents, 
          and thus the difficulty of any migration, merely from its distance, 
          is quite overcome. It is further shown that all the traditions point 
          to the Samoan group and the Fiji Islands as the central points to which 
          almost all Polynesians trace their origin. It is to be observed here 
          that these are the largest of all the islands in the central Pacific 
          inhabited by the Polynesian race, and it is these, therefore, that we 
          should naturally expect to have sent out colonies to the smaller islands. 
          So far we have the strongest corroboration of there having actually 
          been a migration in the fact of the community of language, and all the 
          legends of these migrations speak of them as having been made by simple 
          men, the natural ancestors of the existing Polynesians. But in the legend 
          which refers the origin of the Samoans themselves to a migration from 
          a large country &quot;further west,&quot; we get into pure legend,--for the mythic 
          Boulotou, whence the first inhabitants are said to have come, is a spiritual 
          and not a real country, and these inhabitants are believed to have been 
          not men, but inferior gods. And even the direct evidence of migration 
          having been generally from the west, is by no means so clear as M. Quatrefages 
          appears to believe; for one of the latest authorities on the subject, 
          Mr. W. T. Pritchard, who has spent his whole life in the Pacific, and 
          who from his long residence in the Fiji and Samoan Islands as British 
          Consul, and his intimate knowledge of the Polynesian languages, is well 
          qualified to give an opinion on this matter, says it is just the contrary. 
          In his 'Polynesian Reminiscences,' p. 402, he observes: &quot;It is, however, 
          remarkable that in all these many instances of authenticated driftings, 
          the course of the <font color="990000">[[p. 163]]</font> drifted canoes 
          has been <i>from east to west</i>, before the prevailing trade winds, 
          and <i>not from west to east</i> before the westerly winds;&quot; during 
          the prevalence of which he tells us the natives do not usually venture 
          out on fishing or travelling expeditions. In this case, too, the corroborative 
          proof by language completely fails, for though there is an undoubted 
          Malay element in the Polynesian language, it is an element derived from 
          the civilized Malay and Javanese tongues, not from those of the Moluccas, 
          which are totally distinct. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to be noted also that this Malay element in 

          the language has all the character of a recent introduction, since the 

          Malay words are hardly changed, except by the phonetic character of 

          the language which has received them.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <i>Physical Characters</i>.--The Malayan origin 

          of the Polynesians at a comparatively recent date implies much physical 

          similarity; for even if the Malay formed a still larger portion of the 

          Polynesian language than it does, this would not prove a community of 

          race, unless the physical characters also in some degree corresponded. 

          It is here that we find an absolute defect of all evidence bearing upon 

          the point in question--the similarity of the Polynesians to any race 

          speaking the Malay language. Almost the only evidence adduced by M. 

          Quatrefages goes to show the similarity of the brown race of Timor to 

          those of Polynesia. But the Timorese are not Malays at all; they belong 

          to that curious race which has close affinities to the Papuan in all 

          moral and physical characteristics except colour, and their languages 

          are much further removed from the Malay than even the Polynesian itself. 

          The resemblance physically of this race with the Polynesian proves absolutely 

          nothing with regard to the Malay question.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let us compare the most important and thoroughly 

          well-established physical and mental characteristics of the two races:--

        </p><blockquote><font size="-1"><i>Polynesians</i>: Tall, averaging 5 ft. 10 

          in., per Wilkes (Samoans), or 6 ft., per Dupurey (Tahitians); hair wavy, 

          curly, or frizzly; beard often full; face handsome, European type; nose 

          often aquiline; disposition active and joyous; character open and frank; 

          often erected stone edifices; use double canoes.</font> 

          <p><font size="-1"><i>Malays</i>: Short, 5 ft. 4 in. or 5 ft. 6 in.; hair 

            always straight; beard scanty or none; face never of European type; 

            nose never aquiline; disposition slow and morose; character eminently 

            secretive; never used stone for building; use single canoes.</font>

        </p></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the following passages from Consul Hopkins' recent 

        work on Hawai, the italicized passages show points in which the Polynesian 

        is the exact opposite of the Malay:-- 

        <blockquote><font size="-1">&quot;The hair of the Hawaians is black or <i>brown</i>, 

          strong, and frequently <i>curly</i>.&quot;</font> 

          <p><font size="-1" color="990000">[[p. 164]]</font><font size="-1"> &quot;The 
            Hawaians are strong, well-made, and active, in height rather <i>above 
            the average of Englishmen</i> . . . The Hawaians possess the virtue 
            of <i>courage in an unquestionably high degree. . . . </i>They are 
            now as peaceful a people as any upon earth; they are more <i>free 
            from crimes of violence</i> than any nation that can be named . . 
            . The natural disposition of the Hawaians is everything that is <i>opposite 
            to the gloomy and morose</i>. The pleasant universal '<i>aloha</i>' 
            or salutation, the <i>merry ringing laughter</i> of the women wherever 
            found, proclaim the people to be a <i>light-hearted race</i>.&quot;</font> 
        </p></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking the whole of these differences, they appear 

        to indicate a radical diversity of race, not to be overcome by any mere 

        similarity of colour and some common words in language, which is all that 

        really exists to prove identity of race. The one single fact of stature 

        is conclusive against any such comparatively recent common origin as M. 

        Quatrefages argues for. A race which averages 5 ft. 10 in., and has many 

        men 6 ft. 2 in. or more, can hardly have been derived, at such a recent 

        period as to have retained community of language, from a race averaging 

        5 ft. 5 in. or 5 ft. 6 in., and among whom a single individual of 5 ft. 

        10 in. is rarely, perhaps never, found. Again the hair of the Malay is 

        of the true Mongol type--black, coarse, and perfectly straight. The least 

        approach to wavy or curly hair is never found among the unmixed Malay. 

        I cannot find evidence that the Polynesians <i>ever</i> have this character 

        of hair, while it is undoubtedly often as frizzly as the most decided 

        Papuan. Again, the mental character of two races in a parallel state of 

        civilization and inhabiting very similar countries, is surely of great 

        importance; yet, what contrast can be greater than between the phlegmatic, 

        suspicious, undemonstrative Malay, and active, frank, and joyous Tahitian? 

        Are we to throw down all these barriers of diversity for the sake of solving 

        by main force a problem that is probably insoluble? 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. <i>Geological and Zoological Evidence</i>.--M. 

          Quatrefages dismisses with a very brief notice the proofs of a former 

          much greater extent of land in the Polynesian area than now exists. 

          These proofs are of two kinds: first, the existence of numerous groups 

          of coral islands, which are admitted to indicate sunken land; and secondly, 

          the distribution of animals in the existing islands. That coral reefs 

          and atolls are proofs of subsidence of the land, has never been seriously 

          denied since Darwin's work on Coral Reefs was published; and as immense 

          areas of the Pacific are occupied by such coral islands alternating 

          with volcanic groups and such as show signs of elevation, it is only 

          a question of time as to whether man could have inhabited these sunken 

          lands.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we form any notion how long it is since the 
          Pacific lands have disappeared? This can perhaps be approximately determined 
          by the existing distribution of animals in these islands. The only <font color="990000">[[p. 
          165]]</font> group we yet know with any approach to completeness are 
          the Birds; and though these may not be supposed to be the best adapted 
          to test a question of this kind, yet ornithologists know that a very 
          moderate extent of ocean practically limits the range of most land birds. 
          The total number of species found in any of these islands is very small. 
          For example, if we exclude the waders, swimmers, and birds of prey as 
          having roving habits and great powers of flight, we find that according 
          to the best information only twenty-two species of land birds inhabit 
          the group of the Society Islands, and of these seven are found in other 
          groups ranging as far as the Marquesas, the Fiji Islands, and even to 
          the Sandwich Islands. These are almost all birds of moderate powers 
          of flight and such as inhabit the forests and mountains, and do not 
          generally range far. In Mr. G. R. Gray's list of the birds of the Pacific 
          Islands I find eleven species of the genera <i>Myzomela</i>, <i>Meliphaga</i>, 
          <i>Tatare</i>, <i>Monarcha</i>, <i>Coriphilus</i>, <i>Eudynamis</i>, 
          and <i>Ptilonopus</i>, which are known from two or more of the distinct 
          and well separated groups of islands in the central Pacific, and some 
          of them have a very wide range. Among these are two very distinct genera, 
          <i>Tatare</i> and <i>Coriphilus</i>, which are entirely confined to 
          the Polynesian area. Now these facts would certainly indicate a more 
          intimate connection of the various groups of islands within the period 
          of living species, and therefore within the human period, than now exists. 
          The phenomena presented by the distribution of man are thus to some 
          extent reproduced by the distribution of land-birds in the same area, 
          and entitle us to believe that the subsidence of land indicated by coral 
          reefs took place since man inhabited the earth. This subsidence was 
          probably coincident with, perhaps caused by, the elevation of the existing 
          volcanic islands; and while man and birds were able to migrate to these, 
          the mammalia dwindled away and finally perished, when the last mountain-top 
          of the old Pacific land sank beneath the Ocean. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This hypothesis is one which does not outrage nature, 
          as does that of the direct and recent derivation of the Polynesians 
          from the Malays. It harmonizes at once with the Geological, the Zoological, 
          and the Anthropological phenomena; and if it is held that the facts 
          are not sufficient to prove it, or that even if proved it only removes 
          the origin of the race in question one step further back into the obscurity 
          of the past, it may be suggested that in a case of such admitted difficulty 
          we can hardly do more. We ought not to expect that the beginnings of 
          every race are to be discovered within the short epoch of human history 
          or tradition, and we have every reason to be suspicious of the theory 
          that professes such a discovery. In the present case, the very erroneous 
          views prevalent on the subject arise from two causes. One is the occurrence 
          of a number of Malay words in the Polynesian language; the other, the 
          similarity of the brown tint of the Malays and Polynesians, <font color="990000">[[p. 
          166]]</font> while they are separated by a group of people of a much 
          darker colour. The similarity of tint has led many travellers in the 
          one area to jump to the conclusion that the people of the other area, 
          of which they have little knowledge, are the same race. It unfortunately 
          happens that not a single traveller appears to be well acquainted with 
          both races, and for that reason their opinions as to the similarity 
          of the two should be received with great doubt. If, on the contrary, 
          my account of the physical and mental characteristics of the Malays 
          be taken as correct (and I resided among them for eight years), and 
          if it be compared with that of the Polynesians given by Cook, and by 
          recent travellers and missionaries, the differences will be seen to 
          be so striking and radical, that all idea of their being the same race 
          must be given up. In the case of the Malays in particular, much confusion 
          has arisen from travellers having confounded with them the many peoples 
          of distinct race which inhabit the eastern parts of the Malayan Archipelago, 
          such as the Timorese, the mountaineers of Ceram and Gilolo, and of the 
          small islands near New Guinea; and this mistake has been rendered excusable 
          by the number of half-breeds between the two races to be found everywhere. 
          Many of these people are, perhaps, allied to the Polynesians,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
          but they are certainly not Malays, who are essentially a Mongol race, 
          with many of the Mongol characteristics very strongly marked. The Papuans 
          of New Guinea form the extreme type of another and a widely different 
          race, and all the evidence goes to show that in every characteristic 
          except colour, the Polynesians are nearer to the Papuans than they are 
          to the Malays, although it is not improbable that they are equally distinct 
          from both.</p>

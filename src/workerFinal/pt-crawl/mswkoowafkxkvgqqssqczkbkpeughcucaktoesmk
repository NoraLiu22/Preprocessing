/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        237]] </font>Sixteen years ago the author of this book, then American 
        Minister at Naples, spent the evening of the 25th of March at the house 
        of the Russian Minister, Mons. K__, in the company of several visitors 
        from different parts of the world, among whom were the Chevalier de F__ 
        (the Tuscan Minister) and his lady. Madame K__ introduced the subject 
        of automatic writing; and declared her conviction that some persons had 
        the power of thus replying correctly to questions, the true answers to 
        which were entirely unknown to them. It was proposed to try the experiment; 
        and each person present accordingly took pencil and paper, and waited 
        the result. After a few minutes one lady's hand began to move, making 
        irregular figures on the paper. Mr. Owen proposed that questions should 
        be asked; whereupon Madame de F__ said &quot;Who gave me these pins?&quot; pointing 
        to three gold-headed pins that fastened her dress; adding &quot;If Mrs. M__ 
        can answer that I shall believe.&quot; After a short time the lady's pencil 
        slowly wrote out--(the last two words being written backwards)--&quot;The one 
        that gives you a Maid and a Cook. E.&quot; Madame de F__ turned pale, and cried 
        &quot;Magic, if there be such a thing;&quot; and then told the company that the 
        pins had been given her by her cousin Elizabeth, who lived at Florence, 
        and who at her request had sent her, a few days before, a lady's maid 
        and a cook. Mr. Owen pondered over this strange occurrence, and determined 
        to get to the bottom of it. Mrs. M__ was not a Spiritualist. Madame de 
        F__ had only been a few weeks in Naples, had not mentioned even her cousin's 
        name to any one, and had the slightest possible acquaintance with Mrs. 
        M__, having only just exchanged cards with her. She expressed the strongest 
        conviction that the three or four facts, accurately stated in the few 
        words written, could not possibly have become known out of her own family. 
        Mr. Owen was then a complete sceptic; but this circumstance induced a 
        course of study which has been continued for fifteen years, and which 
        eventually changed the whole feelings and tenour of his life. He is now 
        a confirmed Spiritualist; that is, he not only believes the phenomena 
        to be real, but he has satisfied himself that they furnish a sufficient 
        proof of a future existence for man. Yet, it may surprise some of our 
        readers to hear, he is fully imbued with the spirit and teachings of modern 
        science; and his book is one continued protest against the miraculous. 
        He maintains that all these phenomena happen under law, just as much as 
        do the various phenomena (many of them still inexplicable by science) 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 238]]</font> presented by plants, animals, or 
        man. He treats this question seriously and dispassionately, as the great 
        question of the age; which he may well do, since he claims that it furnishes 
        an experimental proof of immortality. He writes with the earnestness suited 
        to such a theme, and with the sense of responsibility of one who, by long 
        and patient study, has arrived at important truths of the highest value 
        to his fellow men. Rationalism, he tells us, cannot object to this belief, 
        that it contravenes the doctrine of law; for its phenomena occur strictly 
        under law: nor yet that it assumes the existence, in spiritual matters, 
        of that direct agency of God which the naturalist finds nowhere in the 
        physical universe; for its revealings come to man mediately only: nor 
        yet that it is dogmatic, exclusive, or intolerant, as Infallibility is; 
        for its adherents adduce experimental evidence, open to all men, and gleaned 
        after the inductive method, for the faith that is in them. He shows us 
        how important it was for the welfare of man that the belief in such phenomena 
        should die out when it did, and leave us free to develope the doctrine 
        of law, and to overthrow the very idea of infallible or absolute truth 
        in matters of religion. All the horrors of witchcraft, and all the persecutions 
        of priests, arose from the dogma of infallibility; for if that dogma had 
        been true, persecution would not have been a crime, but a duty. The world 
        could not reach the fundamental truths of these phenomena, or understand 
        their real import, as long as they believed in the devil and in their 
        own infallibility. Now, they are able to investigate the phenomena calmly, 
        and reason upon them logically; and it is a suggestive fact that a large 
        proportion of investigators are persons untrammelled by dogmatic creeds, 
        and fully imbued with the teachings of modern science and philosophy. 
        Mr. Owen thinks that the belief in modern spiritualism is spreading as 
        fast as can be wished, and even faster than can be expected, considering 
        that almost every educated man is prejudiced against the very attempt 
        to investigate it. He well remarks, that the growth of any new-born hypothesis 
        so startling in character, resembles that of a human being. During its 
        infancy its suggestions carry small weight. It is listened to with a smile, 
        and set aside with little ceremony. Throughout its years of nonage it 
        may be said to have no rights of property, no privilege of appropriation. 
        Proofs in its favour may present themselves from time to time, but they 
        are not deemed entitled to a judgment, by the rules of evidence; they 
        are listened to as fresh and amusing, but they have no legal virtue; they 
        obtain no official record; they are not placed to the credit of the minor. 
        An adolescent hypothesis is held to be outside the limits of human justice.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best 
        features of the book, as a literary work, is the distinctness with which 
        each piece of evidence is presented, and the fulness and logical force 
        with which its teachings are discussed. This is so different from what 
        is usual when ghost <font color="990000">[[p. 239]]</font> stories are 
        narrated (the authors appearing afraid to contemplate the logical consequences 
        of a story they yet maintain to be true) that it will be well to give 
        a few of the cases in outline, with the author's summing up at length, 
        in order to see what a well-educated and highly-intelligent man can say 
        in favour of what is generally considered to be an exploded superstition. 
        Let us first take an old but well-authenticated story. Lord Erskine related 
        to Lady Morgan (herself a perfect sceptic) the following personal narrative. 
        On arriving at Edinburgh one morning, after a considerable absence from 
        Scotland, he met, in the street, his father's old butler, looking very 
        pale and wan. He asked him what brought him to Edinburgh. The butler replied, 
        &quot;To meet your honour, and solicit your interference with my Lord, to recover 
        a sum due to me, which the steward at the last settlement did not pay.&quot; 
        Lord Erskine then told the butler to step with him into a bookseller's 
        shop close by, but on turning round again he was not to be seen. Puzzled 
        at this he found out the man's wife, who lived in Edinburgh, when he learnt 
        for the first time that the butler was dead, and that he had told his 
        wife on his death-bed that the steward had wronged him of some money, 
        and that when Master Tom returned he would see her righted. This Lord 
        Erskine promised to do, and shortly afterwards kept his promise. Lady 
        Morgan then says, &quot;Either Lord Erskine did or did not believe this strange 
        story: if he did, what a strange aberration of intellect! if he did not, 
        what a stranger aberration from truth! My opinion is that he <em>did</em> 
        believe it.&quot; Probably hundreds of readers of this narrative by Lady Morgan 
        have said with her, &quot;What a strange aberration of intellect!&quot; and have 
        thought no more about the matter. Mr. Owen is not satisfied with this 
        careless mode of getting over a difficulty. His remarks are as follows: 
        &quot;What sort of mode to deal with alleged facts is this? A gentleman distinguished 
        in a profession of which the eminent members are the best judges of evidence 
        in the world--a gentleman whom the hearer believes to be truthful--relates 
        what, on a certain day, and in a certain place, both specified, he saw 
        and heard. What he saw was the appearance of one, in life well known to 
        him, who had been some months dead. What he heard, from the same source, 
        was a statement in regard to matters of which previously he had known 
        nothing whatever; which statement, on after enquiry, he learns to be strictly 
        true; a statement, too, which had occupied and interested the mind of 
        the deceased just before his decease. The natural inference from these 
        facts, if they are admitted, is that, under certain circumstances which 
        as yet we may be unable to define, those over whom the death change has 
        passed, still interested in the concerns of earth, may, for a time at 
        least, retain the power of occasional interference in these concerns; 
        for example, in an effort to right an injustice done. But rather than 
        admit such an inference--rather than accept disinterested evidence coming 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 240]]</font> from a witness acknowledged to 
        be sincere, and known to the world as eminently capable--a lady of the 
        world assumes to explain it away by summarily referring the whole to the 
        'dog-ears and folds of early impression!' What human testimony cannot 
        be set aside on the same vague and idle assumption? It is time we should 
        learn that the hypothesis of spiritual intervention is entitled to a fair 
        trial, and that, in conducting that trial, we have no right to disregard 
        the ordinary rules of evidence. Either Lord Erskine, one morning in Edinburgh, 
        issuing from a bookseller's shop, met what wore the appearance of an old 
        family servant who had been some months dead--or else Lord Erskine lied. 
        Either Lord Erskine heard words spoken, as if that appearance had spoken 
        them, which words contained a certain allegation touching business which 
        that servant, dying, had left unsettled--or else Lord Erskine lied. Either 
        Lord Erskine ascertained, by immediate personal interrogation of the widow, 
        that her husband, on his death-bed, had made the self-same allegation 
        to her which the apparition made to Lord Erskine--or else Lord Erskine 
        lied. Finally, either, as the result of this appearance and its speech, 
        a debt found due to the person whose counterpart it was, was actually 
        paid to his widow--or else Lord Erskine lied. But Lady Morgan expresses 
        her conviction that Lord Erskine did not lie.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In itself, the 
        thing was a trifle. Thousands on thousands of such cases of petty injustice 
        occur, and pass away unnoticed and unredressed. To the widow it was, undoubtedly, 
        of serious moment; but I think no sensible man will imagine it a matter 
        to justify the direct interference of God. If so, and if Lord Erskine 
        spoke truth, <em>an apparition is a natural phenomenon</em>.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is such evidence 
        as this refuted or explained away? Scores, and even hundreds, of equally 
        well attested facts are on record, but no attempt is ever made to explain 
        them. They are simply ignored, and, in many cases admitted to be inexplicable. 
        Yet this is not quite satisfactory, as any reader of Mr. Owen's book will 
        be inclined to admit. &quot;Punch&quot; once made a Yankee debtor say--</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;This debt I have repudiated 
          long ago;<br />
          'Tis therefore settled. Yet this Britisher<br />
          Keeps for repayment worriting me still!&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So our philosophers 
        declare that they have long ago decided these ghost stories to be all 
        delusion; <em>therefore</em> they need only be ignored; and they feel 
        much &quot;worrited&quot; that fresh evidence should be adduced and fresh converts 
        made, some of whom are so unreasonable as to ask for a new trial on the 
        ground that the former verdict was contrary to the evidence. Let us, however, 
        consider another case, the parties to which are intimately known to our 
        author, and whose character is vouched for as above suspicion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        241]</font> A young lady, Miss V., 
        while at her aunt's country mansion, was, owing to press of visitors, 
        asked to occupy a room believed to be haunted. Miss V. accepted it willingly, 
        being quite fearless. Awaking in the night, she saw in her room a woman 
        in old-fashioned dress, who, after a little while, came towards her, and 
        seemed to try in vain to speak. Miss V. became frightened, drew the clothes 
        over her face, and when she looked again the figure had disappeared. She 
        then jumped up, and found the door of her room locked on the inside. With 
        the light of day the impression somewhat faded; she began to think she 
        must have imagined or dreamt it, and in a short time thought no more of 
        the ghost. Some time afterwards Miss V. met with a friend interested in 
        spiritualism, and had with her several <em>s&eacute;ances</em>. At one 
        of them an alleged spirit announced herself as Sarah Clarke, a name unknown 
        to both ladies. A communication was then received to the effect that she 
        had many years ago been housekeeper in Miss V.'s family, and had vainly 
        endeavoured to communicate with the young lady while she was staying in 
        the old mansion; that her object was to confess a crime of which she had 
        been guilty, and to ask her old mistress's pardon for it. She had stolen 
        some family plate, and begged Miss V. to tell her aunt, and beg for her 
        forgiveness. Next time Miss V. visited her aunt, she ascertained that 
        Sarah Clarke <em>had</em> been housekeeper in the family thirty or forty 
        years before,--that some plate <em>had</em> mysteriously disappeared, 
        but that Sarah was much trusted, and was never suspected. The aunt declared 
        that if Sarah Clarke had taken it she freely forgave her. From that time 
        the haunted chamber was free from all disturbance. Mr. Owen comments on 
        this, as follows: &quot;Knowing the standing of the parties I am able to vouch 
        for the truth of this story. Let us consider what it discloses as to the 
        next world. There is repentance there as here. There is restless regret 
        and sorrow for grave sin committed while here. There is anxious desire 
        for pardon from those whom the spirit wronged during earth-life. In other 
        words, the natural effects of evil doing follow us to our next phase of 
        life; and, in that phase of life as in the present, we amend, and attain 
        to better things by virtue of repentance. . . . Another corollary is, 
        that when such spiritual phenomena present themselves, an endeavour to 
        establish communication with the manifesting spirit may result in benefit, 
        alike to a denizen of the other world and a disturbed inhabitant of this. 
        In this way Mrs. Propert (see p. 224), getting rid of the midnight foot-falls, 
        might have been in quiet possession of her villa at this day. I invite 
        attention also to the strong proof of identity furnished by Miss V.'s 
        story. The name of the housekeeper was unknown to both ladies when her 
        (alleged) spirit gave the message. There was nothing to suggest such a 
        name or such a confession as was made. Yet on enquiry both name and confession 
        were found to correspond with facts that had taken <font color="990000">[[p. 
        242]]</font> place thirty or forty years ago; to say nothing of a new 
        fact, tallying with all the rest--the cessation of the spiritual visits, 
        as soon as the visitor had no longer any motive to show herself.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How extraordinary,&quot; 
        many readers will exclaim, &quot;that a man of Mr. Owen's ability should waste 
        his time in discussing ghost stories!&quot; It is indeed extraordinary; for 
        do we not know all about possible and impossible spirits? Our men of science 
        and our philosophers are not quite sure that a spirit is possible; but 
        <em>if</em> possible, they are all quite clear that <em>spirits</em> would 
        never behave in the ridiculously human way in which reputed ghosts invariably 
        act. Let us, therefore, refuse to listen to these ghost stories told by 
        people we know nothing of, and hear what Mr. Owen has to tell us of the 
        wonders he has himself witnessed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent an immense 
        deal of time in trying to discover that gross imposture, the spirit rap, 
        but in vain! For this purpose he once lived for a week in a medium's house, 
        with full power to investigate. He walked all over the house with the 
        medium, but the raps came everywhere. They sounded on the floor, walls, 
        or ceiling of every room, on every article of furniture, on doors and 
        windows, on the marble mantel-piece, and the steel grate. With the same 
        medium they occurred on board a steamer, on the stool he sat on, on the 
        keel of a small boat in the water, on the ground out of doors, on trees, 
        and on rocks by the sea-shore. With every test that he could apply, he 
        could find no physical cause for these sounds. Sometimes they occurred 
        as delicate tickings, at others like blows of a sledge hammer--so tremendous 
        that it seemed impossible any article of furniture could resist them: 
        yet the table on which they resounded showed not a scratch! On almost 
        all these occasions the rooms were searched, the doors were locked, and 
        the mediums were held fast; yet Mr. Owen could never find out the trick! 
        How strange, when the thing is said to be so simple that our men of science 
        will not even take the trouble to refute it!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of 
        table-moving he had no more success. When Faraday exposed table-turning, 
        he remarked that experimenters who thought tables even rose in the air 
        should suspend them in a balance, and see if the weight was affected by 
        this supposed force. Mr. Owen, at the suggestion of the late Dr. Robert 
        Chambers, did this. Together, they suspended a table, weighing exactly 
        121 lbs., about 8 inches from the floor, by a powerful steelyard: two 
        mediums were present, whose feet and hands were attended to; yet, without 
        any contact whatever, the table, when requested, became lighter, coming 
        down to 60 lbs., having thus lost half its weight: when requested to be 
        made heavier it weighed 144 lbs. What are we to make of this? Two thoroughly 
        reliable witnesses and a balance tell us one thing; but men of science 
        say it can't be true: which are we to trust?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing his researches, 
        Mr. Owen had sittings alone with a medium. He examined the room, he locked 
        and <em>sealed</em> the <font color="990000">[[p. 243]]</font> doors, 
        and took with him privately marked slips of paper. He held the medium's 
        hands; yet writing was somehow effected on the paper placed under the 
        table, both in pencil and ink. Yet more; on one occasion he saw part of 
        the writing done, by a small luminous hand on the floor, holding the pencil. 
        On this experiment Mr. Owen remarks as follows: &quot;Were these spiritual 
        autographs? What else? Had I not <em>seen</em> one of them written? Had 
        I not seen one of these slips rise higher than the table, and sink back 
        again? Had I not felt Kate's two hands under mine at the very time when 
        that hand wrote and that paper rose and fell? Did Kate write eight or 
        ten lines with both her hands clasped? Did I write them with my left hand 
        without knowing it? Or had Kate brought the slips ready written? I picked 
        them up, and examined them critically, one by one. My private mark on 
        one corner of each--letters of the German alphabet, written in the German 
        character--still there! What way out? Are the senses of seeing, hearing, 
        and touch, in sane healthy persons, unworthy to be trusted? For me, common 
        sense bars that way out. I see nothing unlikely--not to say incredible--in 
        the theory that God may vouchsafe to man sensible proof of his immortality. 
        For others, to whom spiritual intercourse seems an absurdity,--for those 
        more especially to whom the hypothesis of another life wears the aspect 
        of a baseless dream,--let them select their own path out of the difficulty. 
        I think that, on any path they may take, they will have to accept theories 
        infinitely less tenable than those they decide to reject.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Owen also saw 
        much of Mr. Foster, the medium who has names written on his hands and 
        arms. On one occasion Mr. Foster extended his hand upon the table; it 
        was perfectly free from any mark whatever. Gradually a faint red mark 
        appeared on the wrist, which increased till it formed the letter F, remained 
        visible two or three minutes, and then faded away. This was the initial 
        letter of a name Mr. Owen had secretly written on a piece of paper, and 
        folded up tightly, and which was mixed with about twenty others on the 
        table. Dr. Carpenter tells us (in a letter published in &quot;The Spiritualist&quot; 
        of March 15, p. 21) that this is done by first tracing the writing on 
        the tense skin with a hard point, and then rubbing the place to bring 
        out the red blush. But unless we are to believe that Mr. Owen and the 
        late Dr. Robert Chambers, as well as many other careful observers who 
        have narrated their experiences with Mr. Foster, all make grossly false 
        or imperfect statements, this explanation by no means covers the facts; 
        as will be admitted by all who read Mr. Owen's narrative or the evidence 
        of Mr. E. L. Blanchard given at page 135 of the &quot;Report of the Committee 
        of the Dialectical Society.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen so many 
        inexplicable things himself, Mr. Owen is quite ready to believe others, 
        when they narrate their experiences; yet he often takes an immense deal 
        of trouble to test <font color="990000">[[p. 244]]</font> and confirm 
        them, as is well shown in the marvellous story of M. Bach and the old 
        Spinet. To be properly understood this must be read in the full detail 
        given by Mr. Owen: in outline it is as follows: Mons. Leon Bach purchased, 
        at an old curiosity shop in Paris, a very ancient but beautiful <em>spinet</em>, 
        as a present to his father, who is a great-grandson of <em>the</em> Bach, 
        and is a composer and musical amateur. The next night the elder Bach dreamt 
        that he saw a handsome young man, dressed in old court costume, and who 
        told him that the spinet had been given to him by his master King Henry. 
        He then said he would play on it an air, with words composed by the King, 
        in memory of a lady he had greatly loved: he did so, and M. Bach woke 
        in tears, touched by the pathos of the song. He went to sleep again; and 
        on waking in the morning was amazed to find on his bed a sheet of paper, 
        on which was written, in very old characters, both words and music of 
        the song he had heard in his dream. It was said to be by Henry III., and 
        the date inscribed on the spinet was a few years earlier. M. Bach, completely 
        puzzled, showed the music to his friends, and among them were some spiritualists, 
        from whom he heard, for the first time, their interpretation of the phenomena. 
        Now comes the most wonderful part of the history. M. Bach became himself 
        a writing medium; and through his hand was written, involuntarily, a statement 
        that inside the spinet, in a secret niche near the key-board, was a parchment, 
        nailed to the case, containing the lines written by King Henry when he 
        gave the instrument to his musician. The four-line stanza, which it was 
        said would be found on the parchment, was also given, and was followed 
        by the signature--Baldazzarini. Father and son then set to work to search 
        for this hidden scroll; and after two hours' close examination found, 
        in a narrow slit, a piece of old parchment about eleven inches by three, 
        containing, in very old writing, nearly the same words which M. Bach had 
        written, and signed--Henry. This parchment was taken to the Biblioth&egrave;que 
        Imp&eacute;riale, and submitted to experienced antiquarians, and was pronounced 
        to be an undoubtedly genuine autograph of Henry III.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the story; 
        but Mr. Owen is not content with ascertaining these facts at first hand, 
        and obtaining photographs of the spinet and the parchment, of both of 
        which he gives good representations. He also sets himself to hunt up historical 
        confirmation of the story, and after much research and many failures, 
        he finds that Baltasarini was an Italian musician, who came to France 
        in 1577, and was in great favour with Henry III.; that the King was passionately 
        attached to Marie de Cleves, who became wife of the Prince de Cond&eacute;; 
        and that several of the allusions to her in the verses corresponded to 
        what was known of her history. Other minute details were also found to 
        be historically accurate.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Owen then carefully 
        discusses the nature of the evidence, the character of the persons concerned, 
        and the possibility of <font color="990000">[[p. 245]]</font> deception. 
        M. Bach is an old man of high character; and to suppose that he, suddenly 
        and without conceivable motive, planned and carried out a most elaborate 
        and complicated imposture, is to suppose what is wholly incredible; but 
        Mr. Owen shows further, that the circumstances are such that M. Bach could 
        not have been an impostor, even had he been so inclined, and concludes 
        by remarking: &quot;I do not think dispassionate readers will accept such violent 
        improbabilities. But if not, what interesting suggestions touching spirit-intercourse 
        and spirit-identity connect themselves with this simple narrative of M. 
        Bach's spinet!&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recurring to Mr. 
        Owen's own experiences, perhaps the most astounding is his account of 
        the gradual formation of an apparition, distinctly visible to several 
        spectators. Every precaution was taken to render trick or imposture impossible; 
        yet if so, what marvel of modern science is equal to this? What natural 
        phenomenon so worthy of investigation! Our author's remarks on this case 
        will sufficiently indicate its nature. He says: &quot;My faith in the reality 
        of this appearance is not at all shaken by reflecting that a Signor Blitz, 
        or a Robert Houdin, having a theatre at command, arranged with ready entrances 
        and exits, with practical trap-doors, with dark lanterns in the wings, 
        with the means of producing dissolving views, could probably reproduce 
        all I witnessed. But here were a few ladies, in private life and in moderate 
        circumstances, quietly meeting in two apartments which were daily used 
        as school-rooms by one of their number, containing not even a recess where 
        a chair could be hidden away. They meet to satisfy a laudable curiosity, 
        admitting visitors now and then by courtesy only. No remuneration is demanded, 
        nor, very surely, would any have been accepted. They meet, on this occasion, 
        at my request, after having discontinued their researches for months, 
        vexed with unjust suspicions. They allow us to lock every exit, after 
        a close examination of the rooms. Here is neither motive nor opportunity--to 
        say nothing of qualification--for deception. The coin of the realm may 
        be counterfeited, but the coiners must have professional skill, an appropriate 
        location, and expensive machinery. Nor do counterfeiters ply their unholy 
        calling except with the prospect of large gains. Certain it is that I 
        beheld the gradual formation of the figure; that I witnessed its movements; 
        that I received from its hand an actual flower; that I saw the figure 
        disappear. Add to this, that the place of its disappearance was illuminated 
        by invisible agency, in answer to an unexpressed thought of mine.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may particularly 
        commend to the sceptical reader's attention the very full account of the 
        bell-ringings at Major Moor's, at Greenwich Hospital, and other places, 
        continuing for months, and baffling all attempts to find a cause for them; 
        to the disturbances at Lydersterne Parsonage, continued for sixty years; 
        and to many others, none of which have ever been explained. <font color="990000">[[p. 
        246]]</font> Mr. Owen is not content to let these matters rest (with the 
        sceptical), or contemptuously to ignore them (with the scientific); but 
        actually imputes them to spirits, whose agency he believes is proved by 
        other evidence, of the nature of which we have already given some examples. 
        This evidence, taken as a whole, proves, he thinks, that there is not 
        habitual intercourse between the two worlds; that we seem, probably, something 
        like apparitions to those spirits who visit us; that they often seek communion, 
        from affection or from other motives; that they have difficulties in reaching 
        us,--difficulties wisely interposed, because, if spiritual intercourse 
        were as common as earthly communion, we should many of us be dissatisfied 
        with our lot, and neglect our earthly duties. &quot;They seek from time to 
        time to visit us. But coming from their world of spirits, invisible to 
        ordinary sight, inaudible by ordinary speech, how are they to make their 
        presence known? How are they to attract our attention? In what manner 
        does a traveller, arriving under cloud of night before a fast-closed mansion, 
        seek to reach the in-dwellers--seek to announce his presence? Is it not 
        by KNOCKING or RINGING?&quot; This is our author's reply to sneers at &quot;rapping&quot; 
        and &quot;bell-ringing&quot; phenomena.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have devoted 
        so much space to a sketch of Mr. Owen's book, because, in the first place, 
        it merits notice as a literary work of a high class; and in the second, 
        it brings prominently before us what is either the most gigantic and mysterious 
        of delusions or the most important of truths. In either case it deserves 
        a full and fair discussion. Neither is such a subject out of place in 
        a scientific journal, for, in whatever light we view it, it is really 
        a scientific question. If a fallacy or a delusion, it is of so wide-spread 
        a nature, and influences such numbers of well-educated and even scientific 
        men, that we have a right to demand of science a full and satisfactory 
        exposure of it. If a truth, then it is certainly, as Mr. Owen maintains, 
        a science of itself; a new science, and one of the most overwhelming importance 
        in its bearings upon philosophy, history, and religion. It is now becoming 
        almost a common thing to acknowledge that there is a certain amount of 
        truth in the facts; with a proviso, always, of the writer's repudiation 
        of the spiritual theory. For my own part, the only thing that makes the 
        facts credible on evidence <em>is</em> the spiritual theory. Mr. A., or 
        Prof. B., or Dr. C., may state that <em>they know</em> certain of the 
        facts are true, but that all these facts can be explained without calling 
        in the aid of spirits. Perhaps they can. But why should I, or any other 
        reader, accept A., B., or C.'s facts, and reject Mr. Owen's, when the 
        former are not one whit more intrinsically probable, or supported by one 
        iota better testimony, than the latter? Yet these latter actually <em>force</em> 
        upon us the spiritual theory, just as the facts of Geology <em>force</em> 
        upon us the belief in long series of ancient living forms, different from 
        those now upon the earth. I must accept all the equally <font color="990000">[[p. 
        247]]</font> well-attested facts, of equal intrinsic probability, or reject 
        all. I cannot believe in Cretaceous fossils as realities, and reject Silurian 
        as freaks of nature; neither can I accept the facts B. may have witnessed, 
        and reject those of the rest of the alphabet. Yet if all the main classes 
        of facts are admitted, the spiritual theory appears as clearly from them 
        as the theory of extinct animals follows from the facts presented by their 
        fossil remains. The position of the Quarterly Reviewer is, that there 
        are no facts worth speaking of, and, therefore, no true spiritual theory 
        can be founded on them. This is safe ground, as long as all the evidence 
        for the facts is carefully denied, misrepresented, or ignored. But when 
        there are ten thousand witnesses to these facts, of whom say nine thousand 
        are as good and competent as A. or B., it is not safe ground for A. or 
        B. to admit just so much of the facts as they have witnessed themselves, 
        and reject the rest. The problem we have now to solve is--how much of 
        the facts are true. Till this is done by some better test than individual 
        experience, it is premature to discuss what theories may or may not explain 
        them. In the meantime, let no one prejudge the question till they have 
        studied Mr. Owen's facts and carefully weighed his arguments.</p>

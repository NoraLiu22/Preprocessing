      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Myths abound when it 
        comes to the nature, care and keeping of reptiles and amphibians. One 
        of the most common is related to the feeding of live prey. Many people, 
        including experienced herpetologists, herpetoculturists, pet store owners, 
        store employees, and authors of reptile books say that reptiles and amphibians 
        (collectively known as herps) will only eat live prey.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">On the contrary. Most 
        herps found in the pet trade can easily be converted over to feeding on 
        killed prey, especially those herps who are already feeding on live rodents 
        and rabbits. Reptiles and amphibians who normally feed on a variety of 
        prey in the wild such as invertebrates, small mammals, amphibians and 
        birds will take killed prey in captivity if offered properly. Herps whose 
        main dietary staples include birds, fish and swimming amphibians and insects 
        are more difficult to convert to feeding on killed and some may never 
        do so.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The types of herps 
        who can be easily converted to killed prey include snakes such as king, 
        milk, gopher, pine, bull, boas, pythons (except the more difficult green 
        tree pythons and emerald boas), corn and rat snakes. Lizards who will 
        eat killed prey include blue-tongue and other omnivorous skinks, many 
        of the geckos, bearded dragons, water dragons, sailfin lizards, basilisks, 
        monitors of all types, and teiids (tegus, agamas). Large rodent-eating 
        amphibians such as bullfrogs and ornate horned frogs will also take prekilled 
        prey.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2" ><b>Why Feed Killed?<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The most common 
        arguments presented for feeding live prey are that &quot;feeding live 
        is more natural for the animal - after all, no one kills their food in 
        the wild&quot; and &quot;I like to give my animal a chance to hunt and 
        kill because it really likes it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The fact, however, 
        is that captivity is not a natural state. Our reptiles and amphibians 
        are not spending their days searching for food, hiding from predators, 
        searching out favored microhabitats while avoiding aggressive members 
        of their own species, hiding, vulnerable to predation and attack, during 
        their shed periods. Instead they are housed (or should be!) in a comfy 
        enclosure with all of their habitat needs met. If we wanted our animals 
        to enjoy a natural state, we would never have acquired them.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">As for needing the 
        &quot;thrill of the kill,&quot; that is anthropomorphism at its worst. 
        What our reptiles and amphibians need is a large enough environment outfitted 
        properly to give it enough mental and physical stimulation. For reptiles 
        who are handleable, handling and that opportunity to be out of their enclosure 
        provides the exercise and stimulation that they need, not chasing a rat 
        or mouse around a small rectangular box.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Feeding killed is also 
        safer for the reptile or amphibian. An animal who is not hungry will not 
        eat. It will ignore whatever is going on around it. A prey animal left 
        alone in a tank with a predator, however, is not so relaxed about the 
        whole thing. Mice and chicks are usually terrified, spending their time 
        cowering in a corner or trying to find a place to hide. Rats, however, 
        come from bolder, and hungrier, stock. If left alone long enough with 
        a disinterested predator, they will begin to eat whatever is around: your 
        snake or lizard. Crickets and mealworms are similarly fearless and hungry. 
        Rats have eaten their way into snakes, devouring the skin and flesh off 
        their backs, exposing long stretches of backbone, even quite literally 
        eviscerating them. Even crickets and mealworms will gnaw away at the skin 
        and seek moisture from the eyes of healthy herps when left unattended 
        in an enclosure without proper food and moisture for them. One of the 
        most tragic things a vet or experienced herper sees is an otherwise healthy 
        reptile or amphibian that has to be put down or is already dead from such 
        prey feeding practices.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Live prey may also 
        fight back during a feeding session causing severe injuries. Claws and 
        teeth can bite through the mouth area, puncture eyes, cut through tongue 
        sheaths, and puncture or slice through a coil of the predator's body.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">There are those who 
        will argue that it does not happen in the wild. There are also those who 
        will argue that it does happen in the wild and that, being a natural occurrence, 
        should not be avoided in captivity. It does happen in the wild. We don't 
        see much evidence of it as the injured or crippled predator manages to 
        hide away before dying or is itself preyed upon by another predator before 
        dying or is scavenged after dying. I responded to a call where I found 
        a wild gopher snake whose jaw had been fractured and half its tongue bitten 
        off by prey who had successfully fought off a feeding attempt, its grossly 
        swollen and bloodied tongue sheath dangling from the broken, crooked jaw.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Whether it happens 
        or not, however, is immaterial. We are responsible for the health and 
        well-being of our animals in captivity. That means keeping them properly 
        housed, heated, humidified and fed. And that means keeping them safe from 
        avoidable harm.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2" ><b>Humanely Killing 
        Prey<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">There are 
        a number of ways of killing prey most of which involve the rapid separation 
        of the vertebrae at the neck just below the base of the skull. Some people 
        can do this quickly by hand; others recommend the use of a spoon. Still 
        others recommend blunt trauma to effect immediate unconsciousness and 
        death.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">There is, however, 
        an easier way that is less traumatic to the mammalian prey animal, ensures 
        immediate unconsciousness followed almost instantaneously by death. This 
        is done by setting up a tank, be it a deep aquarium, bucket or rubber 
        or plastic wastebasket set aside for this use, and filling it half full 
        of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. Once the tank is thus 'charged,' the prey 
        animal is placed inside (be careful to not get your head too close to 
        the tank as the gas is quite capable of knocking you unconscious, too). 
        It is immediately rendered unconscious and is killed within a few minutes. 
        The killed prey can then be removed (it is recommended that you use long 
        kitchen or barbecue tongs), and set aside to be fed out or frozen for 
        later use. Let the gas dissipate outside by setting the tank outside for 
        a couple of hours.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">You can get CO2 relatively 
        inexpensively in a gaseous form in tanks from welder's supply shops, and 
        in solid form (as dry ice) from ice houses; these suppliers may be found 
        in the telephone yellow pages.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2" ><b>Sources of Killed 
        Prey<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Live prey 
        may be purchased as usual, killed humanely, and then fed out. Have an 
        experienced herper show you how to quickly kill prey by breaking the neck. 
        If you are unsure how to do it, you may cause injury and pain rather than 
        death, so please do not experiment.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">While some people have 
        no problem with the feeding of prey and are interested in feeding killed 
        prey, they may not be able to do it themselves. An increasing number of 
        pet stores are selling prekilled prey or may kill upon request. If you 
        have a large number of reptiles or just a few big eaters, there are many 
        <a href="resources/preysources.html">mail order prey suppliers</a> who 
        ship out bulk orders of frozen prey. Their prices are less expensive than 
        pet store prices, even when adding in the cost of shipping. It takes much 
        less room to store 100 frozen adult mice in your freezer than it does 
        to house, feed and care for properly the same number of live mice. Buying 
        frozen can save you enough money to enable you to provide better care 
        and housing for your herp, or even to acquire another one.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If you breed your own 
        or acquire large quantities of live mice, rats or rabbits, you can set 
        up a mini-gas chamber to quickly euthanize the prey. By 'charging' a deep 
        enclosure, such as a tall aquarium or a clean garbage can, with carbon 
        dioxide (CO2), and then placing the prey inside, they are killed almost 
        instantaneously, being rendered unconscious when they hit the gas. (Note: 
        you cannot euthanize reptiles or amphibians this way as their oxygen metabolism 
        is very different and they can live surprising long periods of time in 
        an oxygen deficient atmosphere.) Gassed prey should be frozen for several 
        weeks before feeding out. This will dissipate any gas in the tissues (which 
        some people feel may be harmful based on experience with birds of prey 
        freshly gassed rodents) and will kill any parasites in the rodents.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font >Defrosting 
        Frozen Prey<br>
        </font> </b>First off, you don't feed out the prey while it is frozen! 
        You do need to thaw it thoroughly and warm it slightly before feeding 
        it out.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Freezing for 30 days 
        kills off most parasites and other organisms that may be harmful to your 
        herp. Prey may be kept safely frozen and fed out for up to six months 
        after the date it was first frozen.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Remove the number of 
        prey items you need from the bag of prey. You can place them in a clean 
        plastic bag and soak in warm water, or leave in the refrigerator overnight 
        to defrost, warming up in warm water. If you are skilled with your microwave, 
        larger prey may be defrosted and gently heated using the defrost setting 
        or lower power settings. Small pinkies can be quickly defrosted and warmed 
        by holding under warm running water, or in a bag on top of a warm surface, 
        such as the stove-top over the pilot light.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Always make sure that 
        not only is the frozen prey thoroughly defrosted but that it is warmed 
        up to a temperature above room temperature. You do not want your warm 
        reptile eating cold prey, and warming the prey also makes it smell more 
        strongly, and thus more attractive, to your reptile, and may be especially 
        important when feeding reluctant feeders and when in the process of converting 
        live feeders to killed.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2" ><b>Feeding Killed 
        Prey<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">When first 
        converting your herp from live to killed, try first offering a killed 
        prey by dangling it from hemostats or kitchen tongs -- never hold the 
        prey in your fingers! You may need to move it back and forth a bit to 
        catch the herp's attention. Be prepared for the strike and quickly release 
        the prey.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2" ><b>Converting Live 
        Feeders to Eating Killed<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">If the herp 
        is not interested, you might need to first feed a small stunned live prey, 
        followed immediately by a freshly killed prey, then a prekilled prey. 
        At the next feeding, start off with a freshly killed prey, followed immediately 
        by a prekilled prey. When these are easily taken, go to offering the prekilled 
        prey.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2" ><b>Converting Non-Rodent 
        Eaters to Rodent Prey<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Some snakes 
        available in the pet trade are amphibian and lizard eaters. This makes 
        it not only difficult to obtain prey for them, but makes it rather difficult 
        to convert them to eating rodent prey.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">A suitable food such 
        as a frog or lizard should be obtained and humanely euthanized for feeding. 
        Instead of feeding it out, however, the lizard or frog should be rubbed 
        all over a suitably sized prekilled mouse or rat to scent it. The scented 
        rodent is then offered for feeding.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Another method is to 
        pith (stick a pin or small nail) into the brain case of a killed rodent; 
        this intensifies the scent and may attract a reluctant feeder into feeding.</font></p>

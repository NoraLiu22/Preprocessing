<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><B><I>Is the name of the tribe "Blackfoot" or "Blackfeet"? Where did this name come from?</I></b><BR></font> 
"Blackfoot" is the English translation of the word <I>siksika</I>, which means "black foot." It refers to the dark colored moccasins the
people wear. Some Blackfoot people are annoyed by the plural "Blackfeet," which is obviously an anglicization.
But most Blackfoot people accept both terms. "Blackfoot" is more commonly used in Canada, and "Blackfeet" is more 
commonly used in the United States.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><B><I>Where do the Blackfeet Indians live?</I></b><BR></font> 
The Blackfeet Indians are original residents of the northern Plains, particularly 
<A href="http://www.native-languages.org/montana.htm">Montana</a>,
<A href="http://www.native-languages.org/idaho.htm">Idaho</a>, and 
<A href="http://www.native-languages.org/alberta.htm">Alberta, Canada</a>. Most Blackfoot people still live in this region today.
Here is a <A href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_LbIlP2wfBuY/SpG6tFtItUI/AAAAAAAAAyY/fmZIhdKfOVo/s1600-h/BlackfootRegionalMap.jpg">map</a>
showing traditional Blackfoot lands and the location of their reservations today.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><B><I>How is the Blackfeet Indian nation organized?</I></b><BR></font>
There are three Blackfoot bands in Canada and one in the United States. 
The Canadian bands are called the <I>Piikani</I> (or Peigan) First Nation, the <I>Kainai</I> (or Blood) First Nation,
and the <I>Siksika</I> (or Blackfoot) First Nation. The American band is called the <I>Blackfeet Tribe</I>.
These four Blackfoot bands share a common language and culture, but they are politically independent. 
Each of them has its own government, laws, police, and services, just like a small country. 
Each Blackfoot community lives on its own <I><b>reservation</b></I> or <I><b>reserve</b></I>,
which means land that belongs to the tribe and is legally under their control. 
<BR><BR>
In the past, the Piikani, Kainai, and Siksika Nations were each led by a council of chiefs, one from each clan.
The Blackfeet people really valued harmony, so
every chief had to agree on a decision before action could be taken (this is called <I><b>consensus</b></I>). 
The Piikani, Kainai, and Siksika were frequent allies and were sometimes known as the <I>Blackfoot Confederacy</I>, 
but each group always had its own leadership and made its own decisions, and sometimes they were even at war with
each other. Today, Blackfeet council members are elected like governors or mayors are... but their government still works by consensus.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><I><B>What is the population of the Blackfoot nation?</I></b><BR></font> 
Today there are about 25,000 citizens of the four Blackfoot Indian bands. About 10,000 of them live in the United States, and the
rest live in Canada. There are also many other people who are Blackfoot descendants but are not tribal members.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><B><I>What language do the Blackfeet speak?</I></b><BR></font> 
Most Blackfoot Indians speak English today, but about half of them also speak their native 
<B><I>Blackfoot language</b></I>. 
Blackfoot is a musical language that has complicated verbs with many parts. 
Most Blackfoot words are very long and difficult for English speakers to pronounce, but one
easy word that you might like to learn is "Oki" (pronounced "oh-kee,") meaning "Hello!"
You can listen to a Blackfoot woman talk in her language

Blackfoot children do the same things all children do--play with each other, go to school and help around the house. 
Many Blackfoot children like to go hunting and fishing with their fathers. In the past, Indian kids had more 
chores and less time to play, just like colonial children. But they d<img src="singledot.png">id 
have <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/dolls.htm">dolls</a>, toys, and special games.
Here is a picture of one type of <a href="http://www.nativetech.org/games/hoop&pole.html">hoop game</a> 
popular among Blackfoot boys and girls. Like many Native Americans, Blackfoot mothers carried their babies in

Blackfoot women were in charge of the home. Besides cooking and cleaning, a Blackfoot woman built her family's house and dragged the heavy posts with her
whenever the tribe moved. Houses belonged to the women in the Blackfoot tribe. Blackfoot men were big game hunters and sometimes went to war to defend their
families. Most Blackfoot chiefs and warriors were men. Both genders took part in storytelling, artwork and music, and traditional medicine.

<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><B><I>What were Blackfoot homes like in the past?</I></b><BR></font>

 The Blackfoot lived in buffalo-hide houses called <B><I>tipis</b></I> (or <b><I>teepees</b></I>). 
Here are more <a href="http://www.native-languages.org/houses.htm#tipi">teepee</a> pictures for you to look at.
Since the Blackfeet moved frequently to follow the buffalo
herds, a tipi was carefully designed to set up and break down quickly, like a modern tent. An entire Blackfoot village could be packed up and ready to
move within an hour. Today, Native Americans only put up a tepee for fun or to connect with their heritage, not as shelter. 
Most Blackfoot people live in modern houses and apartment buildings, just like you.

<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><B><I>What was Blackfoot clothing like? Did they wear a feather headdress and face paint?</I></b><BR></font>

Blackfoot women wore long deerskin dresses. Men wore buckskin tunics and 
<a href="http://www.native-languages.org/breechcloth.htm">breechcloths with leggings</a>. 
Blackfoot dresses and war shirts were fringed and often
decorated with porcupine quills, beads, and elk teeth. Both Blackfeet women and men wore 
<B>moccasins</B> on their feet, which they often adorned with beadwork designs.
Here are some pictures of <a href="http://www.native-languages.org/moccasins.htm">Native American beaded moccasins</a>.
In cold weather, they wore buffalo-hide robes. Later, Blackfoot people adopted some characteristics of
European costume such as calico dresses and felt hats. Here are more 
<A HREF="http://www.nativetech.org/clothing/regions/regn10.html">images of Blackfoot clothing</a>, 
and some photos and links ab<img src="singledot.png">out 
<a href="http://www.native-languages.org/clothing.htm">traditional Indian clothing</a> in general.
<BR><BR>
Blackfeet chiefs wore tall feather headdresses, different from the long warbonnets of the 
<A href="http://www.bigorrin.org/sioux_kids.htm">Sioux</a>. Here are some pictures of these different styles of
<A href="http://www.native-languages.org/headdresses.htm#warbonnets">Native American headdresses</a>.
Men wore their hair in three braids with a topknot or high pompadour,
and women wore their hair loose or in two thicker braids. Blackfeet people painted their faces for special occasions. 
They used different patterns for war paint, religious ceremonies, and festive decoration. 
Sometimes men would tattoo their arms with geometric designs. Both men and women pierced their ears and wore shell jewelry.
<BR><BR>
Today, some Blackfoot people 
still wear moccasins or a buckskin shirt, but they wear modern clothes like jeans instead of breechcloths... 
and they only wear feathers in their hair on special occasions like a powwow.

No--the Blackfoot Indians weren't coastal people, and when they traveled by river, they usually built <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/boats.htm#rafts">rafts</a></I></B>.
There were no horses in North America until colonists brought them over from Europe, so the Blackfeet used to use dogs 
pulling <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/travois.htm">travois</a></I></B> (a kind of drag sled) to help them carry their belongings over land. Once horses were introduced the Blackfoot
culture quickly adopted to them and the people became much more migratory.

The Blackfoot staple food was buffalo. Blackfoot men usually hunted the buffalo by driving them off cliffs or stalking them with
bow and arrow. As they acquired horses, the Blackfoot tribe began to pursue the buffalo herds for 
communal hunts, moving their villages often as the buffalo migrated. In addition to buffalo meat, the Blackfoot Indians also ate small game like 
ground squirrels, nuts and berries, and steamed camas roots, and they often traded with neighboring agricultural tribes to get corn and beans.

Traditionally most warriors were men, but some Plains Indian women,
especially widows, would ride to war with the men. The Blackfoot woman demonstrating a war bow in this picture is a World War II veteran.

<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><I><B>What is Blackfoot music like?</I></b><BR></font> 
The two most important types of Blackfoot <a name="music">instruments</a> are the <a href="http://www.native-languages.org/drums.htm">drum</a>
and the <a href="http://www.native-languages.org/flutes.htm">flute</a>. Blackfoot drums are usually large and several men play them together
at festivals while the rest of the tribe sings and dances. Flutes were made of carved wood and were used to play soft melodies, especially
love songs. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeYYCpWfUQQ">video</a> of Blackfoot musicians drumming and
singing at the Siksika Pow Wow.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><I><B><font color=brown>What other Native Americans did the Blackfeet tribe interact with?</I></b><BR></font> 
The Blackfeet were far-ranging people, especially once they acquired horses, and so they interacted frequently with all the other tribes
of Montana and the Northern Plains, particularly the <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/gros.htm">Gros Ventre</A>,
<A href="http://www.native-languages.org/shoshone.htm">Shoshone</A>, <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/crow.htm">Crow</A>,
and <a href="http://www.bigorrin.org/cree_kids.htm">Cree</A>. The Blackfeet usually communicated with these tribes using the
<A href="http://www.native-languages.org/sign.htm">Plains Indian Sign Language</A>. Sometimes the Blackfeet tribe was friendly with these 
other tribes, trading goods and intermarrying. Other times they fought wars against each other. 
<BR><BR>
Plains Indian customs regarding war were different than European ones. 
Plains Indian tribes didn't usually fight over territory but instead to prove their courage, and so Blackfoot war parties 
rarely fought to the death and almost never destroyed other villages. Instead, they preferred to 
<I><B>count coup</B></I> (touch an opponent in battle without harming him),
steal an enemy's weapon or horse, or force the other tribe's warriors to retreat. 
The Europeans who first met them were surprised by how often the Blackfoot tribe fought with their neighbors--even the 
different Blackfoot bands often fought one another--yet how easily they made peace with each other when they were done fighting.

One famous Blackfoot Indian chief was <I><B><a href="http://www.native-languages.org/definitions/crowfoot.htm">Crowfoot</a></B></I>, who led the Blackfoot people in Canada during the second half of the 19th century.
Crowfoot was an accomplished warrior and a gifted diplomat. He was most famous for negotiating peace between the Blackfoot Nation and the Canadian
government, and for fighting alcoholism among the Blackfoot people. Crowfoot was also the adopted father of the Cree chief Poundmaker, 
and became close friends with the Sioux leader Sitting Bull. You can read an online biography of Crowfoot

<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><B><I>What kinds of stories do the Blackfeet tell?</I></b><BR></font> 
There are lots of traditional Blackfoot legends and fairy tales. Storytelling is very important to the 
Blackfoot Indian culture. Here is a Pikuni Blackfoot 
story about <a href="http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/TheTheftfromtheSun-Blackfoot.html">a man who tried to steal the Sun's pants</a>.

<IMG SRC="woodbead.gif"><font color=brown><I><B>What about Blackfoot religion?</I></b><BR></font> 
Spirituality and religion were important parts of Blackfoot life, and some people continue to practice traditional beliefs today.
It is respectful to avoid imitating religious rituals for school projects since some Blackfoot people care about them deeply.

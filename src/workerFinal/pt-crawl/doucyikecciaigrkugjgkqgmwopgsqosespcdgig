                Robert Darwin (12 February 1809 to 19 April 1882) was a British 
                naturalist who ranks among the most famous (and to some infamous) 
                scientists in history. Remarkably, long before genetics and the 
                <a href="../Biology/WatsonCrickNature.htm">copying mechanism of 
                genetic material</a> through DNA were understood, Charles Darwin&#8217;s 
                concept of natural and sexual selection (or evolution) was mostly 
                correct. Evolution endures as the organizing principle of all 
                biological science.</font></p>

                interest in natural history arose as he studied medicine and theology 
                at university. Darwin's five-year voyage on the Beagle and provided 
                the empirical evidence for developing his theory of natural selection 
                by 1838. Knowing that others had been severely punished for such 
                &quot;heretical&quot; ideas, he only confided in his closest friends 
                and continued his research. By 1858, however, knowing that Alfred 
                Russel Wallace had developed a similar theory, he was finally 
                forced to publish his controversial theory.</font></p>

                &quot;The affinities of all the beings of the same class have 
                sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile 
                largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent 
                existing species; and those produced during each former year may 
                represent the long succession of extinct species . . . The limbs 
                divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser 
                branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding 
                twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying 
                branches may well represent the classification of all extinct 
                and living species in groups subordinate to groups . . . From 
                the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed 
                and dropped off, and these lost branches of various sizes may 
                represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have 
                now no living representatives, and which are known to us only 
                from having been found in a fossil state . . . As buds give rise 
                by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and 
                overtop on all a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it 
                has been with the Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and 
                broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface 
                with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications&quot; (Charles

                the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different 
                periods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably 
                come into play; some one check or some few being generally the 
                most potent, but all concur in determining the average number 
                or even the existence of the species. In some cases it can be 
                shown that <strong>widely-different checks act on the same species 
                in different districts</strong>. When we look at the plants and 
                bushes clothing an en<strong>tangled bank</strong>, we are tempted 
                to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call 
                chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that 
                when an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation 
                springs up; but it has been observed that ancient Indian ruins 
                in the Southern United States, which must formerly have been cleared 
                of trees, now display the same beautiful diversity and proportion 
                of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forest. What a struggle 
                must have gone on during long centuries between the several kinds 
                of trees, each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand; 
                what war between insect and insect - between insects, snails, 
                and other animals with birds and beasts of prey - all striving 
                to increase, all feeding on each other, or on the trees, their 
                seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first clothed 
                the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees! Throw up 
                a handful of feathers, and all must fall to the ground according 
                to definite laws; but how simple is the problem where each shall 
                fall compared to that of the action and reaction of the innumerable 
                plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, 
                the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the 
                old Indian ruins!&quot;</font></div>

                to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does 
                vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which 
                is certainly the case; and if variation or modification in the 
                organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of 
                life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex 
                eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by 
                our imagination, can hardly be considered real&quot;</font></p>

                with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the

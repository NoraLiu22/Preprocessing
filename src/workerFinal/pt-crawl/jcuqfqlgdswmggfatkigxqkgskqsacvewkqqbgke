/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        55]]</font> A very interesting &quot;special report&quot; has just been issued by 
        the Department of Mines of Victoria, giving an account of the remarkable 
        evidences of glaciation observed at a locality about twenty miles south-east 
        of Sandhurst, and about the same distance north of the great Dividing 
        Range.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> The report is illustrated by a map and sections on 
        a large scale, and by eight excellent photographic prints, showing the 
        character of the deposit on the surface and in railway cuttings, the striated 
        bed rock, and the striated and grooved blocks and boulders, so that full 
        materials are given for the conclusion that we have here an undoubted 
        glacial deposit. A brief summary of this report will therefore be interesting 
        to all students of the phenomena and problems of terrestrial glaciation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district now 
        specially described is about fifteen miles in one direction by five in 
        another, and over this area of about thirty-six square miles the conglomerate 
        is continuous, overlying the Silurian rocks of the district. It has generally 
        a rounded or undulating surface, but shows cliffs about 100 feet high 
        in some of the gullies, and its maximum thickness is estimated at 300 
        or 400 feet, while its highest point is about 700 feet above sea-level. 
        As well seen in the cliffs and several railway cuttings, the conglomerate 
        consists of a matrix of sand and clayey matter containing huge boulders, 
        great angular and sub-angular masses of rock, pebbles, and rock-fragments 
        of endless variety of size, form, and material. Many of these masses are 
        planed, scored, striated, or polished. <font color="990000">[[p. 56]]</font> 
        Planing is very common, and is either flat or with a hollow or a convex 
        surface. Some of the intensely hard hornfels blocks have been ground on 
        one or more sides, several planes being sometimes ground on the same stone, 
        while some very hard rocks are deeply grooved. In other cases the striations 
        and scratches are so fine as only to be seen with a lens; while one surface 
        block of very hard material has been ground down and polished, so that 
        it glitters in the sun. In fact, every form of surface-grinding produced 
        by recent glaciation appears to be here present.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the 
        ground is everywhere strewn with pebbles and boulders, the result of the 
        washing away of the finer materials of the conglomerate; but, besides 
        these, there is a tract of about two and a half miles by one mile near 
        the centre of the conglomerate-area, on the north side of Mount Ida Creek, 
        which is rather thickly strewn with large blocks, termed by the writer 
        &quot;erratics,&quot; though they can hardly be erratics in the sense of having 
        been deposited on the present surface by ice. There are forty-five of 
        these blocks, which are either of granite, sandstone, or quartz, and vary 
        in size from 6 feet by 4 feet, to 20 by 12 feet. One of the finest, termed 
        &quot;The Stranger,&quot; of coarse-grained granite, is 16 1/2 feet by 10 1/2 feet, 
        and 5 feet thick, the estimated weight being 30 tons. It is planed and 
        scored in a remarkable manner, as are most of the other blocks. It is 
        curious that beyond this limited area only three or four large blocks 
        are found on the surface, while no pebbles or boulders derived from the 
        conglomerate are found more than a hundred yards beyond the present limits 
        of that formation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A striking feature 
        of the conglomerate is the great variety of rocks present in it, seeming 
        as if &quot;the d&eacute;bris of a continent&quot; had been here gathered together. 
        There are an almost infinite variety of granites, syenites, gneisses, 
        schists, quartzites, sandstones (hard and soft, coarse and fine), slates, 
        shales, conglomerates, amygdaloids, porphyries, vein quartz, red, yellow, 
        and grey jaspers, and many others. Some of these can be identified with 
        existing rocks, but others are not known in Victoria. In some cases there 
        is what appears to be river shingle, in others the delicate scratches 
        preserved even on soft shale show that the material has not been exposed 
        to any denuding action. There are also sandstone beds of considerable 
        extent and thickness intercalated with the conglomerate, indicating that 
        there were alternating periods of river or current action while the conglomerate 
        was being formed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole of the 
        phenomena here briefly sketched point unmistakably to glacial action; 
        in fact, there seems to be hardly any part of Wales or Scotland where 
        such action is more clearly indicated. There are, it is true, no moraines, 
        because the period when the conglomerate was laid down is too remote, 
        both newer and older pliocene rocks overlying it in some places. Indeed, 
        from fossils found in shales overlying what appears to be a similar conglomerate 
        at Bacchus Marsh, south of the Dividing Range, the writer of the report 
        is inclined to consider the whole formation to be of Pal&aelig;ozoic age. 
        In one part of the area the bed rock is exposed, and this is covered with 
        abundant striations crossing the stratification lines, indicating either 
        powerful glacier or iceberg action.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of localities 
        where similar conglomerates have been found is given, showing that they 
        occur to the northward for about 250 miles along the foot of the hills 
        bordering the Murray valley, disappearing under the Tertiary deposits 
        of the lowlands; they have also been met with forming the floor of the 
        auriferous deposits in mines at Creswick and Carisbrook, on the northern 
        slopes of the Dividing Range; and also, as already stated, at Bacchus 
        Marsh, and a few other localities on the south side of the range. We are 
        not told, however, whether similar indications of glacial action occur 
        in these localities. If these deposits are really all glacial and contemporaneous, 
        they indicate an extent of glaciated country that would imply either a 
        very lofty mountain range or the occurrence of a real glacial epoch in 
        the southern hemisphere.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct evidence 
        of the superposition of Tertiary rocks of Pliocene age shows that the 
        glacial conglomerate itself is of great antiquity, but no special attention 
        appears to have been given to the question of the age of the so-called 
        &quot;erratics.&quot; The fact that they are found in so limited an area seems to 
        show that they are not derived from the conglomerate itself by the process 
        of sub-aerial denudation, and the same thing is indicated by the apparent 
        fact that they all rest upon the present land surface. The photographs 
        seem to indicate this, and nothing is said about their relations to the 
        subjacent conglomerate, or whether any considerable proportion of them 
        still form part of it, merely protruding above the surface, as would certainly 
        be the case if they owe their present position to the mere washing away 
        of the finer parts of the deposit. But, if so, why should they be called 
        &quot;erratics,&quot; as distinguished from the blocks and boulders which are still 
        embedded in the formation? If, on the other hand, they are supposed to 
        be true erratics--that is, to have been deposited on the present land-surface 
        by ice agency--they must clearly be much less ancient than the conglomerate 
        itself, or they would hardly retain such fresh-looking striations, grooving, 
        and polishing as some of them exhibit. It is to be hoped that these most 
        interesting deposits will be the subject of very careful study by Australian 
        geologists, since they seem calculated to throw much light on the geological 
        history of the old Australian continent.</p>

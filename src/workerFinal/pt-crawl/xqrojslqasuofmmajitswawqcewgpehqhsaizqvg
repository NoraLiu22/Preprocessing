<div id="mn"> <h2>Visual Illusions:  Explained?</h2>

<p>

Is seeing really believing? What happens when what we see doesn't 
necessarily reflect reality? </p>

<p>Visual illusions have been around far longer than the science that 
has existed to explain them. One of the first examples of visual 
illusions in architecture came from the roofs of Greek temples which 
appeared curved though they were in fact linear structures. The 
Airavatesvara Temple in India holds one of the most famous and oldest 
examples: a sculpture appearing to be both a bull and elephant, 
depending on the observer.  </p>

<p>Illusions result from a mismatch between reality and our subjective 
perception of our surroundings, events, or an object. We can organize 
visual illusions into several categories: literal, physiological, and 
cognitive. </p>

<h3>Literal Illusions</h3>
<img src="gif/vi1n.jpg" width="114" height="103" alt="vase or face" class="flr" /> 

<p> Look at this drawing on the right.  What do you see? Do you see a vase? Or two 
faces? Or both? If you can discern both images but not simultaneously, 
you are likely witnessing a literal illusion. A literal illusion occurs 
because our brains do not perceive information in individual chunks; 
this is also known as Gestalt psychology. There are many principles of 
Gestalt psychology including the principle of similarity, proximity, 
depth, and figure-ground. We can apply the specific Gestalt principle of 
"figure-ground" here to analyze what's going on. The principle states 
that our brains focus on a main object (the figure) and will tune out 
the surroundings (the ground) in order to avoid sensory overload and to 
direct our attention to only what's necessary. In this image, there are 
two main objects (the vase and the faces) and when we focus on one it is 
the figure, and the other naturally becomes the ground. </p>
<img src="gif/vi2n.jpg" class="fl" width="241" height="300" alt="Arcimboldo painting">

<p>The Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo was famously known for 
blending illusions with his art. Have a look at this painting on the left and see if you can explain to yourself 
what's going on in your brain!</p
</p>

<h3>Physiological Illusions</h3> 
<p>

<img src="spots.gif" class="flr" width="228" height="222" alt="Hermann Grid">
What do you see in this image on the right? It appears to be a simple pattern with 
black squares and intersecting white lines. How many grey dots can you 
count at each intersection? If you find that there are many grey dots 
that all seem to disappear when you try to focus on them, you are not 
alone. This picture is famously known as Hermann's Grid. It's an example 
of a physiological illusion, which causes the observer to witness an 
object or image that isn't actually present in reality; however our 
brain fills in and provides us with extraneous or incorrect information.
</p><p>

Let's examine our visual system at the cellular level. This diagram 
below shows how a retinal ganglion cell might respond at each of these 
locations in the grid. (A ganglion cell is a type of neuron found in the 
retina that receives cascades of visual input from other cells. It is 
organized into a "center" (inner circle) and a "surround" (outer 
circle).<br />
 
<center><img src="gif/gangrc.jpg" width="622" height="350" alt="ganglion on off">
</center>

In the diagram, the color green indicates areas in the ganglion cell's 
receptive field that have been stimulated by light and yellow represents 
non-stimulated regions. However, an important distinction to make is 
that only the cells in the center are excited by light; cells in the 
surround that have been stimulated actually act as inhibitory signals. 
Ganglion cell 1 has 10 out of 16 total inputs that have been stimulated 
by light. Looking at the center we see 8 excitatory inputs and 2 
inhibitory inputs in the surround, which marks a net of 6 stimulated 
excitatory neurons. As a result, we see bright white lines here. 
On the other hand if we take a look at ganglion cell 2, there are no inputs 
that have been stimulated by light, so we see a black background.  
</p><p>

Lastly, ganglion cell 3 at the intersection shows 12 out of 16 total 
inputs that have been stimulated by light. Looking at the center we see 
8 excitatory inputs and 4 inhibitory inputs in the surround. Recall that 
ganglion cell 1 had a net 6 stimulated inputs but here there is only a 
net of 4 stimulated neurons, leading the intersection to appear darker 
than it actually is. </p>
<p>

Notice that if you try to focus on one of the intersections, the grey 
dot disappears. This is because the point of our central vision (the 
fovea) has extremely high resolution. Ganglion cells close to the fovea 
have smaller receptive fields and therefore fewer inhibitory inputs. As 
a result, we are able to see the black and white more clearly. </p>

<h3>Cognitive Illusions?</h3>

<p><img src="gif/vi5n.jpg" class="flr" width="280" height="257" alt="Penrose Triangle">
 Lastly, we will discuss cognitive illusions. Unlike literal or 
physiological illusions, cognitive illusions result not from any faulty 
transmission of information or subjective perceptions in our brains, but 
rather because they confuse our understanding of physics and math. The 
figure on the right shows one such example known as the Penrose 
Triangle.
</p>

<p>Try to imagine rolling a marble along the Penrose Triangle. You will 
find that following any path will bring you to each and every side, 
although looking at the whole figure that shouldn't be possible. 
</p>

<h3>The Purpose of Visual Illusions</h3>
<p>

While visual illusions are fun to play with, there is actually a 
practical reason for their perception. For instance, if you were to 
perceive every object in your view as a "figure" you would be 
overwhelmed with information. This would be extremely unhelpful if you 
were running from a predator because your brain would register each and 
every detail as equally important. This is difficult for us to picture 
in our brain because we are incredibly accustomed to focusing on one 
thing at a time, even if you are not aware of it. The very existence of 
visual illusions provides us with great insight into the visual system 
about how our brain processes information from the outside world. So the 
next time you see something that isn't there, stop and ask yourself: Am 
I really seeing it or is my brain playing a trick on me?

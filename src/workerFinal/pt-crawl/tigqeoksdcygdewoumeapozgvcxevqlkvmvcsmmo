      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3" color="#0000FF">Are 
        you a parent or doting grandparent, aunt or uncle considering giving a 
        child that reptile she or he has been begging you for? Do you know someone 
        considering buying a reptile for their child or niece or nephew, godchild, 
        grandchild or cousin? Encourage them to talk to the parents first...and 
        to encourage the parent to do some research into the suitability and care 
        requirements before they approve of such a gift.</font> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">The holidays are a time 
        of giving, but please, don't make a present of a living animal, especially 
        to children. Instead, why not make a gift of a book about an animal they 
        are interested in, the latest iguana care video, give them a gift subscription 
        to a herp magazine, or a gift certificate for books or equipment and supplies?</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Every year, unsuitable 
        mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians are given to people as gifts without 
        those people knowing the first thing about them. These animals either 
        die or languish in inappropriate environments for months or years before 
        they are finally given to someone else, often someone equally unprepared 
        to care for them properly. Worst, thousands are dumped every year on shelters, 
        herpetological societies, and reptile rescue groups, especially green 
        iguanas, Burmese pythons, red-tailed boas, and box and aquatic turtles.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Don't assume that the 
        parents of a child are willing or interested in caring for any pet, let 
        alone whatever exotic species you decide to get for your favorite niece, 
        nephew, or son or daughter living with your ex-spouse. No matter how well 
        you think you know the parents or the child, always ask the parents first, 
        and give them time - and species care information to read - to carefully 
        consider it. If they say no, please respect their wishes. It really is 
        a matter of life or death.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Animals are not disposable 
        playthings. They are a lifelong commitment - both the life of the owner 
        and the animal.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#0000FF">Charitable 
        Donations</font></b><br>
        Individuals and organizations who do animal rescue, housing and rehoming 
        of pet animals, as well as those involved strictly with domestic wildlife 
        rescue and rehab, are always in need of funds, equipment, and supplies. 
        If there is an organization your giftee is particularly supportive of, 
        or you know of one in need (and there isn't one that isn't in need!), 
        then consider making a donation of money or goods. Most such organizations 
        have a &quot;wish list&quot; of items they desperately need, with entries 
        ranging from food for their patients and residents, to enclosures, heating 
        and lighting supplies, veterinary supplies, etc. You will find many herp 
        rescues listed in my <a href="../../societies/index.html">Societies and 
        Rescues</a> page. To find rescues and wildlife rehabilitation centers 
        in your area (or your giftee's area) check with the humane society or 
        SPCA shelters in your area, or with your local reference library at the 
        public library. While some of these organization have a separate facility 
        and so are listed in the phone book, many are completely volunteer run 
        organizations. Reference librarians and the local volunteer center (check 
        the <i>County</i> listings in the phone book) usually keep comprehensive 
        lists of all nonprofit organizations in the area.</font> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#0000FF">Herp 
        Books</font></b><br>
        Every herper has a wish-list of books. Good herp books range from the 
        relatively inexpensive to huge, lush, coffee-table book-size encyclopedias 
        and atlases. For those with an interest in it and lots of species and 
        numbers to care for, reptile veterinary books are generally included on 
        their wish list. If you aren't certain of what book(s) they want or need, 
        you can always get and wrap up a booklist from one of the herp booksellers, 
        and include a note or gift certificate with it, inviting them to have 
        at it. For prospective herpers, if you know what types of species they 
        are considering getting but aren't familiar yourself with good books on 
        them, check with some knowledgeable herpers to get their recommendations 
        on titles.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">If you are buying a 
        book for a child, be sure to check with the children's librarian at the 
        public library for reptile and amphibian-related books suitable for the 
        child's age and development.</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#0000FF">Herp 
        Magazine Subscription</font></b><br>
        One great thing about herps is that we have only just been scratching 
        the surface of care, natural history, breeding and more. There are still 
        new species being discovered, eco-trips to new places, new things being 
        discovered about the behavior and care of species we thought we knew well. 
        Giving a herp keeper or prospective herper a year or two subscription 
        to a good <a href="../../resources/herpmagazines.html">herp magazine</a> 
        is literally a gift that will keep on giving. Not only will they find 
        the current issues interesting, and helpful in the keeping of their herps 
        or aid in the proper selection of future ones, but the issues will be 
        saves and referred to over the years. </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#0000FF">Herp 
        Society Membership</font></b><br>
        Many herpers feel isolated, not realizing that they are part of a larger 
        community of fellow herpers. Here is a way to help them get connected 
        with local folks and resources. For prospective herpers, belonging to 
        a <a href="../../societies/index.html">herp society</a> is a way of not 
        only getting connected but of meeting other herpers who keep the species 
        they are interested in, which ultimately may help them make the best decision 
        as to which one is best for them. Societies also provide a way in which 
        people who are interested in doing so can get involved in educating the 
        community at large about herps. While society memberships are not very 
        expensive, for students and others on a limited budget, a gift membership 
        is a gift that will bring interest, challenge and enjoyment for at least 
        a year.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#0000FF">Pet 
        Sitting and Go-fering</font></b><br>
        Sometimes our hearts exceed the depth of our bank accounts and so we must 
        be more creative in our gifting. Consider giving a card entitling the 
        bearer to a weekend, or even a week, of quality pet sitting (by you!) 
        while they go on a much-needed vacation or business trip. Or, volunteer 
        to make pet store runs for food and supplies, or to chauffeur herpers 
        who do not have ready access to a car and who may have a problem lugging 
        a sack full of rats or crickets on the bus or subway, especially during 
        the icy, snowy winter months. Equally needful are rides to the vets for 
        sick animals when the keeper doesn't have a car or can't take their 10 
        ft python or 4 ft iguana on the bus and taxis, for some reason, never 
        seem to find their address on time...</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">There are many things 
        herpers and prospective herpers will welcome. Just use your imagination 
        - and common sense - and the holidays should prove to be happy and healthy 
        for both the herper and their herps.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#0000FF">Pet 
        Store Gift Certificate<br>
        </font> </b> If the store your gift recipient regularly goes to does not 
        have gift certificates, you can easily create your own, by hand or on 
        the computer. Tuck it into a holiday card, decorate the envelope, and 
        voila! a safe and sane gift! The nice thing is that pet owners can use 
        the certificate to buy something their pets need, or special treats for 
        them they wouldn't otherwise buy, or they can apply it towards the purchase 
        of a future pet or pet supply purchase.</font></p>

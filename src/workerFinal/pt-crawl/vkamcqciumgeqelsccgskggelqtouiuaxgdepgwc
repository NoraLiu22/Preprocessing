/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<b><i>Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist.</i></b></center>
<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<center>
<font size="+1"><b>Chapter One. Belief and Spiritualism.</b></font></center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remain many uncertainties about Wallace's 
        various positions, but one thing we absolutely can be sure of is that 
        he was, for the majority of his adult life, a practicing spiritualist. 
        Theistically-inclined scientists have been by no means rare, of course; 
        on the other hand, relatively few scientists have attempted to advance 
        models of nature that directly integrate materialistic and spiritual elements. 
        Pierre Teilhard de Chardin immediately comes to mind as another name in 
        this arena, but in his case the theistic teleology invoked is easily seen 
        as both prior and explicit, and the materialism a derivative, if complementary, 
        device. In Wallace's work, by contrast, a logic-based naturalism is the 
        elemental component, but it is a naturalism so comprehensive as to directly 
        incorporate moral, ethical--and some would say, theistic--concerns. The 
        American philosopher Charles Peirce once referred to him in the following 
        wonderfully descriptive terms:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Not quite a typical man of science 
          is Wallace; not a man who observes and studies only because he is eager 
          to learn, because he is conscious that his actual conceptions and theories 
          are inadequate, and he feels a need of being set right; nor yet one 
          of those men who are so dominated by a sense of the tremendous importance 
          of a truth in their possession that they are borne on to propagate it 
          by all means that God and nature have put into their hands--no matter 
          what, so long as it be effective. He is rather a man conscious of superior 
          powers of sound and solid reasoning, which enable him to find paths 
          to great truths that other men could not, and also to put the truth 
          before his fellows with a demonstrative evidence that another man could 
          not bring out; and along with this there is a moral sense, childlike 
          in its candor, manly in its vigor, which will not allow him to approve 
          anything illogical or wrong, though it be upon his own side of a question 
          which stirs the depths of his moral nature.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></font></p>
   </blockquote>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among 
        Wallace's contemporaries only Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) could match 
        him in shear breadth of interest and creative energy. Unlike Spencer (who 
        Wallace once referred to as a &quot;thinking machine&quot;), however, Wallace's 
        attention was always focused on the world of actual events. He was one 
        of the most perceptive observers of his (or any) time, and this skill 
        was comprised equally of sympathetic, reasoning, and classificatory abilities. 
        His synthetic abilities were not so much strong as they were implicit, 
        flowing naturally from a powerful talent at reasoning things to their 
        elemental level, and abetted by an insatiable curiosity. Writer Frank 
        Harris, who knew him for many years, described him as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He was interested in every phase 
          of thought; the connection between mathematics and metaphysics, the 
          provoking laws that govern chances and regulate coincidences, the mysterious 
          movements of the human spirit by contradictories, by analogies, by merely 
          verbal dissonance and assonance, the gropings of consciousness in the 
          child, the senile decay of mind and memory, the higher law of sex unions--he 
          had studied all of them and said something worthful about most of them. 
          And under the panoply of knowledge his mind moved freely; he questioned 
          this axiom and rejected that much-vaunted conclusion without a shadow 
          of hesitation. Bit by bit he impressed me as some natural force impresses 
          despite its simplicity.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
   
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's 
        lack of formal education (he left school at age thirteen) and relatively 
        low social status were never any impediment to his personal progress as 
        a thinker. Lacking neither self-confidence nor courage in his convictions, 
        he was ever ready to take up a cause he thought was worth defending. Though 
        generally modest and self-effacing, he was willing to give at least one 
        frank appraisal of his abilities in his autobiography <em>My Life</em> 
        in 1905:</p>
      <blockquote>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...This rather long digression 
          may be considered to be out of place, but it is given in order to illustrate 
          the steps by which I gradually acquired confidence in my own judgment, 
          so that in dealing with any body of facts bearing upon a question in 
          dispute, if I clearly understood the nature of the facts and gave the 
          necessary attention to them, I would always draw my own inferences from 
          them, even though I had men of far greater and more varied knowledge 
          against me. Thus I have never hesitated to differ from Lyell, Darwin, 
          and even Spencer, and, so far as I can judge, in all the cases in which 
          I have so differed, the weight of scientific opinion is gradually turning 
          in my direction. In reasoning power upon the general phenomena of nature 
          or of society, I feel able to hold my own with them; my inferiority 
          consists in my limited knowledge, and perhaps also in my smaller power 
          of concentration for long periods of time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With Huxley also I felt quite 
          on an equality when dealing with problems arising out of facts equally 
          well known to both of us; but wherever the structure or functions of 
          animals were concerned, he had the command of a body of facts so extensive 
          and so complex that no one who had not devoted years to their practical 
          study could safely attempt to make use of them. I therefore never ventured 
          to infringe in any way on his special departments of study, though I 
          occasionally made use of some of the results which he so lucidly explained...<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></font></p>
      
      </blockquote>
     
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's 
        mental explorations led him to just as many interesting places as his 
        physical ones did. Certainly his association with spiritualism stands 
        at or near the top of the list in this regard. But previous attempts to 
        understand Wallace's attraction to spiritualism, and in turn its relation 
        to his thinking on other subjects, have largely ignored the very subject 
        that would make a sound appreciation possible. That subject is belief. 
        Wallace had, as it turns out, a well-developed position on the matter 
        of the relation of belief to observation, and it was a position that he 
        apparently held literally his entire adult life. It is the purpose of 
        this chapter to illuminate that position, and to show how it contributed 
        to several other key elements of his thinking.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most cogent 
        general analyses of Wallace's beliefs, particularly in reference to spiritualism, 
        and how these affected his later thinking on evolution and other subjects, 
        are by R. Smith (1972), Kottler (1974), Schwartz (1984), Oppenheim (1985), 
        and Malinchak (1987). Before we proceed further, a quick review of these 
        sources is in order.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Smith's essay 
        represented an important step forward in the understanding of Wallace's 
        work in general with its recognition of the interdependent nature of his 
        ideas: &quot;...Whereas it has been customary to consider his thought as primarily 
        biological and his digressions into phrenology, spiritualism, socialism, 
        and ethnology as peripheral, these apparently diverse subjects were in 
        reality aspects of a unified interpretation of the world in terms of humanitarian 
        values.&quot;<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> Smith decides that &quot;A consideration 
        of Wallace's philosophy of nature...leads to the conclusion that he saw 
        and intended no discontinuity between general and human evolution and 
        that it is a mistaken view to recognize such a discontinuity.&quot;<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> 
        Smith takes relatively little notice of Wallace's adoption of spiritualism 
        in his analysis, however, preferring to attribute his rejection of the 
        all-sufficiency of natural selection in particular to a posed incompatibility 
        of its logic with his utopian social views, especially to the extent that 
        the principle of utility could not be used to account for the higher human 
        faculties.</p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith's analysis is one of the most succinct descriptions 
      of Wallace's overall intellectual world view to date. Nevertheless, the 
      work does not address the sizable issue of how any of the strands of this 
      world view might have come together. For example, with respect to the effects 
      on his thinking of spiritualism in particular, he merely states &quot;...it is 
      not clear when or why he became involved with spiritualism.&quot;<sup><a href="#6">6</a> 
      </sup> Again: &quot;...it remains an historical problem to determine how far 
      the teleology of the later work was present in his thought during the earlier 
      period.&quot;<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup><br wp="BR1" />
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kottler spends a 
        goodly portion of his lengthy study on the special problem of the chronology 
        of Wallace's involvement with spiritualism and its effects on his thoughts 
        on evolution and the origin of man. He comes to the more directed conclusion 
        that Wallace's belief in psychical phenomena &quot;deeply influenced his evolutionary 
        thought;&quot;<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> i.e., that &quot;...spiritualism stimulated 
        Wallace to reconsider the utility of various human features&quot;<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> 
        and in turn became the efficient cause of his divergence of viewpoint 
        from Darwin on the issue of man's origins. Kottler also entertains--but 
        ultimately rejects as unlikely--two additional scenarios that might explain 
        Wallace's divergence from Darwin's views on man: (1) that he had &quot;two 
        independent grounds for his divergence--scientific and spiritual;&quot; i.e., 
        that he had &quot;<em>originally</em> concluded that natural selection was 
        inadequate in the origin of man on the basis of his utilitarian analysis 
        of various human features&quot;<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> and (2) that 
        &quot;the source of Wallace's recognition of natural selection's inadequacy 
        in the origin of man was his own conception of the nature of natural selection 
        rather than his belief in spiritualism.&quot;<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
     
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schwartz's essay is primarily concerned with 
        showing how Wallace's views on man might have pushed Darwin into writing 
        <em>The Descent of Man</em>, but he also gives attention to the spiritualism 
        issue, deciding that Wallace's position on man must have begun to shift 
        before he committed himself to spiritualism in 1865. He opines &quot;Wallace's 
        departure from the Darwinian point of view of the origin of man resulted 
        from his inability to bridge his scientific and moral beliefs;&quot;<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> 
        that &quot;Wallace's belief in social equality and political reform conflicted 
        with the ineluctable operations of natural law (including natural selection).&quot;<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup></p>
     
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oppenheim provides 
        an excellent overall review of Wallace's spiritualist leanings and activities, 
        dwelling on what she views as his inability to reject &quot;the dividing line 
        between science and spiritualism&quot; and desire to &quot;eliminate the aura of 
        the supernatural that clung to spiritualist phenomena.&quot;<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> 
        Still, she is unable to decide &quot;whether spiritualism alone can explain 
        Wallace's rejection of natural selection as the sole agent of evolutionary 
        change where the human race was concerned. Because he did not specifically 
        combine his spiritualist convictions with biological arguments until 1889, 
        he seemed to base his revised evolutionary views on considerations of 
        utility... It does appear that Wallace's doubts about natural selection 
        first arose from evidence acquired at the s&eacute;ance table, not from 
        biological or geological discoveries that forced him to reconsider his 
        initial theory of evolution in respect of humanity.&quot;<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malinchak examines 
        the story of Wallace's intellectual development from a largely sociological 
        perspective. Regarding the man/natural selection question, she advises 
        &quot;It was only after Wallace engaged in his extensive studies in spiritualism 
        and became convinced of the genuineness of spiritualistic phenomena that 
        he began to inject quasi-religious notions of the guidance of higher intelligences 
        in the development of the human mind into his scientific arguments.&quot;<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> 
        Malinchak nevertheless does not specifically refer Wallace's conversion 
        to spiritualism to causes rooted in his natural selection views, apparently 
        preferring to interpret it as a residual effect of some of his early experiences 
        with the supernatural, and of period social and intellectual trends.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other writers 
        who have contributed to the discussion include Tracy (1985), Barrow (1986), 
        Wiggins (1988), DeCarvalho (1988-1989), Scarpelli (1993), and Pels (1995).</p>
     
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize... 
        The position now generally held is that Wallace was led to spiritualistic 
        belief as a function of his final (perhaps disillusioned) inability to 
        view human evolution in entirely materialistic terms--in particular, as 
        the result of the limitations of natural selection. In this view, spiritualism 
        may have provided Wallace with a previously missing religious element 
        in his life--one which also explained (away) the intellectual and moral 
        development of the human race.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, 
        however, that these conclusions represent a mis-reading of the sum of 
        facts now available. My assessment of the situation is that Wallace had 
        from the very beginning been pursuing a course of investigation that inherently 
        (and, to a large extent, unwittingly) denied priority to materialistic 
        interpretations of nature, and that only through natural selection and 
        spiritualism was he able to forge a synthesis compatible with a naturalistic 
        kind of logic. Consistent with this idea, I shall take the position that 
        all events in Wallace's intellectual evolution after 1858 are entirely 
        predictable given conclusions he had reached by that year. We will begin 
        by reviewing the facts of Wallace's conversion to spiritualism.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is now well known 
        from both his own writings and secondary analysis,<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> 
        Wallace was first introduced to occult phenomena when he attended a lecture-demonstration 
        on mesmerism given by a Mr. Spencer Hall in 1844. Sometime earlier, he 
        had read George Combe and become interested in related phrenological subjects.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> 
        At that early date, there were few believers in mesmerism. Indeed, the 
        common opinion, especially within the scientific and medical communities, 
        was that its supposed physical manifestations were the stuff of hoax and 
        trickery. Wallace attended the lecture as a nonbeliever; shortly afterward, 
        however, he found himself able to induce the same effects that he had 
        witnessed on stage on subjects of his own choosing, and eventually became 
        a skilled practitioner of the art.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> This 
        had a profound effect on him, as he learned, in his own recollection, 
        &quot;my first great lesson in the inquiry into those obscure fields of knowledge, 
        never to accept the disbelief of great men, or their accusations of imposture 
        or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation 
        of facts by other men admittedly sane and honest.&quot;<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> 
        </p>
    
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Wallace, the implications of this &quot;great 
        lesson&quot; were profound. It forced its way into his thinking at two distinct, 
        but fully complementary, levels. In the more general sense, new discoveries--no 
        matter how unusual--were deserving of detached and rational study, not 
        ignorant, ill-informed disbelief. More specially and in particular, what 
        we would now term &quot;paranormal&quot; phenomena were not to be branded unworthy 
        of attention <em>a priori</em>. We may be quite sure that the overall 
        lesson was in fact both fully absorbed and later acted upon: Wallace argued 
        these points very frequently in his later works. One clear example is 
        afforded by statements incorporated into a short address he prepared for 
        his honorary appointment as President of the Department of Anthropology, 
        Section D, Biology, at the autumn 1866 meetings of the British Association 
        for the Advancement of Science. This address features the following cautionary 
        remarks:</p>
<blockquote>  
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now it is our object as anthropologists 
          to accept the well-ascertained conclusions which have been arrived at 
          by the students of all these various sciences, to search after every 
          new fact which may throw additional light upon any of them, and, as 
          far as we are able, to combine and generalize the whole of the information 
          thus obtained. We cannot therefore, afford to neglect any facts relating 
          to man, however trivial, unmeaning, or distasteful some of them may 
          appear to us. Each custom, superstition, or belief of savage or of civilised 
          man may guide us towards an explanation of their origin in common tendencies 
          of the human mind. Each peculiarity of form, colour, or constitution 
          may give us a clue to the affinities of an obscure race. The anthropologist 
          must ever bear in mind that, as the object of his study is <i>man</i>, 
          nothing pertaining to or characteristic of man can be unworthy of his 
          attention. It will be only after we have brought together and arranged 
          all the facts and principles which have been established by the various 
          special studies to which I have alluded, that we shall be in a condition 
          to determine the particular lines of investigation most needed to complete 
          our knowledge of man, and may hope ultimately to arrive at some definite 
          conclusions on great problems which must interest us all--the questions 
          of the origin, the nature, and the destiny of the human race. I would 
          beg you to recollect also that <i>here</i> we must treat all these problems 
          as purely questions of science, to be decided solely by facts and by 
          legitimate deductions from facts. We can accept no conclusions as authoritative 
          that have not been thus established. Our sole object is to find out 
          for ourselves what is our true nature, to feel our way cautiously, step 
          by step, into the dark and mysterious past of human history, to study 
          man under every phase and aspect of his present conditions, and from 
          the knowledge thus gained to derive (as we cannot fail to do) some assistance 
          in our attempts to govern and improve uncivilized tribes, some guidance 
          in our own national and individual progress.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace 
        had surely spent a considerable portion of his travel years mulling over 
        the basic validity of his &quot;great lesson,&quot; especially in its relevance 
        to the customs and beliefs of the many native peoples among whom he lived 
        and worked. Their religions, superstitions, and cosmological traditions 
        especially attracted his attention, and once he had returned to England 
        he made frequent use of his observations in subsequent writings. This 
        included &quot;great lesson&quot;-related commentary: Wallace's contempt for <em>a 
        priori</em> dismissal of native beliefs is implicit in the following passage 
        from his review of Edward Tylor's book <em>Primitive Culture</em> in 1872:</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...Equally unsatisfactory is 
          the practice of leaving out of view, in theories of mental development, 
          the numerous well-established cases of abnormal mental phenomena which 
          indicate latent powers in man beyond those usually recognised. These 
          are looked upon as obscure diseases of the nervous system, and although 
          their occurrence is very rare to individual experience, the records 
          of them are now sufficiently voluminous to furnish comparable cases 
          to almost all that occur. They can thus be grouped into classes, and 
          this fact, of each one forming an item in a group of analogous cases, 
          is supposed to preclude the necessity of any attempt at a rational explanation 
          of them. This is the method very largely adopted by Mr. Tylor, who in 
          treating of the beliefs, customs, or superstitions of mankind, seems 
          often to be quite satisfied that he has done all that is required when 
          he has shown that a similar or identical belief or custom exists elsewhere...</font></p>
      
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...It is therefore at least a 
        possible solution of the problem of animism, that the uniformity of <em>belief</em> 
        is due in great part to the uniformity of the underlying <em>facts</em>; 
        and a work on the development of religion and mythology should fairly 
        grapple with the question, &quot;How much of truth is at the bottom of the 
        so-called superstitious beliefs of mankind?&quot; But our author avoids all 
        such inconvenient enquiries by means of his infallible nostrum. A fact 
        or a belief occurring once only might require explanation, but if a second 
        or an analogous fact or belief can be found elsewhere, the whole thing 
        becomes clear. &quot;Second sight,&quot; for instance, occurs among savages as well 
        as in Scotland. Nothing more is required, according to Mr. Tylor, to prove 
        that it has no existence at all, except as a mere &quot;belief.&quot; Those curious 
        phenomena which have been recently investigated by Mr. Crookes and other 
        Fellows of the Royal Society, and which are declared to be realities by 
        members of the French Institute, by American judges and senators, and 
        by many medical and scientific men in this country, are treated in exactly 
        the same way. Something closely related to them is recorded by classical 
        writers, and occurs now among savage tribes. It is therefore clearly a 
        case of &quot;survival of old beliefs,&quot; and no further notice need be taken 
        of it. Mr. Tylor even goes so far as to say that for his purpose it really 
        matters little whether they are true or not. In order to arrive at true 
        results as to the origin, nature, and development of men's beliefs, it 
        matters not whether their foundation is fact or imagination! This belief 
        of Mr. Tylor seems to the present writer as completely an hallucination 
        as any to be found recorded in his volumes...</font></p>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...These examples (and many others 
          might be adduced) should teach us, that it is unsafe to deny facts which 
          have been vouched for by men of reputation after careful enquiry, merely 
          because they are opposed to our prepossessions. A work like the present, 
          one-sided though it be, furnishes much evidence to support the views 
          of those who maintain that a considerable portion of the so-called superstitions 
          of mankind repose upon facts; that these facts have been almost always 
          misunderstood and misinterpreted in past ages, as they are now by the 
          ignorant and among savages; and that, until they are recognised as possible 
          realities, and studied with thoroughness and devotion and a complete 
          freedom from foregone conclusions, it is hopeless to expect a sound 
          philosophy of religion or any true insight into the mysterious depths 
          of our spiritual nature.<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reply from Tylor 
        regarding what he viewed as a basic similarity between mesmerism and mediumistic 
        trances prompted further caustic remarks by Wallace the next week:</p>
<blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The two classes of phenomena, 
          therefore, differ fundamentally; and it is a most convincing proof of 
          Mr. Tylor's very slender acquaintance with either of them, that he should 
          even suggest their identity. The real connection between them is quite 
          in an opposite direction. It is the mediums, not the assistants, who 
          are &quot;sensitives.&quot; They are almost always subject to the mesmeric influence, 
          and they often exhibit all the characteristic phenomena of coma, trance, 
          rigidity, and abnormal sense-power. Conversely, the most sensitive mesmeric 
          patients are almost invariably mediums. The idea that it is necessary 
          for me to inform &quot;spiritualists&quot; that I believe in the power of mesmerisers 
          to make their patient believe what they please, and that this &quot;information&quot; 
          might &quot;bring about investigations leading to valuable results,&quot; is really 
          amusing, considering that such investigations took place twenty years 
          ago, and led to this important result--that almost all the most experienced 
          mesmerists (Prof. Gregory, Dr. Elliotson, Dr. Reichenbach, and many 
          others) became spiritualists!</font><sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor was the &quot;great 
        lesson&quot; of his youth forgotten in Wallace's later years. In his essay 
        &quot;The Birds of Paradise in the Arabian Nights&quot; in 1904 he remarks:</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">in the whole range of the Arabian 
          Nights...all its natural or magical journeys by land or by sea, all 
          its descriptions of countries and islands, and all its references to 
          their natural products or the customs of their inhabitants, are in every 
          case founded upon some more or less fragmentary or misunderstood observations 
          of the facts of nature, distorted in proportion to the number of transmissions 
          they have passed through, overlaid by a mass of magic and mystery due 
          to the exuberance of the Eastern imagination, but always, when these 
          various sources of error are fairly allowed for, showing, to the careful 
          enquirer, the original substratum of truth.<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>     
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, even from stories &quot;overlaid by a mass of magic&quot; 
      one could, with careful consideration, glean important truths.<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup> 
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        *</font></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the turn of mind just described, it is 
        less surprising <em>a priori</em> that not long after his return to England 
        in 1862 Wallace began to look into the by-then well-established, but still-growing, 
        spiritualism movement. Just <em>how</em> long after his return this effort 
        began, however, has remained an unresolved question. The chronology of 
        his adoption of spiritualism--whether Wallace was predisposed against 
        uninformed disbelief or not--is important, because it bears directly on 
        the state of his thoughts on human evolution during this critical period 
        in his life, and especially on the rationale for certain wordings in his 
        influential 1864 essay on the origin of human races, &quot;The Origin of Human 
        Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced From the Theory of 'Natural Selection'.&quot;<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup> 
        Malcolm Kottler refers the beginning of Wallace's interest to the year 
        1865, stating &quot;...from 1862 to 1865 there is no evidence of any interest 
        by Wallace in spiritualism.&quot;<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup> But it should 
        be noted that Wallace himself specifically pointed to the year 1862 on 
        at least one occasion: as part of his testimony in 1907 in the fraud trial 
        of medium J. N. Maskelyne;<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup> he also rather 
        vaguely refers to 1862 in a late interview:</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When I returned from abroad I 
          had read a good deal about Spiritualism, and, like most people, believed 
          it to be a fraud and a delusion. This was in 1862. At that time I met 
          a Mrs. Marshall, who was a celebrated medium in London, and after attending 
          a number of her meetings, and examining the whole question with an open 
          mind and with all the scientific application I could bring to bear upon 
          it, I came to the conclusion that Spiritualism was genuine. However, 
          I did not allow myself to be carried away, but I waited for three years 
          and undertook a most rigorous examination of the whole subject, and 
          was then convinced of the evidence and genuineness of Spiritualism.<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second interview, from 1904, includes the unsupported 
      statement that &quot;from the year 1863, from the very beginning of his scientific 
      career... [he] has been the avowed champion of spiritualism.&quot;<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup> 
      In both <em>My Life</em><sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup> and the 1875 sketch 
      &quot;Notes of Personal Evidence,&quot;<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup> moreover, he 
      notes that he was aware of writings on spiritualist phenomena even while 
      traveling in the East; that is, before 1862. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But &quot;Notes of Personal 
        Evidence&quot; also contains the seemingly definitive statement &quot;It was in 
        the summer of 1865 that I first witnessed any of the phenomena of what 
        is called Spiritualism, in the house of a friend.&quot;<sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup> 
        In the same work (p. 135) he mentions that the first of his several visits 
        with the spiritualist medium Mrs. Marshall took place in September 1865; 
        he also refers (p. 139) the initiation of his sittings with Miss Nichols, 
        another medium, to November 1866. The date 1865 can also be inferred from 
        testimony Wallace provided during the Henry Slade trial of late 1876: 
        &quot;I have been investigating this subject for eleven years,&quot;<sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup> 
        and from a letter of his printed in the London <em>Times</em> of 4 January 
        1873: &quot;I began the investigation about eight years ago...&quot;<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More interesting, 
        perhaps, is a passage reported in an interview printed in <em>The Bookman</em> 
        in January 1898:</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When I returned from abroad in 
          1862 I read about spiritualism, and, like most people, thought it all 
          imposture, delusion, idiocy. I met people, apparently intelligent and 
          sane, who assured me they had experienced wonderful things. Mrs. Marshall 
          was as that time a celebrated medium in London, and after close examination 
          I became convinced that the phenomena associated with her were perfectly 
          genuine. But it took three years' further investigation to satisfy me 
          that they were produced by spirits.<sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
        words introduce a new and important complication that needs to be addressed. 
        If one takes them as accurately representing the matter, Wallace may well 
        have begun attending seances (at least Mrs. Marshall's) in September 1865, 
        but then taken another two or three years to fully adopt the spiritualist 
        explanation for what he was witnessing. Otherwise put, it took him a while 
        to accept the evidence of his senses--after first deciding to allow the 
        evidence of his senses a sizable say in the matter. This turns out to 
        be, as we shall see, a most reasonable interpretation of the entire related 
        chronology of events, and it is somewhat surprising that no one has explored 
        it to any extent thus far. The alternative view--that Wallace more or 
        less suddenly began investigating seance phenomena <em>at the same time 
        he became a believer</em>--seems, even in the absence of any other kind 
        of information, unlikely <em>a priori</em>.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, we 
        are left with a several year period (roughly, 1864 to 1869) during which 
        Wallace was apparently exploring spiritualism-related concerns for uncertain 
        reasons. It would appear that these reasons cannot be satisfactorily identified 
        on the basis of Wallace's words alone, but fortunately additional kinds 
        of evidence can be brought to bear. Malinchak (1987) has pointed out that 
        it is logical to expect that Wallace's investigations could only have 
        reached a consuming level after 1865, at which point his natural history 
        collections would have been demanding less of his time. The actual record 
        of his publication activities supports this theory; between May 1862 and 
        December 1864 he produced thirteen works of systematic revision, but in 
        1865 only three, and in 1866, one. Still, he was not so busy during this 
        period that he was unable to give attention to other subjects--between 
        May 1862 and December 1864 he published at least thirteen additional writings, 
        in 1865 four, and in 1866 six.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further significant clue bearing on this matter 
        comes from a very obscure published source. Volume 1 No. 1 of <em>The 
        Spiritual News</em> of 1 December 1870 contains a short note describing 
        discussion that followed the presentation of Wallace's first public address 
        on spiritualism, &quot;An Answer to the Arguments of Hume, Lecky, and Others, 
        against Miracles&quot; (S174). The chairperson of the proceedings, a leading 
        spiritualist writer and publisher named Benjamin Coleman, is quoted in 
        this source as having stated on that occasion that &quot;it was just five years 
        ago&quot; that he (Coleman) began the series of meetings which Wallace's address 
        continued, and that at &quot;the very first meeting held in that room in connection 
        with Spiritualism, Mr. Wallace was present as a strong disbeliever.&quot; That 
        meeting, at which the eminent lecturer Emma Hardinge spoke, took place 
        on 6 November 1865.<sup><a href="#37">37</a></sup> This supports the position 
        that as of late 1865, Wallace was still, at the very least, uncommitted.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is additionally revealing to note that over 
        the twelve month period July 1865 to June 1866 only one of Wallace's publications 
        (S114) was of any real length (and this, a systematics work on pigeons 
        published in October 1865, might very well have been written some number 
        of months earlier). Further, in a letter to Darwin dated 2 October 1865 
        he writes: &quot;...I am ashamed of my laziness. I have done nothing lately 
        but write a paper on Pigeons for the <em>Ibis</em>...&quot;<sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup> 
        During this period, therefore, he really did significantly curtail his 
        writing activities, and, one suspects, was probably engaged in various 
        &quot;spiritualism investigation&quot; efforts. The final confirmation of this surmise 
        may be found in the pattern of Wallace's attendance of scientific meetings 
        over the period 1862 through 1867. On returning to English soil in the 
        Spring of 1862, Wallace was apparently eager to get himself involved in 
        the various scientific discussions of the day. Within a month he was beginning 
        to attend scientific meetings of professional societies, and over the 
        next five years may have been present at as many as a hundred or more 
        of these, sitting quietly and listening, or contributing papers and discussion. 
        In all seven organizations were involved: the Zoological Society of London, 
        the Royal Geographical Society, the British Association for the Advancement 
        of Science, the Ethnological Society of London, the Anthropological Society 
        of London, the Entomological Society of London, and the Linnean Society 
        of London. I have chronologically charted out Wallace's attendance at 
        meetings over the 1862 through 1867 period, and made the following interesting 
        discovery: between the middle of June 1865 and the middle of June 1866 
        Wallace attended only one meeting held by any of these seven bodies (on 
        4 July 1865 he attended a meeting of the Ethnological Society and commented 
        on a paper on phrenology--see <a href="S113A.htm">S113a</a>). This, despite 
        the fact that in both the preceding and following one year periods he 
        attended and spoke at a minimum (that is, contributed a paper or discussion 
        to the meeting) of eleven. Clearly, around May 1865 he had made a conscious 
        decision to re-orient his priorities for the time being.<sup><a href="#39">39</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize, although it remains quite possible 
        that Wallace actually did begin giving at least some attention to spiritualism 
        very soon after his return from the East, it was apparently three years 
        or more before he really started taking the subject to heart. There can 
        be no question, however, that by early or mid-1866 he had crossed the 
        line in this respect. &quot;The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural,&quot; a lengthy 
        (nearly monographic) essay on the subject, was composed no later than 
        in the early to mid-summer of that year. The history of the execution 
        of this work is unknown; in the Preface to the first edition of <em>On 
        Miracles and Modern Spiritualism</em> (S717) Wallace merely comments that 
        it had been &quot;written in 1866 for the pages of a Secularist periodical.&quot;<sup><a href="#40">40</a></sup> 
        It appears that, in contrast with the better known &quot;A Defence of Modern 
        Spiritualism&quot; (S243)--composed at the request of editor John Morley of 
        the <em>Fortnightly Review</em> after the leadership of the journal <em>The 
        Spiritualist</em> had appealed to him to invite Wallace to discuss the 
        subject<sup><a href="#41">41</a></sup>--the earlier study was prepared 
        at Wallace's own initiation. Some considerable effort was required to 
        determine that it first appeared in print between 11 August and 29 September--in 
        installments--in a weekly called <em>The English Leader</em>. Shortly 
        after this initial run was completed it was reprinted as a pamphlet for, 
        as Wallace put it, &quot;private circulation.&quot;<sup><a href="#42">42</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kottler (1974) provides 
        a long and excellent description, taken largely from <em>My Life</em>, 
        of Wallace's attempts at this time to get his colleagues to investigate 
        spiritualism on their own. &quot;The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural&quot; 
        figured centrally in these efforts. Through it Wallace hoped that he could 
        show that the subject was worthy of a scientific approach. The subtitle 
        of the work is given as: &quot;indicating the desirableness of an experimental 
        enquiry by men of science into the alleged powers of clairvoyants and 
        mediums.&quot; Indeed, the entire work, fifty-seven pages in length, may be 
        read as an argument to this effect. Wallace starts by advancing that &quot;the 
        apparent miracle may be due to some yet undiscovered law of nature,&quot; then 
        continues on to describe the various ways of looking at the phenomena 
        involved as being &quot;natural.&quot; Anecdotal evidence is then presented in quantity 
        from prominent persons one might suppose to have been dependable sources. 
        The work wraps up with discussions of the theory and moral teachings of 
        spiritualism--ostensibly in an effort to show why it is worth taking the 
        time to get involved with the subject at all.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the publication date of this work, 
        and the other evidence presented earlier, Wallace's final decision to 
        publicly promote spiritualism as a subject worthy of investigation may 
        thus be narrowed down to the window of time encompassing the first several 
        months of 1866. Still, it cannot be concluded from this chronology that 
        by that time he had actually fully embraced the belief. Recalling the 
        passage from the interview printed in <em>The Bookman</em>, given above, 
        and the fact that through 1866 and 1867 he continued to attend seances, 
        it is more likely that he waited another three years before finally accepting 
        the validity of the phenomena. Apart from Kottler (1974), who alludes 
        to this but does not develop the idea to any extent, investigators have 
        generally ignored the possibility that Wallace might have gone through 
        a two stage process in adopting spiritualism. It took him about a year 
        (early or mid 1865 to early or mid 1866) to come to the decision that 
        spiritualism was worthy of peer-involving close study; over the following 
        two to three years he continued to aggressively investigate the subject 
        (including looking into the physical evidence of spirits) until reaching 
        a point (late 1868 or early 1869) of actually wholeheartedly embracing 
        the belief himself.<sup><a href="#43">43</a></sup> This common-sensical 
        understanding of his chronology of interest is in fact sustained by the 
        various pieces of evidence presented above, and is further supported by 
        the fact that his first publically expressed dissension from Darwinian 
        views on human nature took place at the British Association for the Advancement 
        of Science meetings in September 1868. This was followed several months 
        later by the famous <em>Quarterly Review</em> article of April 1869 in 
        which his divergent views were more dramatically made known.<sup><a href="#44">44</a></sup></p>
     
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have a good 
        deal more to say on the matter of Wallace's conversion in Chapter Five, 
        especially as events of 1865 through 1869 contributed to his decision 
        to embrace spiritualism at that particular time.</p>
      
      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</font></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far so good, 
        but appreciation of the ultimately more important matter--the philosophical 
        context of Wallace's conversion--has been dogged by a lack of attention 
        to three important matters. These are: (1) the likely mis-assumption that 
        his &quot;investigation&quot; of spiritualism consisted largely or only of &quot;field 
        work,&quot; as it were, in the realm of mediated seance; (2) a general lack 
        of acquaintance with the moral tenets of spiritualism and the possible 
        grounds for accepting them; and (3) the very real possibility that Wallace's 
        model of natural selection had never been conceived to treat of man's 
        spiritual development, and that his evolutionary synthesis was still incomplete 
        at the time he was first fully exposed to pertinent spiritualist beliefs 
        and phenomena.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot doubt, 
        on the basis of dozens of separate references from himself and others, 
        that Wallace's &quot;investigation&quot; of spiritualism in the 1860s and afterward 
        included his attending numerous seances. Further, there is every reason 
        to believe that through this experience he gained a first-hand acquaintance 
        with the range of supposed spiritualistic &quot;contact phenomena&quot; (e.g., spirit 
        materializations, apports, table-rappings, automatic slate-writing, etc.). 
        Whether these experiences were &quot;genuine&quot; can of course be debated, but 
        such discussion serves little purpose here: the question, rather, is what 
        Wallace believed, and how such belief led him down the path he eventually 
        followed. Especially to the point, why was he willing to &quot;go public&quot; with 
        his support for investigating spiritualism before he had attained a convincing 
        (to him, at least) level of control on his own experimentation?</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been made 
        in the literature of the history of the spiritualism movement of the gullibility 
        of those who attended seances. Unquestionably, a good deal of fraud was 
        going on, and probably Wallace's and other scientists' attempts to provide 
        controlled experimental settings as often as not were not up to the level 
        of sophistication of the deception. In Wallace's defense, however, it 
        should be noted that a number of the early sittings he took part in were 
        carried out in his own lodgings. Further, some of the people Wallace investigated 
        were friends of the family and/or amateurs who did not charge fees.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole of the debate regarding genuineness 
        is in the last word largely immaterial: Wallace did in fact adopt the 
        belief, the real question of import being why he did so, and why so many 
        others (the vast majority of whom were unwilling to go to such extreme 
        ends to examine the question) did not. Certainly it must be admitted that 
        in one sense or another Wallace was predisposed to accepting--absolutely--what 
        his eyes suggested was so. Charles Peirce once justly described him as 
        believing &quot;in all he believes down to the very soles of his boots.&quot;<a href="#45"><sup>45</sup> 
        </a>Peirce (whose opinion on this matter surely should be treated with 
        some respect) also describes him as &quot;a great scientific reasoner...where 
        he differs most from received opinions his arguments are in general the 
        most carefully considered and consequently the strongest.&quot;<sup><a href="#46">46</a></sup> 
        But in the same work Peirce also states: &quot;yet his narrow training has 
        rendered him an easy mark for whatsoever evil spirit there may be, personal 
        or not, that beguiles men into sophistries, confusions, and rash assumptions.&quot;<sup><a href="#47">47</a></sup></p>
     
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all too easy, 
        however, to leap to the facile conclusion that Wallace was simply, in 
        Peirce's terms, &quot;beguiled.&quot; As noted earlier, the common wisdom on this 
        matter has it that Wallace was experiencing profound second thoughts on 
        the validity of natural selection (for either, or both, scientific or 
        moral reasons) and was looking for a way out of the dilemma. In my opinion 
        this point of view represents a half-truth only. Instead, it appears to 
        me that Wallace's acceptance of spiritualism turned neither on his biological 
        studies nor on the decisiveness of his seance experiences, but ultimately 
        on the long-term implications of his lifelong convictions on the nature 
        of belief.</p>
     
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In defending this 
        assertion, I need first point out that Wallace's investigation of spiritualism 
        extended to more than personal observation of the feats of mediums. It 
        was not Wallace's habit to leap into a discussion without thoroughly preparing 
        himself first; in fact, judging from statements gleaned from several sources,<sup><a href="#48">48</a></sup> 
        he invariably began the investigation of any new subject with an exhaustive 
        literature review. In this instance it appears he again read everything 
        he could &quot;lay his hands on&quot; as--or possibly or probably before--he undertook 
        his intensive program of seance attendance.<sup><a href="#49">49</a></sup> 
        Consistent with this knowledge, Wallace's writings on spiritualism--including 
        &quot;The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural,&quot; written rather early on with 
        respect to his overall program of seance attendance--do in fact display 
        the same commanding knowledge of the related literature that is evident 
        in his treatments of other subjects.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this literature 
        review he would have learned not only of the phenomena associated with 
        purported contacts with spirit beings, but of the relevance of these to 
        the philosophical, historical and moral teachings of the movement as well. 
        Research on Wallace's association with spiritualism has unfortunately 
        usually emphasized the sensationalism attached to his seance experiences 
        instead of getting to the heart of what it was that attracted him to the 
        belief to begin with. I have already mentioned how Wallace's &quot;The Scientific 
        Aspect of the Supernatural&quot; contained argumentation designed to assure 
        potential investigators of the subject that they were dealing with truly 
        &quot;natural&quot; phenomena. This is by no means the only place in which he makes 
        this point, however. Related arguments also permeate his other two most 
        significant writings on spiritualism, &quot;A Defence of Modern Spiritualism,&quot; 
        and &quot;An Answer to the Arguments of Hume, Lecky, and Others, Against Miracles.&quot; 
        Further examples may be found in several other of his writings. For example, 
        there is the following passage from the 1885 essay &quot;Are the Phenomena 
        of Spiritualism in Harmony With Science?&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now, modern Spiritualism rests 
          solely on the observation and comparison of facts in a domain of nature 
          which has been hitherto little explored, and it is a contradiction in 
          terms to say that such an investigation is opposed to science. Equally 
          absurd is the allegation that some of the phenomena of Spiritualism 
          &quot;contradict the laws of nature,&quot; since there is no law of nature yet 
          known to us but may be apparently contravened by the action of more 
          recondite laws or forces. Spiritualists observe facts and record experiments, 
          and then construct hypotheses which will best explain and co-ordinate 
          the facts, and in so doing they are pursuing a truly scientific course.<sup><a href="#50">50</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This insistence on the &quot;naturalness&quot; of spiritualism 
      forces us to confront the notion that it is not a religion--at least not 
      in the usual sense of that term. Thus &quot;The spiritualist, though he does 
      not claim infallibility, believes he is dealing with facts; he insists that 
      his faith is constructed to conform to the facts, as contrasted with a change 
      of facts to conform to faith.&quot;<sup><a href="#51">51</a></sup> This basis 
      in what might be described as &quot;psycho-naturalism&quot; places spiritualism squarely 
      within the realm of theosophy. <i>Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary</i> 
      defines &quot;theosophy&quot; in its more specific sense as &quot;the beliefs of a modern 
      movement originating in the United States in 1875 and following chiefly 
      Buddhist and Brahmanic theories especially of pantheistic evolution and 
      reincarnation.&quot;<sup><a href="#52">52</a></sup> Theosophy is actually not 
      markedly in disagreement with materialist interpretations of evolution; 
      in fact, it elucidates a process that both incorporates it, and extends 
      beyond it.<sup><a href="#53">53</a></sup> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significantly, the 
        view expressed in spiritualist (and other theosophical) writings is that 
        the chain of natural causality extends continuously, and back and forth, 
        between the psychic (i.e., aspatial) and physical (i.e., spatial) domains. 
        The sensational manifestations of this continuity allegedly occurring 
        during seances and analogous conditions are, it has usually been supposed, 
        the only aspects of it whose causes might readily be distinguished from 
        the ordinary &quot;material&quot; phenomena of nature. Wallace and other spiritualists 
        argued that the evidence for at least some of the &quot;miracles&quot; that have 
        allegedly occurred throughout human history is quite satisfactory, but 
        that such events represent products of a natural (i.e., non-&quot;miraculous&quot;), 
        continuing interaction with &quot;spirit beings&quot; rather than otherwise wholly 
        inexplicable first causes. Miracles were thus assigned natural causes--if 
        one could accept that causal continuity in this instance was maintained 
        by yet poorly understood, but nevertheless real, forces.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's (and many 
        other investigators') interest in such contact phenomena was primarily 
        that there appeared to be no other avenue through which the subject could 
        be explored objectively. Most spiritualists undoubtedly adopted the belief 
        on faith (i.e., that observable &quot;spirit manifestations&quot; 
        indicated that the &quot;spirit realm&quot; actually existed) and on the strength 
        of its moral teachings. The more strictly personal experiences some claimed 
        to have had (involving, for example, Swedenborgian out-of-body travel), 
        even if thought to have natural causes, did not seem to lend themselves 
        to the methods of scientific investigation available at that time.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to argue, 
        of course, that many believers in spiritualist doctrines are not pursuing 
        additional agendas. To this day there are many who through guilt or innocent 
        concern will do whatever they feel they must to alleviate personal pain--including, 
        for example, attempts to contact deceased relatives--and such needs have 
        often opened the gates for unscrupulous opportunists. Wallace himself 
        has occasionally been marginalized as turning to spiritualism in an effort 
        to bring closure of this sort: his younger brother Herbert had died while 
        in the Amazon during a probably misguided effort to turn him into a professional 
        natural history collector, and it has been supposed by some that Wallace's 
        adoption of spiritualism was related to this painful incident in his life. 
        I think this is a ridiculous inference. Apart from the fact that he never 
        reports any such contact intentions in his writings (nor any results), 
        the overall program of Wallace's life was not of such narrow dimension 
        as to have left him prone to manipulation stemming from such an event, 
        painful though it was to him. Wallace's agenda had to do with evolution, 
        and any and all forces that might contribute to it--including spirits.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's recognition 
        of the principle of natural selection in 1858 forced the then thirty-five 
        year old naturalist into the unanticipated role of celebrity. There is 
        nothing in the Ternate essay (or his subsequent recollections of its writing<sup><a href="#54">54</a></sup>), 
        however, to indicate he foresaw the degree and immediacy of natural selection's 
        impact on the intellectual community. The main reason for this, I suggest, 
        is that at that time he considered the concept only a partial solution 
        to a more general set of problems he had been working on for about fifteen 
        years. The remainder of the solution--as a continuation, not reversal, 
        of thought--occurred to him only as he became familiar with the writings 
        of spiritualism. It was almost certainly the moral, historical and philosophical 
        themes of the belief and their relation to the subject of natural causation 
        that really attracted him to the movement. In these themes he recognized 
        an informal characterization of natural processes which operated in a 
        manner transcending, yet complementing, natural selection. These views 
        were acceptable to Wallace because they were consistent with his Rationalist 
        approach to the assessment of evidence, his position on the meaning of 
        continuity of cause and effect, and the generally &quot;progressive&quot; attitude 
        he had maintained since adolescence.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace distilled 
        the teachings of spiritualism in a number of his later writings. Excerpts 
        from several of these follow for the sake of illustration and later reference: 
        </p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...The universal teaching of 
          modern spiritualism is that the world and the whole material universe

          simply a transition from material existence to the first grade of spirit-life--and 
          that our happiness and the degree of our progress will be wholly dependent

          and moral nature, or starved it by disuse, shall we be well or ill fitted

          in a world in which there are no physical wants to be provided for, 
          no struggle to maintain mere existence, no sensual enjoyments except 
          those directly associated with sympathy and affection, no occupations 
          but those having for their object social, moral, and intellectual progress--is

          and wholesome food produce health of body, so surely does a moral life 
          here produce health and happiness in the spirit-world...<sup><a href="#57">57</a></sup>

          while the oppression and wrong, the ignorance and crime, the misery 
          and pain, that always and everywhere pervade the world, have been the 
          means of exercising and strengthening the higher sentiments of justice,

</blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        preceding selections feature the following essential ideas: (1) the human 
        being's full span of individual existence extends onward to a period following 
        biological death; (2) the characteristics of conscious existence during 
        this alleged later period are determined primarily by the level of intellectual 
        and moral development attained during one's biological life experience; 
        (3) this intellectual and moral development is a function of the degree 
        of willful rejection of materialistic, self-centered goals and the adoption 
        of an explorative, non-pre-judging, and socially-conscious attitude; and 
        (4) there is, overall, a continuity of just cause and effect in nature 
        which cannot for long be circumvented, and which complements individual 
        action, sooner or later, with no more nor less than a commensurate reaction. 
        Theme four would have been the one that most impressed Wallace initially. 
        We shall return to this subject in a moment.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevance of these four themes to Wallace's 
        adoption of spiritualism can be better appreciated after examining words 
        he set out some twenty years <em>before</em> being introduced to spiritualistic 
        phenomena (indeed, before the beginning of &quot;Modern Spiritualism&quot;--in 1848--itself<sup><a href="#60">60</a></sup>). 
        In late 1843, while employed as a surveyor for his older brother William, 
        Wallace composed (and apparently delivered) a lecture entitled &quot;The Advantages 
        of Varied Knowledge.&quot; Portions of the essay are reproduced and discussed 
        in his 1905 autobiography <em>My Life</em>. From this source<sup><a href="#61">61</a></sup> 
        the following significant passages may be noted:</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[on gaining &quot;a general acquaintance 
          with history, biography, art, and science&quot;:] ...There is an intrinsic 
          value to ourselves in these varied branches of knowledge, so much indescribable 
          pleasure in their possession, so much do they add to the enjoyment of 
          every moment of our existence, that it is impossible to estimate their 
          value, and we would hardly accept boundless wealth, at the cost, if 
          it were possible, of their irrecoverable loss. And if it is thus we 
          feel as to our general store of mental acquirements, still more do we 
          appreciate the value of any particular branch of study we may ardently 
          pursue... here we see the advantage possessed by him whose studies have 
          been in various directions, and who at different times has had many 
          different pursuits, for whatever may happen, he will always find something 
          in his surroundings to interest and instruct him...</font></p>

          the elementary laws of physical science&quot;:] ...He who has extended his

          and more imposing character. <i>He sees in every dewdrop trembling on

          the action of laws which may also have a part in the production of the

</blockquote>      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These passages reflect 
        the views of the then twenty year old Wallace on the reasons for--and 
        advantages of--pursuing an ongoing program of many-directioned self-education 
        and rational, moral and intellectual exploration. Nor are these the only 
        such remarks expressed by Wallace at this time. In the essay &quot;An Essay, 
        On the Best Method of Conducting the Kington Mechanic's Institution,&quot;<sup><a href="#63">63</a></sup> 
        probably composed even earlier (about 1841) but re-discovered only in 
        the late twentieth century, Wallace advises that </p>
<blockquote>     
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...it is the society's duty, 
          both to supply the materials for diffusion of scientific and historical

          much less on the whole range of human knowledge. By these alone, therefore, 
          curiosity is excited, but not satisfied, which state of feeling, if 
          long continued, generally leads to indifference or disgust. A library 
          of good and valuable books will obviate this, by giving each an opportunity

</blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        messages in these two early essays and the spiritualism-related excerpts 
        presented earlier have much in common with respect to the way they portray 
        the ideal &quot;life strategy;&quot; the only real difference, in fact, lies in 
        spiritualism's specific referral to an afterlife (&quot;Advantages...&quot; only 
        goes so far as to consider &quot;whatever new state of being the future may 
        have in store for us&quot;). In both sets of writings, moreover, appear the 
        essence of his belief in the connection between justice and natural causality, 
        and it is this connection that represents the cornerstone of his entire 
        life's work.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's scientific philosophy rests on two 
        basic ideas regarding the relation of cause to effect. The first is that 
        the occurrence of action--any action--unaccompanied by equal and commensurate 
        reaction is unthinkable. The doctrine of first causes therefore seemed 
        irrational to him: it accepted the notion of effect without relatable, 
        comprehendable cause. It is not clear exactly when this element of Wallace's 
        thinking first established itself, but his reading of Charles Lyell's 
        <em>Principles of Geology</em> in the mid 1840s possibly represented the 
        eventual deciding influence in the context of natural science. Lyell's 
        uniformitarian geological views provided Wallace with an understanding 
        of cause-and-effect that appealed only to continuously-acting and, importantly, 
        observable and verifiable, forces. It is likely, however, that the roots 
        of this kind of thinking in Wallace's mind extend much further back yet--perhaps 
        to the period of his contact with a London-based Owenite group in 1837, 
        as we shall discuss shortly.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully as central 
        to Wallace's cosmology as the &quot;equal and commensurate reaction&quot; concept, 
        however, were the implications stemming from his idea that &quot;just&quot; effect 
        emanated from cause. Supposing that only a limited range of &quot;equal and 
        commensurate&quot; reactions could derive from any given cause at any given 
        time, and accepting that the consequences of any given cause were more 
        or less restricted to some predominantly closed and limited domain (including 
        nature in general), it seemed reasonable to believe that such consequences 
        would eventually feed back on the agent of causation. Wallace considered 
        such feedback inevitable--and, as a truism, &quot;just&quot;--whether the reinforcement 
        involved was perceived as being of an immediately positive, constructive, 
        nature or not.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's utterly uniformitarian position on 
        the meaning of &quot;just&quot; reaction provided Wallace with a neutral starting 
        point for his ideas on all subjects. Consider, for example, his views 
        on morality. Those who could not see or understand the negative implications 
        of their own actions were merely amoral, and even the bad implications 
        themselves had the extenuating positive effect of providing instruction 
        for any outside party receptive enough to benefit from such consideration.<sup><a href="#67">67</a></sup> 
        The relative morality of behaviors could thus be assessed, with adoption 
        or rejection following as a function of considered appraisal. At the same 
        time, however--and most importantly--one should not think that new and 
        higher moral conceptions were constantly emanating from human beings <em>de 
        novo</em>; this contradicted his ideas on continuity of cause and effect. 
        Instead, such notions &quot;come to us--we hardly know how or whence, and once 
        they have got possession of us we can not reject or change them at will;&quot;<sup><a href="#68">68</a></sup> 
        i.e., they originate beyond the immediate domain of human consciousness, 
        and are merely &quot;applied&quot; (or better yet, &quot;redirected&quot;) through human action.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's position 
        on the role of &quot;just reaction&quot; in progressive society was given greater 
        focus when he read Herbert Spencer's <em>Social Statics</em> in 1853. 
        In <em>My Life</em> he writes:</p>
     <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Soon after I returned from the 
          Amazon (about 1853), I read Herbert Spencer's &quot;Social Statics,&quot; a work 
          for which I had a great admiration, and which seemed to me so important 
          in relation to political and social reform... the whole work, and more 
          especially the chapter on &quot;The Right to the Use of the Earth,&quot; made 
          a permanent impression on me.<sup><a href="#69">69</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Wallace 
        immediately latched onto Spencer's &quot;social justice&quot; concept. Spencer argued 
        that each individual should receive no more nor less--especially no more--than 
        was his or her just due, a position Wallace would fully endorse to the 
        end of his days. There is little difficulty understanding how this fit 
        into the &quot;Advantages...&quot; argument: social evolution had to be a progressive 
        function of the most intelligently and morally conceived actions (i.e., 
        causes). And, in fact, Wallace would later use such ideas as the foundation 
        for his views on land reform. As part of his annual Presidential address 
        to the Land Nationalisation Society in 1892 he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">soon after I returned from my 
          travels in the Amazon Valley, I read his book on <em>Social Statics</em>, 
          and from it first derived the conception of the radical injustice of 
          private property in land. His irresistible logic convinced me once for 
          all, and I have never since had the slightest doubt upon the subject. 
          He taught me, that &quot;to deprive others of their rights to the use of 
          the earth is to commit a crime inferior only in wickedness to the crime 
          of taking away their lives or their personal liberties&quot;; and when he 
          added, that however difficult it might be to find a practical means 
          of restoring the land to the people yet &quot;Justice sternly commands it 
          to be done,&quot; a seed was sown in my mind which long afterwards developed 
          into that principle of the separation of the inherent value of land 
          from the improvements effected in or upon it, which was the foundation 
          of the proposals in my article &quot;How to Nationalise the Land,&quot; and this 
          article led to my association with Mr. Swinton, Dr. Clark, and other 
          friends in the formation of our Society.<sup><a href="#70">70</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, 
        the concept of &quot;just reaction&quot; is not at its core a strictly morality-based 
        construct. Although one might apply it logically in many directions within 
        the social sphere to defend the rights of individuals--and Wallace did--it 
        more generally reduces to a statement about uniformitarian forms of causation: 
        the notion that event C can always be explained on the basis of the combination 
        of identifiable causes A and B interacting in some particular way. It 
        is not surprising, therefore, to find that Wallace's adoption of the principle 
        led him to parallel positions within the natural sciences. One of the 
        most significant of these from a conceptual standpoint is how he dealt 
        with instinct.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinct represented 
        a particularly difficult challenge for Wallace's point of view. Instinctive 
        reactions come close to appearing as though they had no immediate cause--that 
        is to say, are in some sense first causes. Wallace's approach to the matter 
        is at its core a defensive one: he usually attempts to argue that particular 
        instincts represent learned behaviors, and may thus be discounted as instinctual. 
        Consider the following excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...It has been generally the 
          custom of writers on natural history to take the habits and instincts 
          of animals as the fixed point, and to consider their structure and organization 
          as specially adapted to be in accordance with them. But this seems quite 
          an arbitrary assumption, and has the bad effect of stifling inquiry 
          into those peculiarities which are generally classed as &quot;instincts&quot; 
          and considered as incomprehensible, but which a little consideration 
          of the <em>structure</em> of the species in question, and the peculiar 
          physical <em>conditions</em> by which it is surrounded, would show to 
          be the inevitable and logical result of such structure and conditions. 
          I am decidedly of the opinion that in very many instances we can trace 
          such a necessary connexion, especially among birds, and often with more 
          complete success than in the case which I have here attempted to explain. 
          For a perfect solution of the problem we must, however, have recourse 
          to Mr. Darwin's principle of &quot;natural selection,&quot; and need not then 
          despair of arriving as a complete and true&quot;theory of instinct...&quot;<sup><a href="#71">71</a></sup></font></p>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...A fair consideration of all 
          these facts will, I think, fully support the statement with which I 
          commenced this article, and show that the mental faculties exhibited 
          by birds in the construction of their nests are the same in kind as 
          those manifested by mankind in the formation of their dwellings. These 
          are, essentially, imitation, and a slow and partial adaptation to new 
          conditions. To compare the work of birds with the highest manifestations 
          of human art and science is totally beside the question. I do not maintain 
          that birds are gifted with reasoning faculties at all approaching in 
          variety and extent to those of man. I simply hold that the phenomena 
          presented by their mode of building their nests, when fairly compared 
          with those exhibited by the great mass of mankind in building their 
          houses, indicate no essential difference in the kind or nature of the 
          mental faculties employed. If instinct means anything, it means the 
          capacity to perform some complex act without teaching or experience. 
          It implies innate ideas of a very definite kind, and, if established, 
          would overthrow Mr. Mill's sensationalism and all the modern philosophy 
          of experience. That the existence of true instinct may be established 
          in other ways is not improbable, but in the particular case of birds' 
          nests, which is usually considered one of its strongholds, I cannot 
          find a particle of evidence to show the existence of anything beyond 
          those lower reasoning powers which animals are universally admitted 
          to possess...<a href="#72"><sup>72</sup></a></font></p>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...It appears to me that instinct 
          should be defined as--&quot;the performance by an animal of complex acts, 
          absolutely without instruction or previously-acquired knowledge.&quot; Thus, 
          acts are said to be performed by birds in building their nests, by bees 
          in constructing their cells, and by many insects in providing for the 
          future wants of themselves or their progeny, without ever having seen 
          such acts performed by others, and without any knowledge of why they 
          perform them themselves. This is expressed by the very common term &quot;blind 
          instinct.&quot; But we have here a number of assertions of matters of fact, 
          which, strange to say, have never been proved to be facts at all. They 
          are thought to be so self-evident that they may be taken for granted. 
          No one has ever yet obtained the eggs of some bird which builds an elaborate 
          nest, hatched these eggs by steam or under a quite distinct parent, 
          placed them afterwards in an extensive aviary or covered garden, where 
          the situation and the materials of a nest similar to that of the parent 
          birds may be found, and then seen what kind of nest these birds would 
          build. If under these rigorous conditions they choose the same materials, 
          the same situation, and construct the nest in the same way and as perfectly 
          as their parents did, instinct would be proved in their case; now it 
          is only assumed, and assumed, as I shall show further on, without any 
          sufficient reason. So, no one has ever carefully taken the pup&aelig; 
          of a hive of bees out of the comb, removed them from the presence of 
          other bees, and loosed them in a large conservatory with plenty of flowers 
          and food, and observed what kind of cells they would construct. But 
          till this is done, no one can say that bees build without instruction, 
          no one can say that with every new swarm there are no bees older than 
          those of the same year, who may be the teachers in forming the new comb. 
          Now, in a scientific inquiry, a point which can be proved should not 
          be assumed, and a totally unknown power should not be brought in to 
          explain facts, when known powers may be sufficient. For both these reasons 
          I decline to accept the theory of instinct in any case where all other 
          possible modes of explanation have not been exhausted...<sup><a href="#73">73</a></sup></font></p>
    
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...In the chapter on the &quot;instinct 
          to use clothing,&quot; we have another example of our author's want of rigid 
          impartiality. He endeavours to show that some animals use clothing, 
          and that some men do not, and that it is, therefore, no distinctive 
          character of man. His examples of dressed animals are hermit crabs and 
          the larv&aelig; of <em>Phryganea</em> and <em>Tinea</em>; and although 
          he adduces instances of unclothed men, he has in no way accounted for 
          that sense of shame which he maintains is not innate, and which yet 
          has, even more than the necessity for warmth, led to the practice of 
          clothing among so many peoples...<sup><a href="#74">74</a></sup></font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...Mr. Morgan discusses at considerable 
          length the question of whether the effects of use and disuse are hereditary. 
          He admits the very imperfect character of the evidence in favour of 
          the proposition that they are so, and he adduces, as in his opinion 
          one of the best cases, &quot;the instinctive avoidance&quot; of nauseous and stinging 
          insects by most birds. As neither the nauseous taste nor the stings 
          are usually fatal, the avoidance of them is not of eliminating value, 
          and cannot, therefore, have been produced by natural selection. Hence 
          he thinks the inheritance of individual experience probable. But the 
          &quot;instinctive avoidance&quot; is here assumed, whereas there is now good reason 
          to believe that in the case of nauseous insects, and probably also of 
          stinging insects, the avoidance is the result of individual experience 
          or observation. Some of the most curious phenomena of mimicry can only 
          be explained on this hypothesis...<sup><a href="#75">75</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These examples, 
        from a more than thirty year period (1860-1892), by no means exhaust Wallace's 
        various considerations of the subject of instinct. As is especially clear 
        from the first of the five, Wallace felt that biological adaptation was 
        little more than the &quot;just&quot; result of the interplay of ambient biological 
        and environmental conditions; that is, a logical outcome of conceivable 
        forces. The weak or maladapted individual was less successful in passing 
        on its traits; the broadly adapted population tended to persist at the 
        expense of maladapted ones. These &quot;just results,&quot; however, were no more 
        than the logical implications of confining ecological realities. Biological 
        evolution, on the other hand, occurred as: (1) selection forces acted 
        on such pre-existing variation (i.e., the existing &quot;biological domain&quot;) 
        and (2) variation itself was introduced as a function of biological and 
        extra-biological forces of whose causes and actions we were still largely 
        ignorant. We will have more to say on this subject in the following chapters.</p>

        *</font></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general point 
        I wish to make here is that as of 1853 (or even 1843) the only feature 
        distinguishing Wallace's general philosophy of life from that later endorsed 
        by spiritualists was the latter's assignment of their rationale for moral 
        behavior to a specific <em>final</em> cause--the &quot;carrot&quot; of continuing 
        personal evolution in the &quot;afterlife.&quot; We need address a basic question 
        in this connection: Did Wallace in fact maintain fundamentally the same 
        philosophical perspective between 1843 and the date of his adoption of 
        spiritualism (about 1866)?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of Wallace's 
        subsequent activities, it can hardly be doubted that over the next two 
        decades he followed the advice offered in his 1841 and 1843 essays to 
        a tee. Certainly his experiments with mesmerism shortly thereafter attest 
        to his inquisitiveness, as do his later adoption of an evolutionary perspective 
        (as established by McKinney 1966 &amp; 1969) and explorations and natural 
        history and ethnological investigations in the tropics. In the last context 
        his appreciations of tropical peoples are particularly refreshing: he 
        avoided prejudgment, especially the trap of using the state of so-called 
        &quot;civilized Europe&quot; as a basis for assessing degree of moral advance in 
        other cultures.<sup><a href="#76">76</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentiment that 
        a many-directioned (and, when specifically referred to human beings, intelligently 
        and morally-directed) experience is fundamentally valuable to the individual 
        actually does consistently surface in Wallace's writings over the next 
        twenty years, and in a great variety of contexts. Take, for example, the 
        implied basis for his assessment of the relative level of civilization 
        attained by various native peoples: </p>
<blockquote>    
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Dyaks are more lively, more 
          talkative, and less diffident than the American [Indians], and therefore 
          pleasanter companions. They have more amusements and are more social, 
          while at the same time they have less variety of weapons, and are less 
          skilful in their methods of obtaining game and fish. Both these circumstances 
          will lead us to place them one degree higher in the scale of civilization... 
          Dyak youths...have their social games, their trials of strength and 
          skill... They possess...numerous puzzles and tricks with which they 
          amuse themselves... These apparently trifling matters are yet of some 
          importance, in arriving at a true estimation of their social state. 
          They show that these people have passed beyond that first stage of savage 
          life in which the struggle for existence absorbs their whole faculties, 
          in which every thought and every idea is connected with war or hunting 
          or the provision for their immediate necessities. It shows too an advanced 
          capability of civilization, an aptitude to enjoy other than mere sensual 
          pleasures, which, properly taken advantage of, may be of great use in 
          an attempt to raise their social and mental condition.<sup><a href="#77">77</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the following, on the &quot;robustness&quot; of natural 
      forms of selection: 
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the wild animal, on the contrary 
          [i.e., as contrasted with domesticated forms], all its faculties and 
          powers being brought into full action for the necessities of existence, 
          any increase [of power or capacity in an organ or sense] becomes immediately 
          available, is strengthened by exercise, and must even slightly modify 
          the food, the habits, and the whole economy of the race. It creates 
          as it were a new animal, one of superior powers, and which will necessarily 
          increase in numbers and outlive those inferior to it... Domestic animals 
          are abnormal, artificial; they are subject to varieties which never 
          occur and never can occur in a state of nature: their very existence 
          depends altogether on human care; so far are many of them removed from 
          that just proportion of faculties, that true balance of organization, 
          by means of which alone an animal left to its own resources can preserve 
          and continue its race.<sup><a href="#78">78</a></sup></font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general idea that many-directioned efforts are 
      likely to yield the most productive long-term results is evident in the 
      following selections--extending across the whole of Wallace's career--as 
      well:

          the mischief to them... It now becomes a question whether the supposed 
          criminals are not really our benefactors,--teaching us, by their presence, 
          that there is something wrong, before we could otherwise perceive it.

          in maintaining the struggle for life; others devote their leisure to 
          various forms of sport; while even those who are of a more reflective 
          nature, and take every opportunity afforded them for reading or for 
          the pursuit of some branch of science, are not thereby fitted to form 
          an independent judgment on the various difficult and controversial questions 
          which divide political parties. Nothing can give this but experience, 
          slowly and painfully gained through observation of, and contact with, 
          his fellow-men in the varied relations of life--in the capacity of buyer 
          and seller, of wage-earner or wage-payer, as juryman or witness, parish-councillor, 
          guardian, or any other capacity that brings him into active relations 
          with his fellows and enables him to form an opinion as to their intellectual 
          capacity or moral character. It may be safely stated that every five 
          years of added experience of this kind renders a man better fitted than 
          before to have a voice in choosing the legislative body, into whose 
          hands are committed the great issues of war or peace, of misery or well-being, 
          of oppression or of justice, for the whole nation. It therefore seems 
          to me to be one of the greatest of political errors to entrust this 
          important duty to the crude intelligence, the scanty experience, and 
          the usually prejudiced judgment of that portion of the citizens who 
          have only just emerged from a state of legal disability and educational 
          pupilage. The various considerations here set forth lead me to the conclusion 
          that in order to obtain the best judgment of the nation in the choice 
          of representatives, those only should vote who have attained the age 
          of forty years. This, of course, is so great a departure from what has 
          hitherto been the rule that it is not at all likely to be adopted, but 
          it seems to me that it expresses something like the ideal to be aimed 
          at...<a href="#90"><sup>90</sup></a></font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is the following passage from a letter 
      of 15 March 1861<sup><a href="#91">91</a></sup> to Wallace's brother-in-law, 
      Thomas Sims: 
      <blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...You intimate that the happiness 
        to be enjoyed in a future state will depend upon, and be a reward for, 
        our belief in certain doctrines which you believe to constitute the essence 
        of true religion. You must think, therefore, that belief is voluntary 
        and also that it is meritorious. But I think that a little consideration 
        will show you that belief is quite independent of our will, and our common 
        expressions show it. We say, &quot;I wish I could believe him innocent, but 
        the evidence is too clear;&quot; or, &quot;Whatever people may say, I can never 
        believe he can do such a mean action.&quot; Now, suppose in any similar case 
        the evidence on both sides leads you to a certain belief or disbelief, 
        and then a reward is offered you for changing your opinion. Can you really 
        change your opinion and belief, for the hope of reward or the fear of 
        punishment? Will you not say, &quot;As the matter stands I can't change my 
        belief. You must give me proofs that I am wrong or show that the evidence 
        I have heard is false, and then I may change my belief'?&quot; It may be that 
        you do get more and do change your belief. But this change is not voluntary 
        on your part. It depends upon the force of evidence upon your individual 
        mind, and the evidence remaining the same and your mental faculties remaining 
        unimpaired--you cannot believe otherwise any more than you can fly.</font></p>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Belief, then is not voluntary. 
          How, then, can it be meritorious? When a jury try a case, all hear the 
          same evidence, but nine say &quot;Guilty&quot; and three &quot;Not guilty,&quot; according 
          to the honest belief of each. Are either of these more worthy of reward 
          on that account than the others? Certainly you will say No! But suppose 
          beforehand they all know or suspect that those who say &quot;Not guilty&quot; 
          will be punished and the rest rewarded: what is likely to be the result? 
          Why, perhaps six will say &quot;Guilty&quot; honestly believing it, and glad they 
          can with a clear conscience escape punishment; three will say &quot;Not guilty&quot; 
          boldly and rather bear the punishment than be false or dishonest; the 
          other three, fearful of being convinced against their will, will carefully 
          stop their ears while the witnesses for the defence are being examined, 
          and delude themselves with the idea they give an honest verdict because 
          they have heard only one side of the evidence. If any out of the dozen 
          deserve punishment, you surely agree with me it is these. Belief or 
          disbelief is therefore not meritorious, and when founded on an unfair 
          balance of evidence is blameable.</font></p>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now to apply the principles 
          in my own case. In my early youth I heard, as ninety-nine-hundredths 
          of the world do, only the evidence on one side, and became impressed 
          with a veneration for religion which has left some traces even to this 
          day. I have since heard and read much on both sides, and pondered much 
          upon the matter in all its bearings. ...I think I have fairly heard 
          and fairly weighed the evidence on both sides, and I remain an utter 
          disbeliever in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths. 
          I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation 
          that sceptics shut out evidence because they will not be governed by 
          the morality of Christianity. You I know will not believe that in my 
          case, and I know its falsehood as a general rule. I only ask, Do you 
          think I can change the self-formed convictions of twenty-five years, 
          and could you think such a change would have anything in it to merit 
          reward from justice? I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. 
          To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether 
          there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal 
          soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no 
          fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for 
          truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who 
          have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and 
          which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.</font></p>
</blockquote>     
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sims letter is one of the most important of 
      all of Wallace's writings, public or private. Not only does it all but prove 
      that as of 1861--that is, three years <em>after</em> his formulation of 
      natural selection--Wallace was experiencing no pangs of guilt related to 
      his rejection of religious views, but it also succinctly roots his reasons 
      for such rejection in his convictions regarding the value of belief. Belief 
      had no intrinsic merit; only a continuing unbiased examination of the facts 
      pertaining to any given question resulted in values that were progress-serving. 
      Superficial or prejudging evaluations generated actions likely to be inconsistent 
      with the greater reality, and thus deserving of rejection by that reality. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Progress&quot; thus 
        occurred only as individual human beings combined a willingness to re-evaluate 
        positions with a receptivity to constructive change. Considering (as discussed 
        in the passage assigned to note 84), Wallace extended this understanding 
        to account for the way society in general &quot;progressed.&quot; His approach to 
        classification (per note 86), moreover, suggests he had concluded that 
        success within the biological world was, in like fashion, a function of 
        a well-rounded adaptation to multiple influences. In the biological context, 
        of course, the analog to such &quot;continual re-evaluation of position&quot; was 
        achieved rotely, forced by ambient ecological/environmental circumstances; 
        nonetheless, those individual organisms (or populations) that were capable 
        of responding productively to the widest range of relevant constraints 
        were the ones that generally prevailed in the struggle for existence.<sup><a href="#92">92</a></sup> 
        Thus, whether one was considering the evolution of organisms or social 
        systems, it was possible to view progress as being facilitated by actions 
        deriving from a wide-ranging experience (again, whether &quot;experience&quot; was 
        achieved deliberately, through a coupling of conscious effort and receptivity, 
        or probabilistically, in response to complex interactions of impinging 
        biological forces; for example, at the population level).<sup><a href="#93">93</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which 
        Wallace had at an early age digested the role of belief in effecting progress 
        is evidenced by his incorporation of the subject into the very first published 
        writing of his of which we know--the essay on the organization of mechanics' 
        institutions composed about 1841 (and published in 1845):</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The correction of false ideas 
          and incorrect opinions on well-known principles of science are not among 
          the least benefits that would accrue from such a course as we have recommended. 
          How many having imbibed a false opinion, and having embraced it for 
          a time, as a certain and undoubted fact, are, on seeing it contradicted 
          without a clear explanation, more apt to doubt the truth of the principle 
          they have misunderstood, than willing to acknowledge that they have 
          been so long in error. As the means of inciting to the acquirement of 
          knowledge on all subjects, of creating a wish for information on what 
          have been hitherto considered as abstruse branches of knowledge, but 
          which are frequently among the most interesting and generally useful,--and 
          of inspiring a desire for diving deeper into its inexhaustible stores 
          not yet exposed to the scrutinizing gaze of man, such an institution 
          as this, conducted in the way we have described, will be invaluable.<sup><a href="#94">94</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's youthful conclusions regarding the interrelationship 
      of justice, merit and belief are critical to understanding the directions 
      his thinking took in 1858 and afterward. Apparently, he had been cogitating 
      on such matters from a very early age; in <em>My Life</em><sup><a href="#95">95</a></sup> 
      he notes that he first came into contact with the arguments of skeptics 
      in his early teens. At that time he read Thomas Paine's <em>Age of Reason</em> 
      and the works of Robert Owen and his son Robert Dale Owen, and began considering 
      the question of the origin of evil. An especially important influence, apparently, 
      was the message of a tract called <em>Consistency</em>, penned by Robert 
      Dale Owen. Wallace found the younger Owen's criticism of the doctrine of 
      eternal punishment fully convincing, reporting that he &quot;thoroughly agreed 
      with Mr. Dale Owen's conclusion, that the orthodox religion of the day was 
      degrading and hideous, and that the only true and wholly beneficial religion 
      was that which inculcated the service of humanity, and whose only dogma 
      was the brotherhood of man.&quot;<sup><a href="#96">96</a></sup> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should come as 
        no surprise that Wallace put the &quot;no merit to uninformed belief&quot; argument 
        to direct use on a number of later occasions. Some examples follow:</p>
<blockquote>      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...we maintain that any temporary 
          influence whatever, which would induce a man to vote differently from 
          what he would have done by his own unbiassed judgment, is bad--that 
          a man has a perfect right to uphold the interests of his class, and 
          that it is, on the whole, better for the community that he should do 
          so. For, if the voter is sufficiently instructed, honest, and far-seeing, 
          he will be convinced that nothing that is disadvantageous to the community 
          as a whole can be really and permanently beneficial to his class or 
          party; while, if he is less advanced in social and political knowledge, 
          he will solve the problem the other way, and be fully satisfied that 
          in advancing the interests of his class he is also benefiting the community 
          at large. In neither case, is it at all likely, or indeed desirable, 
          that the temporary and personal influence of others' opinions at the 
          time of an election, should cause him to vote contrary to the convictions 
          he has deliberately arrived at, under the continued action of those 
          same influences, and which convictions are the full expression of his 
          political knowledge and honesty at the time?...<sup><a href="#97">97</a></sup></font></p>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...We next find the broad statement 
          that the idea of duty is not universal among men, but no evidence is 
          offered, except that no one act is held to be a duty universally, or 
          the contrary. But this is to mis-apprehend the real question, which 
          is rather, whether there is any race of men among whom nothing is considered 
          a duty. Is there any race with whom there are not certain acts which 
          the majority do, or refrain from doing, independently of any fear of 
          punishment, but because they believe them to be right or wrong? And 
          is there, on the other hand, any race of animals whose actions are influenced 
          in the same way?...<sup><a href="#98">98</a></sup></font></p>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...The belief of a future life 
          has been bound up with, and perhaps rested upon, the belief in the existence 
          and occasional appearance on earth of spiritual beings, and the spirits 
          of the dead, and of such popular phenomena as ghosts, visions, warnings, 
          premonitions, etc. Beliefs of this nature prevailed almost universally 
          up to about two centuries ago, when they came to a comparatively sudden 
          end, and have since been treated by the educated in general as fables 
          and superstitions, and this view has become so general and so ingrained 
          that many people will not allow that the question is even open to discussion 
          at all, even to admit the possibility of such phenomena as actual facts, 
          but consider it the mark of ignorance and degrading superstition. This 
          almost sudden revulsion of feeling (for it is a mere feeling, not belief 
          founded on knowledge and enquiry) may be, I think, clearly traced to 
          the current action of two powerful causes: one of them the witchcraft 
          mania of the middle ages, the other the rise of physical science...<sup><a href="#99">99</a></sup></font></p>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...They mean, as clearly as 
          words can convey meaning, that each one's work during the week, that 
          work which is the duty of our lives, and by which we maintain ourselves, 
          is to cease on the Sabbath; and that the law is especially to apply 
          to all servants of every kind, and to all beasts of burthen, which are 
          included under the generic term 'cattle.' This being the commandment, 
          how is it obeyed by those who uphold the sanctity of the law; by those 
          who are continually urging others to keep the Sabbath; by those who 
          take every opportunity of putting in force human laws against Sabbath-breakers? 
          Are not manservants and maidservants all at work on Sunday? Are not 
          servants and horses employed by the thousand to take people to church 
          on Sunday? Many persons, if asked why they go to church or chapel, will 
          say that it is to save their souls or to please God, and yet they seem 
          to think that they may break what they believe is God's own commandment 
          week after week, without any chance of displeasing Him or of losing 
          the souls they are so anxious to save. What makes the matter worse is 
          that, while they are thus disobeying the scriptural commandment in the 
          most flagrant manner, they are salving their consciences by abstaining, 
          and trying to force others to abstain, from things which are not forbidden 
          by the commandment, and which are not in any way opposed to its spirit...<sup><a href="#100">100</a></sup></font></p>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">...Religious belief would...furnish 
          an adequate incentive to morality, if it were so firmly held and fully 
          realised as to be constantly present to the mind in all its dread reality. 
          But, as a matter of fact, it produces little effect of the kind, and 
          we must impute this, not to any shadow of doubt as to the reality of 
          future rewards and punishments, but rather to the undue importance attached 
          to belief, to prayer, to church-going, and to repentance, which are 
          often held to be sufficient to ensure salvation, notwithstanding repeated 
          lapses from morality during an otherwise religious life. The existence 
          of such a possible escape from the consequences of immoral acts is quite 
          sufficient to explain why the most sincere religious belief of the ordinary 
          kind is no adequate guarantee against vice or crime under the stress 
          of temptation...<sup><a href="#101">101</a></sup></font></p>

          way</em> to teach and to civilize, whether children or savages, is through 
          the influence of love and sympathy; and the great thing to teach them 
          is to have the most absolute respect for the rights of others, and to 
          accustom them to receive pleasure from the happiness of others...I cannot 
          see that the teaching of all this can be furthered by the dogmas of 
          any religion, and I do not believe that those dogmas really have any

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1862 and his 
        return to England Wallace was a celebrity, and any concerns he may ever 
        have ever felt over the validity of his personal philosophy of life had 
        long since left him. Consider, therefore, the kind of effect spiritualist 
        philosophy most likely would have had on him at that point. First, it 
        concerned an occult subject--one, moreover, whose phenomena some were 
        trying to attribute to a mechanism with which he was personally familiar: 
        mesmerism. Each of these circumstances would have held interest for him. 
        Not only could he personally contribute to the discussion as mesmerism 
        pertained to it,<sup><a href="#104">104</a></sup> but as a habitual champion 
        of unappreciated causes, he would have enjoyed trying to right what he 
        perceived to be naive criticisms of a poorly understood subject. Second, 
        the moral teachings of spiritualism were directly relatable to phenomena 
        that appeared to be, at least in some instances, verifiable, and were 
        thus believable. Here, it seemed, was another aspect of the natural world 
        inviting detached exploration by the intelligent skeptic, and Wallace 
        was by nature both skeptical and insatiably curious. Third, the teachings 
        themselves avoided dogma, instead encouraging the individual to respond 
        as his or her personal assessment of the facts warranted. No unmeritorious 
        belief here: this was not religion--at least not of any variety depending 
        on the kind of inculcation and blind acceptance to which Wallace objected. 
        The teachings were also perfectly in line with the ideas on continuity 
        of causality Wallace had reasoned out and adopted some twenty or more 
        years earlier. In short, he recognized in spiritualism elements of a truly 
        &quot;natural&quot; philosophy: it gave a logical, testable accounting of how just 
        cause and effect are related at the level of human consciousness, moral 
        and intellectual behavior, and evolution. Spiritualism, moreover, endorsed 
        his program of &quot;balancing evidence&quot; (as so succinctly described in the 
        letter of 15 March 1861 to his brother-in-law); i.e., its proponents concurred 
        with his earlier-expressed feeling that there was to be no fear of suffering 
        &quot;for the study of nature and the search for truth.&quot; His familiarization 
        with spiritualism could only have fortified his already existing negative 
        impression of conventional theism: the less one depended on opinions served 
        up by unquestioning authority, the better.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of 
        the connections set out above alone, it is not difficult to understand 
        why Wallace adopted the belief. He recognized in the movement something 
        quite distinct from rote acceptance of unverifiable doctrines (i.e., religion), 
        investigated on this basis, and was convinced (rightly or wrongly) by 
        what he found.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later we examine 
        in some detail the final page of this story: the specific events which 
        I feel propelled Wallace into closely studying and adopting spiritualistic 
        beliefs at the time he actually did.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of Wallace's intellectual development 
        before--or after--1858 should not rest on undefendable assumptions. It 
        cannot be admitted as demonstrated (and in fact the issue is hardly ever 
        even raised) that the teachings of spiritualism are fundamentally inconsistent 
        with nature as the latter is more conventionally interpreted, and, more 
        importantly, these teachings are, in point of fact, neither anti-evolutionary 
        nor anti-&quot;progressive.&quot; In my opinion, Wallace viewed them as relaying 
        an evolutionary interpretation of reality, and as being, to a close approximation, 
        compatible with the then-developing materialistic interpretations of biological 
        evolution. Of course, if it is argued <em>a priori</em> that spiritualism 
        and evolution <em>must</em> represent mutually incompatible conceptual 
        domains, one inexorably arrives at the facile conclusion that upon accepting 
        spiritualistic beliefs Wallace must have had a change of mind regarding 
        natural selection's relation to man's higher faculties. But the fundamental 
        principles of Wallace's approach to the study of man/nature had been set 
        in his mind well before he finally stumbled onto natural selection, and 
        given the fact that he repeatedly re-affirmed his belief in those principles 
        in his writings over a span of seventy years--that is, over a period beginning 
        well before 1858--it is extremely difficult to believe that either natural 
        selection or spiritualism had any profound effect on re-directing them. 
        His relation of the two ideas is the product of his personal evolution 
        of thought, not its cause.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point we 
        turn to a re-examination of some of the other things that were on Wallace's 
        mind before 1858, and how these helped shape his formulation of natural 
        selection in that year.</p>

        have been attending meetings during this one year period but not contributing 
        any material or discussion, but this would not have been in character. 
        At the very least it can be confidently stated that for a year or so he 
        became a non-contributor. It is also very interesting 
        that in the six years following his return to England, Wallace both attended 
        and presented at each late summer annual meeting of the British Association 
        for the Advancement of Science--except the one held in 1865.</p>

      <p><a name="43" id="43"></a>43. As Pels (1995), pp. 74-75, notes, Wallace's addition 
        of &quot;Notes of Personal Evidence&quot; to &quot;The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural&quot; 
        for inclusion in <em>On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism</em> in 1875 
        was probably in part precipitated by his wish to indicate that since the 
        time of the August-September 1866 publication of the second, he had witnessed 
        spiritualistic manifestations in a private house and without the assistance 
        of paid mediums. As Pels indicates, this would have borne on readers' 
        appreciation of what constituted &quot;reliable evidence.&quot; Thus, one can infer 
        that as of that time he supported spiritualism at least to the extent 
        of recommending its study to others, but that it was only later that he 
        obtained this additional proof of its legitimacy and fully adopted it. 
        Such proof began to emerge shortly thereafter, as in November of 1866 
        Wallace began attending sittings given in his own house by a Miss Nichol, 
        a medium discovered by his sister. Some of the phenomena reported at these 
        occasions were quite extraordinary, including apports; see <a href="S126.htm">S126</a> 
        and <a href="S132.htm">S132</a>, Kottler (1974), and <a href="S118.htm">&quot;Notes 
        of Personal Evidence&quot;</a> for related matter. (On page 126 of &quot;Notes 
        of Personal Evidence, for example, he mentions how &quot;In the first 
        edition of this Essay [i.e., the 1866 version of &quot;The Scientific 
        Aspect of the Supernatural&quot;] I did not introduce any of my own observations, 
        because I had not then witnessed any such facts in a private house, and 
        without the intervention of paid mediums, as would be likely to satisfy 
        my readers.&quot;)</p>

        In late August 1868, around the time he was putting the final touches 
        on his book <em>The Malay Archipelago</em>, Wallace attended the annual 
        British Association for the Advancement of Science meetings at Norwich. 
        There he was present at the delivery of a paper by the Rev. F. O. Morris 
        entitled &quot;On the Difficulties of Darwinism,&quot; and at the end of the paper 
        he made some comments. The latter were included in the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em> 
        issue of 19 September 1868, and included the following statement: &quot;With 
        regard to the moral bearing of the question as to whether the moral and 
        intellectual faculties could be developed by natural selection, that was 
        a subject on which Mr. Darwin had not given an opinion. He (Mr. Wallace) 
        did not believe that Mr. Darwin's theory would entirely explain those 
        mental phenomena.&quot; The existence of these remarks was first reported in 
        C. Smith (2004). Some seven months later, in April 1869, the more celebrated 
        <em>Quarterly Review</em> article was published which led to Darwin's 
        &quot;I hope you haven't murdered our own child&quot; remark.</p>

        movement, Madame Helena Blavatsky, was interested in getting Wallace's 
        support for it. Blavatsky sent Wallace a copy of her most important book, 
        <em>Isis Unveiled</em>, after it was published in 1877 (<a href="S624.htm">S624</a>). 
        Wallace was appreciative and complimented her on her efforts, but never 
        showed any interest in theosophical doctrines. In 1904 he wrote a short 
        essay (<a href="S618a.htm">S618a</a>) on the subject of reincarnation 
        (one of theosophy's central ideas) in which he referred to it as a &quot;grotesque

        a lifelong interest in the question &quot;Why does suffering exist?&quot; He discusses 
        his early fascination with the problem in <a href="bib4.htm#zS729">S729</a>

        as 1910 he was still commenting on related matters: see &quot;Is Nature Cruel?,&quot; 
        Chapter 19 of <em>The World of Life</em> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS732">S732</a>). 
        Wallace considered it one of spiritualism's strongest philosophical points 
        that it offered a logical answer to this question.</p>
      <p><a name="59" id="59"></a>59. <a href="bib3.htm#zS545">S545</a>, p. 335. In addition

        some one hundred essays, lectures, reviews, notes, and letters to the 
        Editor on spiritualistic subjects.</p>
      <p><a name="60" id="60"></a>60. The epoch 
        of &quot;Modern Spiritualism&quot; began in 1848 when the young sisters Kate and 
        Margaret Fox, of Hydeville, New York, reputedly entered into communication 
        with an entity or force that was causing an intermittent commotion of 
        loud raps and knocks in their house. Mediumistic involvement followed, 
        during which a message proclaiming the dawn of a new era was &quot;received.&quot; 
        Various organizations quickly sprang up to study both the manifestations 
        being reported, and their philosophical context.</p>
      <p><a name="61" id="61"></a>61. <a href="S001.htm">S1</a>, pp. 201-204.</p>
      <p><a name="62" id="62"></a>62. Wallace closed his paper &quot;On the Physical Geography 
        of the Malay Archipelago&quot; (<a href="S078.htm">S78</a>), read to the Royal 
        Geographical Society on 8 June 1863, with the following remarks: &quot;If...[the 
        European powers do not undertake comprehensive natural history collecting 
        programs in the areas they are colonizing] ...future ages will certainly 
        look back upon us as a people so immersed in the pursuit of wealth as 
        to be blind to higher considerations. They will charge us with having 
        culpably allowed the destruction of some of these records of Creation 
        which we had it in our power to preserve; and while professing to regard 
        every living thing as the direct handiwork and best evidence of a Creator, 
        yet, with a strange inconsistency, seeing many of them perish irrecoverably 
        from the face of the earth, uncared for and unknown.&quot; These sentiments 
        are very close to those expressed in this section of &quot;Advantages...&quot;. 
        McKinney (1976) interprets this passage as possibly signifying a pre-1864 
        religious conversion on Wallace's part, but I feel it is probably better 
        to regard it as a straightforward re-statement of a philosophical position 
        he had adopted much earlier.</p>

        not generally inclined toward pure moralizing; he probably felt that such 
        inculcation had little effect on producing &quot;informed belief.&quot; Still, on 
        at least one occasion he deliberately does so, most probably in an attempt 
        to teach by example. In Volume One of <i>My Life</i>, he spends the better 
        part of a chapter describing the life and exploits of one Jack Mytton, 
        a notorious miscreant of the early nineteenth century who had been born 
        wealthy but had philandered away a fortune and died in prison.</p>

      <p><a name="76" id="76"></a>76. Wallace has 
        been cited in many sources for his period-atypical enlightened view of 
        uncivilized peoples. In view of the deplorably misleading remarks of Pannell 
        (1992), however, a few representative reminders of this generosity of 
        viewpoint are worth reproducing:</p>
<blockquote>
      
      <p>The more I see of uncivilised 
        people, the better I think of human nature on the whole, and the essential 
        differences between so-called civilised and savage man seem to disappear. 
        [from an 1855 letter reproduced in Marchant (1916; 1975 reprint ed.), 
        p. 45]
      </p>
      <p>I have lived a month with the 
        Dyaks and have been a journey about sixty miles into the interior. I have 
        been very much pleased with the Dyaks. They are a very kind, simple and 
        hospitable people, and I do not wonder at the great interest Sir J. Brooke 
        takes in them. [from an 1855 letter reproduced in Marchant (1916; 1975 
        reprint ed.), p. 48]
      </p>
        <p>...after dusk, the house was crowded with young men and boys... They 
          were mostly fine young fellows, and I could not help admiring the simplicity 
          and elegance of their costume... The costume of the Dyaks on ordinary 
          occasions, though scanty, is highly becoming, but when they attempt 
          to make themselves extremely fine on state occasions, they only succeed 
          in becoming ridiculous. <em>In civilized countries it is the same...</em> 
          [Wallace's italics] The moral character of the Dyaks is undoubtedly 
          high. They are truthful and honest to a remarkable degree...above most 
          uncivilized, and perhaps also above most civilized, nations. (<a href="S029.htm">S29</a>, 
          pp. 195, 197, 204-205) </p>
      <p>[in reference to the natives of 
        the Aru Islands] Here, as among the Dyaks of Borneo and the Indians of 
        the Upper Amazon I am delighted with the beauty of the human form, a beauty 
        of which stay at home civilized people can never have any conception. 
        What are the finest grecian statues to the living moving breathing forms 
        which everywhere surround me... [from Wallace's Field Journal, quoted 
        in Brooks (1984), p. 170]
      </p>
        <p>It is clear, therefore, that a low state of material civilisation is 
          no indication whatever of inferiority of character... we find that the 
          supposed great mental inferiority of savages is equally unfounded. The 
          more they are sympathetically studied, the more they are found to resemble 
          ourselves in their inherent intellectual powers. Even the so-long-despised 
          Australians--almost the lowest in material progress--yet show by their 
          complex language, their elaborate social regulations, and often by an 
          innate nobility of character, indications of a very similar inner nature 
          to our own... we find in the higher Pacific types, men who, though savages 
          as regards material progress, are yet generally admitted to be--physically, 
          intellectually, and morally--our equals, if not our superiors. (<a href="S649.htm">S649</a>,

      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Chapter Six of <em>Social Environment 
      and Moral Progress</em>, one of Wallace's very last works, is entitled &quot;Savages 
      Not Morally Inferior to Civilized Races.&quot; At one point in this discussion 
      he states &quot;Many other illustrations of both intelligence and morality are 
      met with among the savage races of the world; and these, taken as a whole, 
      show a substantial identity of human character, both moral and emotional, 
      with no marked superiority in any race or country&quot; (<a href="bib4.htm#zS733">S733</a>, 
      p. 43). It would appear therefore that he had not changed his mind on this 
      matter even by this late date.</font>

        practically glow with the idea that the best efforts tend to produce the 
        most rewarding discoveries. The same concepts are also evident in the 
        following excerpt from the 1870 letter to Nature entitled &quot;Government 
        Aid to Science&quot; (<a href="S158.htm">S158</a>, p. 315):</p>
<blockquote>
        <p>The only logical foundation for 
          advocating the furtherance of scientific discovery by the expenditure 
          of public money, would be the belief that science can be most successfully 
          pursued by those whose chief object is to make practical and valuable 
          discoveries; whereas the whole history of the progress of science seems 
          to me to show that the exact opposite is the case, and that it is only 
          those who in a noble spirit of self-sacrifice give up their time, their 
          means, even their lives, in the eager and loving search after the hidden 
          secrets of Nature, who are rewarded by those great discoveries from 
          which spring a rich harvest of useful applications.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><a name="84" id="84"></a>84. <a href="S082.htm">S82</a>, p. 206. This paper, 
        &quot;On the Varieties of Man in the Malay Archipelago,&quot; was first presented 
        publicly in September 1863 at the annual meeting of the British Association 
        for the Advancement of Science. In it Wallace expands on his views regarding 
        how individual persons &quot;progress&quot; (i.e., as the function of a many-directioned 
        learning process) to a parallel prescription for success at the societal 
        level. This theme is present, explicitly and/or implicitly, in many other 
        of his writings, and throughout his career, e.g.: <a href="S065.htm">S65</a> 
        (1862), <a href="S150152.htm">S152</a> (1869), <a href="bib2.htm#zS257">S257</a> 
        (1876), and <a href="S445.htm">S445</a> (1892). One suspects that his 
        conclusions on this score were among his earliest intellectual achievements, 
        emerging at the same time as his thoughts on the &quot;advantages of varied 
        knowledge.&quot; From his essay on &quot;The South-Wales Farmer,&quot; written in 1843 
        but remaining unpublished until appearing on pp. 206-222 of Vol. 1 of 
        <em>My Life</em> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS729">S729</a>), the following passage 
        might be noted in this regard: </p>
<blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[The South-Wales farmers'] system 
        of farming is as poor as the land they cultivate. In it we see all the 
        results of carelessness, prejudice, and complete ignorance. We see the 
        principle of doing as well as those who went before them, and no better, 
        in full operation; the good old system which teaches us not to suppose 
        ourselves capable of improving on the wisdom of our forefathers, and which 
        has made the early polished nations of the East so inferior in every respect 
        to us, whose reclamation from barbarism is ephemeral compared with their 
        long period of almost stationary civilization. The Welshman, when you 
        recommend any improvement in his operations, will tell you, like the Chinaman, 
        that it is an &quot;old custom,&quot; and that what did for his forefathers is good 
        enough for him. (p. 207)</font>

      <p><a name="86" id="86"></a>86. Wallace favored basing classification on multiple 
        character traits. In fact, as we shall see later, he was not averse to 
        applying even behavioral characters to classification efforts in an effort 
        to draw into consideration as many pertinent criteria as possible. For 
        two other discussions featuring his support of multiple character-based 
        classification, see <a href="S077.htm">S77</a> and <a href="S088.htm">S88</a>.</p>

        of re-evaluation&quot; implies that there is a degree of environmental control 
        over the nature of organic change, but this understanding does not demand 
        outright determinism. See C. Smith (1986) for related discussion.</p>

        ii, p. 272) Wallace writes: &quot;Equality of opportunity is, as Herbert Spencer 
        has shown in his <em>Justice</em>, the correlative of natural selection 
        in human society, and thus has a broad foundation in the laws of nature.&quot;</p>

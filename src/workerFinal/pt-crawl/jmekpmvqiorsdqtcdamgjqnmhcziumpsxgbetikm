        History<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Kingsnakes 
        and milksnakes are some of the most beautiful snakes in the world and 
        are very popular and easily kept in captivity. Moderately sized and usually 
        quite docile, these snakes appeal to the beginner as well as to the experienced 
        herpetoculturist. The scientific name for the genus of kingsnakes and 
        milksnakes is <i>Lampropeltis</i>. <i>Lampro</i> is derived from the Greek 
        word for &quot;shiny&quot; and <i>peltis</i>, Greek for &quot;shields.&quot; 
        The name is a very accurate descriptor of these snakes with their glossy, 
        smooth, well-defined scales. <i>Lampropeltis</i> <i>getula</i> (kingsnakes), 
        <i>L. triangulum</i> (milksnakes) and the other six species (comprising 
        forty-five subspecies) can be found throughout most of the United States, 
        the southern parts of Ontario and Quebec, down through Central America 
        and parts of South America. Kings can be found in arid deserts, swamplands, 
        farmlands, grasslands, pine and deciduous forests, up to 8,500 feet in 
        the Rockies and to 10,000 in the Andes, and in riparian habitats. These 
        constrictors, in the wild they consume a variety of prey, including other 
        snakes, amphibians, lizards, rodents, birds, even rattlesnakes.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">One of 
        the most interesting thing about some of the kings and milks, and something 
        which unfortunately works only too well, is their mimicry of the venomous 
        coral snakes. As most people cannot tell the difference and many believe 
        that all snakes are uniformly dangerous, wild kings and milks are often 
        met with the business end of a shovel rather than the respect they deserve 
        for their efforts in keeping the rodent populations in check. To set the 
        record straight, <i>Lampropeltis</i> and coral snakes can easily be told 
        apart by the order of the color of their bands. Both snakes have yellow, 
        red and black bands. Kings and milks have black bands touching the red 
        bands; in corals, the yellow touches the red bands. A simple rhyme makes 
        it easy to remember the order: Red on yellow, kill a fellow. An alternative 
        rhyme, yellow on red, you're dead&quot; is a bit of an overstatement, 
        as the vast majority of people who do get bitten by a coral snake just 
        become very ill, recovering with no residual effects.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">As <i>Lampropeltis</i> 
        are easily bred in captivity, there is never a reason to purchase a wild 
        one. In California and now, in Arizona, there are stringent laws concerning 
        the wild collection and the sale of captive bred kingsnakes about which 
        many pet stores are unfamiliar. Captive breeding has produced numerous 
        color and pattern morphs, ranging from different types of albinos to striped 
        and mottled markings. Some of the most striking, however, are the most 
        natural - vivid bands of colors, or the simple black and brilliant yellows 
        of the Florida and Sonoran kings.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Kings 
        and milks are oviparous, laying fifteen or so eggs. Hatchlings emerge 
        from the eggs anywhere from six to ten weeks after being laid, and range 
        in size from eight to thirteen inches long. Adults range in size from 
        three feet up to seven feet, depending upon the species. With proper care, 
        kings will live 20 or more years.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Selecting 
        Your Kingsnake or Milksnake<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">What subspecies 
        you select is a personal decision, but the criteria by which you evaluate 
        the potential purchase remains the same. The snake should have a firm 
        rounded body. Check the sides for any caving, sign of possible broken 
        ribs (which happens primarily to wild-caught snakes). The eyes should 
        be clear with no sign of secretions, cloudiness (other than routine opaquing 
        before shedding) nor any signs of mites; mites may also be detected by 
        their feces, a grayish-white &quot;dust&quot; speckling the snake's body. 
        There should be no gaping--open mouth breathing or catching of breath--which 
        is indicative of a respiratory or parasitical infection. The skin should 
        be shiny with no sign of sores, scabs or discolored patches. The ventral 
        surface (the belly side) should look as good as the top surface. The vent 
        (cloaca) should be clean, free or any feces or urates. There should be 
        no swelling either above the vent or towards the tail. The inside of the 
        mouth should be uniformly pink. Any red spots may be a sign of beginning 
        mouthrot; any yellow, cheesy substance is a sign of advanced mouthrot. 
        There should be no excess mucous, and the tongue sheath should be clean 
        and whole.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Unless 
        a snake has been handled a lot by a number of different people, it will 
        not be particularly tame when you first pick it up or when it is first 
        handed to you. The snake should move purposefully and persistently; let 
        it move from hand to hand. A wild or highly stressed snake is going to 
        wave the upper half of its body in the air trying to escape as soon as 
        it is free of your hands. When the snake is comfortable with you, it will 
        spend some time wrapped around your hand or arm, actively interested in 
        its surroundings as evidenced by tongue flicking and alert to movement. 
        When you first hold the snake, feel along its entire length to see if 
        you can feel any bumps, lumps or unusually hard or soft areas. When you 
        put the snake down, check your hands to see if there are any mites. Look 
        at the snake move to see that it is moving smoothly, with no abrupt hitches 
        in gait or tremors.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Housing 
        your snake<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Kings and 
        milks are escape artists. If there is any small (very small) gap or hole, 
        or any &quot;give&quot; to the fitting of the top attached to their tank 
        or between the doors and casement, your snake will escape. Kings, more 
        than any other snake, is known for its tenacity it testing it's environment, 
        looking for a way out. Once out, they are very difficult to find. For 
        this reason, the selection and purchase of a commercial enclosure (or 
        design of a custom enclosure) is just as important as your personal selection 
        of a snake. A tight enclosure is more expensive, whether you buy one or 
        make it yourself, but this is an expense that you cannot skimp on. What 
        is the point of saving some money on an inferior enclosure if, in the 
        end, you lose your snake? Doing it right the first time will save you 
        from some grief down the line.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Enclosure<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The enclosure 
        you select must have a tightly fitting, locking, top. Available commercially 
        are a variety of glass enclosures with tops consisting of screen mesh 
        and a hinged glass door which locks into place with a small swing latch. 
        Available now are also locking screen tops which can be put on previously 
        purchased tanks. With either of these enclosures, check the give of the 
        tops before you place your snake inside and walk away. Snakes are, for 
        the lack of a better word, squishy, and can squeeze themselves through 
        impossibly tight spaces. Any gaps due to &quot;give&quot; in the doors 
        or tops can be reduced significantly by fitting aquarium airline tubing 
        all around the opening.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hatchlings 
        may be housed in a ten gallon enclosures. Medium sized adults may be housed 
        in twenty gallon enclosures, but you might as well get hatchlings and 
        young adults set up in a tank large enough for a full grown one. The longer 
        and larger snakes should be housed in a 60 gallon enclosure. Try to get 
        high-sided enclosures so that you may put in some vertical climbing and 
        above-the-floor basking areas. Milk and king snakes, like all the other 
        snakes in the family Colubridae (typically, non-venomous snakes considered 
        to be more highly evolved than the boas and pythons), have only one functioning 
        lung. Due to the lack of space inside the confines of their rib cage, 
        all organs are elongated and so there is now room for only one working 
        lung. Their left lung is still there, withered to a vestigial stub. Because 
        of this somewhat reduced lung capacity, and the fact that when such snakes 
        cannot stretch fully out on a regular basis, they are prone to respiratory 
        infections. For this reason, it is important to give the snake as much 
        stretching room as possible.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Heat<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Lampropeltis</i> 
        that live in climates that experience extremes in heat and cold alter 
        their daily habits to accommodate such extremes. Hibernating through the 
        cold winters, northern and mountain snakes spend the season dormant. Desert 
        species will hide in cool crevices during the hottest part of the day, 
        becoming crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk). In captivity, the extremes 
        do not need to be provided unless you are trying to breed your snakes. 
        In general, provide a temperature gradient ranging from 76-86 F, with 
        nighttime drops into the low 70's. If you are providing an enclosure with 
        high enough sides to establish basking and hiding areas at different levels 
        within the enclosure, you will need to make sure that gradient is both 
        horizontal as well as vertical. Do not try to guess the temperature. You 
        must use thermometers. Ideally, one should be placed in the cool end, 
        the warm end, and at any other area where the snake spends much of its 
        time. The hottest areas should not exceed the maximum stated range by 
        more than a couple of degrees, especially for snakes from temperate areas.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Heating 
        pads (either people heating pads or ones developed for reptiles) can be 
        placed under half the tank, or inside the tank, under half the substrate 
        (depending on the heat source and the substrate - do not put pads of any 
        type in contact with any substrate made with paper or shavings products).. 
        Under no circumstances is a <a href="hotrock.html">hot rock</a> to be 
        used as is or as the sole source of heat. If you want to use one for a 
        species who basks on hot rocky surfaces in the wild, keeping in mind that 
        desert species stay out of the direct sun during the heat of the day, 
        then it must be connected to a thermostat so that you can control the 
        temperature and check it often. These &quot;rocks&quot; heat up to 105+ 
        F on the surface, too hot for the majority of reptiles, and capable of 
        causing severe burns. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Bright 
        white Incandescent and other heat lights are impractical as the sole source 
        of heat for two reasons: they must be turned off a night, thus allowing 
        too great a drop in temperature, and they bother the snakes, especially 
        the nocturnal ones. With a large enough enclosure, you can use a white 
        light heat source for daytime, and a radiant heat source, such as a ceramic 
        heating element (CHE) or nocturnal reptile bulb, for night. Radiant heat 
        from below can be supplemented with a non-light emitting heat source such 
        as a CHE. If the ambient room air temperature is always warm (in the low 
        to mid part of the gradient required), then you may be able to make do 
        with only one heat source, at least during part of the year..</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Humidity 
        and Water</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Provide a bowl of water 
        for your snake. This is generally all the humidity they will need. They 
        will often soak in the water, especially prior to a shed. As they often 
        defecate in the water, you much check it daily, cleaning and disinfecting 
        it before placing it back in the tank. One of the problems experienced 
        years ago by herpetoculturists and hobbyists keeping <i>Lampropeltis</i> 
        is that the substrate was kept too damp, causing bacterial, fungal and 
        respiratory infections. Make sure that the substrate remains dry at all 
        times.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Note: 
        some books and herp keepers recommend just putting in a bowl of water 
        once a week for a limited period of time. Until such time as you learn 
        to speak <i>Lampropeltis</i>, or your snake learns to vocalize its needs, 
        or you both communicate by telepathy so that you will know when exactly 
        it is thirsty, keep water in there all the time.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Furnishings<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Kings and 
        milks are rather secretive snakes, preferring to curl up in a rocky crevice 
        or under a log. Shelters of some sort should be provided in both the cool 
        and in the warm ends of the enclosure. They can range from commercially 
        available &quot;rocky&quot; caves, half-circles of tree bark, and upside-down 
        flower pots. Less aesthetically pleasing is the &quot;green&quot; approach--recycle 
        facial tissue and other suitably sized boxes into caves. They are easily 
        disposed of and replaced when they get soiled.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Enclosures 
        may range from the strictly utilitarian (substrate, caves, water bowl) 
        to being a vivarium, outfitted with substrate similar to that found in 
        the snake's native habitat, rocks, branches, backdrops, etc. It is easier 
        to start of utilitarian, and then design and plan the interior design 
        once you see your snake in place and it has acclimated to captivity.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Substrate<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Until you 
        are certain that your new acquisition has no worms, protozoan infections 
        or mites, start it off on paper towels or butcher paper. Easily changed 
        when soiled, these materials will also enable you to monitor the condition 
        of the feces and to detect the presence of mites.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Once you 
        are sure your snake is parasite-free and healthy, you can continue using 
        these papers, or use one of the following substrates, chosen based on 
        what your type of habitat your king is native to: untinted aspen shavings 
        (cedar and redwood are toxic, and there is some feeling that their relative, 
        the pine, may be toxic as well); Astroturf or outdoor carpeting; number 
        three aquarium gravel (not silica) and clean playground sand, washed and 
        dried before use; mixture of sterile potting soil and sand and/or orchid 
        bark shreds. This latter substrate is what caused early king-keepers such 
        problems--the surface of this type of substrate was too often damp. When 
        using this soil mix, the top several inches should be very dry. Desert 
        vivaria can be outfitted with a clean playground sand.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The real 
        key to substrates is what is appropriate for your species of king or milk, 
        how difficult they are to clean and change, and how likely you are to 
        do what is necessary as often as it is necessary. The more difficult or 
        complicated you make the inside of the enclosure to clean, the less likely 
        a busy person is going to do it. Find that delicate balance between providing 
        as much interest and variety for your snake and what you can reasonably 
        expect to be able to do on an at least weekly basis.</font></p>

        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Captive born 
        hatchlings are started off on pink mice, and so feeding them is rarely 
        a problem. Wild caught snakes, on the other hand, may have been feeding 
        primarily on lizards or frogs, making it quite a bit more difficult and 
        time consuming to get them switched over to mice. If you are having feeding 
        problems, read the articles on <a href="hatchlin.html">Feeding Troublesome 
        Hatchlings</a> and <a href="feedingtips.html">Feeding Tips for Carnivorous 
        Reptiles</a>. All kings and milks should be fed <a href="prekill.html">prekilled 
        prey</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Hatchlings 
        can be started on one-two day old pinkie mice. If frozen mice are used, 
        make sure to defrost thoroughly (leave on counter, under a light, or soaking 
        in warm water). Feed one to two mice every two to seven days, depending 
        upon growth rate desired. Generally speaking, a snake will grow faster 
        being fed several small prey a couple of times a week rather than one 
        big prey once a week. The smaller prey are more digestible than the larger 
        prey, so the snake is getting more nutrition from them.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Subadults 
        can be offered bigger mice one or more times a week. A good rule of thumb 
        is to feed prey that is as big girth-wise as is the widest part of the 
        snake's body. You will find that they are hungrier in the spring and summer, 
        winding down during the fall; many stop feeding altogether during the 
        winter months even though the may still be somewhat active.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Adult 
        size is generally reached within three years at which time the amount 
        and rate of feeding can be reduced. Feed adult mice or just weaned pink 
        rats. At this point, judgment must come into play. You want your snake 
        to be well rounded, with no visible line of backbone or ribs. The amount 
        of food it takes to maintain that weight and appearance varies between 
        species. Start with once a week; if the snake looks too lean, increase 
        to one mouse twice a week. Another rule of thumb: snakes over four feet 
        long need at least two adult mice each week.</font></p>

        collect the feces in a clean plastic bag, seal it, label it with the date,

        your snake a couple of days to settle in, begin picking it up and handling 
        it gently. It may move from you and it may anoint you with a smelly musky 
        substance from it's vent. Be gentle but persistent. Daily contact will 
        begin to establish a level of trust and confidence between you and your 
        snake. When it is comfortable with you, you can begin taking it around 
        the house. Don't get overconfident! Given a chance and close proximity 
        to seat cushions, your snake will make a run (well, a slither) for it, 
        easing down between the cushions and from there, to points possibly unknown. 
        Always be gentle, and try to avoid sudden movements. If the snake wraps 
        around your arm or neck, you can unwind it by gently grasping it by the 
        tail and unwrapping it from around you. If you start at the head, you 
        will find that your snake is stronger than you are, or at least, more 
        tenacious.</font></p>

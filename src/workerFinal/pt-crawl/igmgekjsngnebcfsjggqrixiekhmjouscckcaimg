/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 462]] </font>Since 
        the first volume of &quot;The Principles of Geology&quot; appeared--now more than 
        forty-three years ago--Sir Charles Lyell has put forth an uninterrupted 
        series of new works or new editions, and we have now arrived at the 11th 
        edition of the &quot;Principles,&quot; the 7th of the &quot;Elements of Geology,&quot; and 
        the 4th of the &quot;Antiquity of Man.&quot; A most striking feature of these works 
        is, that they give the fullest and most accurate scientific details, and 
        the most philosophical discussion of principles and results, without for 
        a single page ceasing to be interesting to any well educated and thoughtful 
        man. Perhaps no author has attained in so perfect a degree the art of 
        making science popular without ever attempting to popularise it, or has 
        produced a series of works which are equally acceptable to the experienced 
        geologist and to the general reader.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present edition of the well-known &quot;Antiquity 
        of Man&quot; will fully sustain the author's high reputation, since it is not 
        a mere corrected reprint of former editions, but, in several important 
        respects, a new work, embodying all the most recent discoveries and researches 
        on the various subjects of which it treats, while several discussions 
        of temporary or personal interest have been omitted. Almost every chapter 
        contains either important new facts or new results derived from a more 
        careful study of old ones; while some are almost wholly rewritten, as, 
        for example, chap. xii., in which the most recent researches on the climate 
        of the Crag period is very fully given; and it would need a very acute 
        critic to discover in these any lack of that lucidity of arrangement and 
        vigour of thought which have always distinguished Sir Charles Lyell's 
        writings.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking additional facts bearing directly 
        on the Antiquity of Man are so well known and have been so often before 
        the public, that it is unnecessary to enumerate them here; but it may 
        be advisable to remark briefly upon a theoretical point of some importance 
        on which the author's views seem open to question; and there are also 
        a few matters connected with the general subject which seem worthy of 
        attention.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Professor Gastaldi, of Turin, after 
        a careful study of the Italian Alps, has adopted Professor Ramsay's view 
        of the excavation of alpine lake basins by ice, Sir Charles Lyell is still 
        strongly opposed to that view. He maintains that they have been produced 
        by changes of level in valleys, producing depressions which have been 
        preserved during the glacial epoch by being filled with ice, while at 
        all other times they were either soon filled by <em>d&eacute;bris</em>, 
        or their lower barriers were cut down as fast as they were formed. He 
        thus accounts for the fact that lakes only occur in any abundance in glaciated 
        districts. He further maintains that the erosive power of glaciers, as 
        indicated by the muddy torrent that always issues from them has been overrated, 
        because &quot;the flour of rock&quot; thus produced is due, not solely to the wearing 
        down of the floor of the valley, but, &quot;to a considerable extent,&quot; to the 
        grinding up of the stones which fall upon the glacier and are engulphed 
        in its crevasses.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are doubtless many difficulties in Prof. 
        Ramsay's theory, and much remains to be done to verify it, but it does 
        seem to cover a larger portion of the facts than that now opposed to it. 
        There is no evidence before us to show how much of the glacier mud is 
        respectively due to the two sources above referred to, but the enormous 
        bulk of many of the old moraines, where they have not been destroyed by 
        subsequent denudation, seems amply sufficient to account for the <em>d&eacute;bris</em> 
        which falls upon a glacier; while the wide extent of glaciated surfaces, 
        and the manner in which the very hardest upturned strata are often planed 
        off or <em>moutonn&eacute;es</em>, is equally convincing proof that large 
        masses of rock have been ground down by glaciers. The evidence of this 
        is very remarkable also, in the case of the Loess, a deposit which covers 
        an enormous extent of country, and in some parts of the valley of the 
        Rhine reaches a thickness of near 1,000 feet, and which Sir Charles Lyell 
        himself considers to be undoubtedly glacial mud. It is difficult to conceive 
        how such an enormous amount of mud could have been formed except by a 
        grinding power capable of producing most of the effects imputed to it 
        by Prof. Ramsay. It is considered to be one of the most powerful arguments 
        against the ice-erosion theory that no lakes exist in certain valleys 
        which were undoubtedly filled with enormous glaciers; but the answer to 
        this is, that a lake will only be produced when the erosion is considerably 
        greater at one part of the valley than at another, and this inequality 
        may be caused either by unequal hardness of the subjacent rocks or by 
        the piling up of the ice to a greater thickness in certain spots by the 
        convergence of several branch glaciers, as must have been notably the 
        case over the site of Lago Maggiore, which received the icy streams descending 
        from near 100 miles of the loftiest Alps. It must also be remembered, 
        that at such points of convergence the rate of motion of the glacier will 
        be much more rapid than elsewhere, in order to discharge the accumulated 
        ice-streams; and we shall thus have a double cause of increased grinding 
        in such positions. A difficulty of a somewhat similar nature, and which 
        cannot be so easily overcome, besets the unequal-subsidence theory, which 
        can hardly be made to account for the thousands and tens of thousands 
        of lakes so thickly scattered over the lowlands of Northern Europe and 
        America.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is somewhat remarkable that notwithstanding 
        the numerous researches in post-tertiary caves and gravels in all parts 
        of Europe, no human remains have been discovered which can be proved to 
        be older than those found by Dr. Schmerling more than forty years ago 
        in the caverns near Li&eacute;ge. After many years' labour this gentleman, 
        a skilful anatomist and pal&aelig;ontologist, published, in 1833, a detailed 
        account of his researches, copiously illustrated. It is curious to see, 
        from Sir Charles Lyell's account of this work, how completely its author 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 463]]</font> anticipated all the more important 
        results of modern cave exploration, and how thoroughly he had worked out 
        that doctrine of the antiquity of man which the great majority of geologists 
        so long attempted to put down. Such wholly independent researches as those 
        of Schmerling in Belgium, McEnery in Devonshire, and Boucher de Perthes 
        in France, made by careful and conscientious observers, and all converging 
        to the demonstration of one fact, were for many long years laughed at 
        or ignored, solely because they clashed with preconceived opinions. When 
        this occurred with the students of a science which had already fought 
        and won many hard battles against popular and theological prejudice, and 
        whose whole course of study should have taught them how to interpret the 
        evidence adduced, we are bound to deal tenderly with the less unjustifiable 
        prejudices of those who have had no such training.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the lesson these long-ignored 
        facts should have taught them, some geologists still exhibit a strange 
        fear or hesitation in facing the whole results of modern inquiries on 
        the subject. How is it that, whenever any estimate is made of the lapse 
        of time (expressed in years) since any human remains or works of art were 
        deposited, the lowest possible estimate is almost always chosen? One would 
        think that, having once got beyond the traditional six thousand years, 
        the period of man's past existence would be a matter of purely scientific 
        inquiry, to be arrived at by careful estimates in a variety of ways. But 
        how can we possibly arrive at the truth by always taking the lowest estimate? 
        we might just as reasonably always take the highest. Is there any merit 
        in arriving at a false result so that the figures are small? Is it really 
        the &quot;safe&quot; side so to calculate that we shall almost certainly be wrong? 
        Astronomers do not think those observations most likely to be correct 
        which give the smallest distances and sizes of the heavenly bodies and 
        it would be more dignified and more scientific if geologists, whenever 
        any data exist on which to found a calculation, should insist on taking 
        the mean result of various impartial estimates as that most likely to 
        be the true one. From this point of view it may be interesting to give 
        a summary of the more important attempts which have yet been made to determine 
        the antiquity of human remains or works of art.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From observations at the delta of the Tini&egrave;re 
        and on the lakes of Neufchatel and Bienne, the bronze age in Europe has 
        been determined with approximate accuracy to have been from 3,000 to 4,000 
        years ago, and the stone age of the Swiss Lake dwellings at from 5,000 
        to 7,000 years and an indefinite anterior period. The burnt brick found 
        60 ft. deep in the Nile alluvium indicates an antiquity of about 20,000 
        years, taking, from a calculation by Mr. Horner, the estimate of 3 &#189; in. 
        per century as the rate of deposit of the mud. Another fragment found 
        at 72 ft. deep is estimated by M. Rosi&egrave;re to be 30,000 years old. 
        Some human bones found in a lacustrine formation in Florida have been 
        considered by Agassiz, after a careful examination of the locality, to 
        be at least 10,000 years old. A human skeleton found at a depth of 16 
        ft. below four buried forests superposed upon each other, has been calculated 
        by Dr. Dowler to have an antiquity of 50,000 years.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These latter estimates may be very uncertain, 
        but we have no reason to think them improbable, from what we know of the 
        great changes of physical geography that have undoubtedly taken place 
        since man existed. Kent's Cavern at Torquay furnishes a good example of 
        these, since the whole drainage of the surrounding country must have been 
        very different when the great thickness of cave earth was deposited by 
        floods rushing through the cavern which is now situated in an isolated 
        hill. We have here indications of an immense antiquity from various sources. 
        The upper stalagmitic floor itself marks a vast lapse of time, since it 
        divides the relics of the last two or three thousand years from a deposit 
        full of the bones of extinct mammalia, many of which, like the reindeer, 
        mammoth, and glutton, indicate an arctic climate. It has been remarked 
        that the varying thicknesses of the stalagmitic floor, from 16 in. to 
        5 ft. and upwards, closely correspond to the present amount of drip in 
        various parts of the cave, so that the cave itself with its various fissures 
        and crevices does not appear to have been materially altered since the 
        stalagmite was deposited. It is true that the drip may once have been 
        greater, but it may also have been less, and we do not know that a more 
        copious drip would necessarily produce a more rapid deposit of stalagmite. 
        But names cut into this stalagmite more than two centuries ago are still 
        legible, showing that, in a spot where the drip is now very copious, and 
        where the stalagmite is 12 ft. thick, not more than about one-eighth of 
        an inch, or say one-hundredth of a foot, has been deposited in that length 
        of time (British Association Report, 1869, p. 196). This gives a foot 
        in 20,000 years, or 5 ft. in 100,000 years; and there is no reason whatever 
        to consider this to be too high an estimate to account for the triple 
        change of organic remains, of climate, and of physical geography. But 
        below this again there is another and much older layer of stalagmite, 
        generally broken up and imbedded in the cave earth. This older stalagmite 
        is very thick and is much more crystalline than the upper one, so that 
        it was probably formed at a slower rate. Yet below this again, in a solid 
        breccia, very different from the cave earth, undoubted works of art have 
        been found. A fair estimate will therefore give us, say, 100,000 years 
        for the upper stalagmite, and about 250,000 for the deeper layer of much 
        greater thickness, and of more crystalline texture. But between these 
        we have a deposit of cave-earth which implies a different set of physical 
        conditions and an alteration in the geography of the surrounding country. 
        We have no means of measuring the period during which this continued to 
        be formed, but it was probably very great; and there was certainly some 
        great change in physical conditions during the deposit of the lower stalagmite, 
        because the fauna of the county underwent a striking change in the interval. 
        If we add 150,000 years for this period, we arrive at the sum of half 
        a million as representing the years that have probably elapsed since flints 
        of human workmanship were buried in the lowest deposits of Kent's Cavern. 
        It may be objected that such an estimate is so loose and untrustworthy 
        as to be altogether valueless; but it may be maintained, on the other 
        hand, that such estimates, if sufficiently multiplied, are of great value, 
        since they help us to form a definite idea of what kind of periods we 
        are dealing with, and furnish us with a series of hypotheses to be corrected 
        or supported by <font color="#990000">[[p. 464]]</font> further observation, 
        and will at last enable us to arrive at the antiquity of man within certain 
        probable limits of error. Without laying stress on any portion of the 
        above very rude estimate, it may, I think, be averred that it is not palpably 
        too high, but is just as likely to be too low; and this last supposition 
        will be rendered more probable when we consider the vast lapse of time 
        implied by the position of some of the recently discovered pal&aelig;olithic 
        weapons.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flint tools found in the gravel at Bournemouth, 
        in the Isle of Wight, and near Salisbury, at elevations of from 80 to 
        100 feet above the present valleys, imply, according to the best observers, 
        that the whole series of surrounding river valleys have been excavated 
        since they were deposited, and that the system of drainage and position 
        of the coast-line have been very greatly altered. The hippopotamus of 
        the Gower Caves implies changes equally great, since the peninsula of 
        Gower now contains only small streams, and could not possibly have had 
        a large river without very important changes in its relations to the adjacent 
        country. The position of the flint weapons in the valley of the Somme, 
        at Hoxne in Suffolk, and in many other places, all combine in indicating 
        that very important changes in physical geography have taken place since 
        they were deposited. We can hardly suppose that in all these different 
        localities the changes were abnormally rapid, especially as in no case 
        do records of the historic period indicate that any remnant of the process 
        was then going on; and from what we do know of the rate of such changes, 
        and their intermittent nature, we are entitled to affirm that the most 
        extreme estimates yet made of the antiquity of the men who fashioned and 
        used the pal&aelig;olithic implements is quite as likely to be under as 
        over the truth.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is as yet no clear evidence that man lived 
        in Northern Europe before the glacial epoch, and even if he did so the 
        action of the ice sheet would probably have obliterated all records of 
        his existence. Every evolutionist, however, now believes that he must 
        have existed far back in the tertiary period, and that the proof of it 
        will be found, if at all, in some of the warmer regions of the old world. 
        Here is surely a problem of grand and absorbing interest awaiting solution 
        at our hands. Geologists are not usually wanting in energy or enterprise, 
        and they number in their ranks many wealthy men. It is to be hoped that 
        they will soon energetically attack the problem; and no more promising 
        field of research offers itself than the limestone caves of Borneo, which 
        can be explored with perfect safety, and at a moderate expense. We can 
        hardly now expect any great additions to our knowledge respecting the 
        antiquity of man in Northern and Central Europe, and must go to warmer 
        regions if we wish for new discoveries and startling revelations.</p>

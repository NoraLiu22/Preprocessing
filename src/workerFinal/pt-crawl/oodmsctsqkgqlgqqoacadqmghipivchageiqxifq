                <h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>

                <p>
                    Abc notation is a simple but powerful ASCII
                    musical notation format. Devised by Chris Walshaw, abc is widely
                    used for the notating and distribution of tunes, particularly on
                    the internet. Very popular in traditional music circles, it is
                    also gaining in popularity in early music.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A tune notated in abc can be played
                    directly from the notation, or many software packages exist which
                    can convert abc notation into MIDI, produce sheet music, play the
                    file through the computer speaker, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Abc is not reliant on the user even having
                    a computer, or on a computer having any specific music hardware
                    and software. It is platform and OS independent, and is a very
                    efficient way of storing and distributing tunes and collections
                    of tunes. John Adams of the
                    <a href="http://www.village-music-project.org.uk/" target="new">Village Music Project</a>, at the end of
                    a talk at Sidmouth Festival in 1999, distributed over 1000 tunes
                    on a single floppy disk.

                <p>
                    This tutorial does not claim to be
                    authoritative or even complete in its coverage of the abc
                    standard. It is intended to be an introduction (albeit a reasonably comprehensive one),
                    and sufficiently detailed to enable you to read and write abc files.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I would of course be extremely indebted to
                    anyone who points out any errors of fact or interpretation in
                    this tutorial.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The tutorial assumes you possess basic
                    knowledge of how 'standard' Western musical notation works in
                    terms of note names and lengths, the concept of a tune having a
                    key, etc.
                </p>

                    software packages available, and links to other abc sites and

                <h3><a name="notes"></a>The Notes</h3>

                <p>
                    Middle C is notated as <br>
                    C<br>

                    The D immediately above middle C is notated as <br>
                    D<br>
                    The E above that is notated as <br>
                    E<br>
                    And so on up the scale.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Starting at middle C, the notes in that
                    octave are shown as
                </p>

                <p>CDEFGAB</p>

                <p>
                    The next note up is a C again &#150; but to
                    show it is in the higher octave, that C is shown in lowercase as <br>
                    c<br>
                    So a full one-octave C major scale from middle C is
                </p>

                <p>CDEFGABc</p>

                <p>
                    So going from middle C to the B one octave
                    and seven notes above that is
                </p>

                <p>CDEFGABcdefgab</p>

                <p>
                    And we&#146;re back at yet another C note.
                    The next octave up is shown by an apostrophe immediately after
                    the note name, like <br>

                    c&#146;
                </p>

                <p>
                    So our scale now runs two octaves from
                    middle C:
                </p>

                <p>CDEFGABcdefgabc&#146;</p>

                <p>
                    And using the apostrophe to denote the
                    upper octave we can extend our scale further :
                </p>

                <p>CDEFGABcdefgabc&#146;d&#146;e&#146;f&#146;g&#146;a&#146;b&#146;</p>

                <p>
                    But what about the B immediately <i>below</i>
                    middle C? That octave is shown by a comma immediately following
                    the note name, eg <br>
                    B,
                </p>

                <a name="#noterange"></a>
                <p>
                    We now have four octaves at our disposal,
                    which is more than enough for our purposes of notating
                    traditional music:
                </p>

                <p>
                    C,D,E,F,G,A,B,CDEFGABcdefgabc'd'e'f'g'a'b'
                </p>

                <p>
                    but note that the range can be extended
                    further by adding more commas or apostrophes. A picture paints a thousand words, so

                    Abc allows you to set the &#145;default
                    note length&#146; for each tune. This is set (as a fraction) in
                    the <a href="#altogether">tune header</a> in the L: field.

                <p>
                    So a tune where the default note length is
                    a quaver, or eighth note, would have
                </p>

                <p>L:1/8</p>

                <p>in its header.</p>

                <h4>Why is this important?</h4>

                <p>
                    Because the notes in tunes aren&#146;t
                    always all the same length. By setting a default note length you
                    are setting the value of the most common note length in your
                    tune.
                </p>

                <p>So to return to our C major scale</p>

                <p>CDEFGABcdefgabc'</p>

                <p>
                    If this had a default note length of 1/8,
                    eg the L: field was shown as L:1/8, our scale as shown is a scale
                    of quavers:<br>
                    <img src="images/scale_q.jpg" alt="Scale as quavers"
                         width="240" height="76">
                </p>

                <p>
                    . If the default length was 1/4, eg L:1/4,
                    the <u>same notation of the same scale</u> is now a scale of
                    crotchets:<br>

                    <img src="images/scale_c.jpg" alt="Scale as crotchets"
                         width="245" height="67">
                </p>

                <p>
                    But, as mentioned a bit earlier, the notes
                    in tunes aren&#146;t always all the same length.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    What happens if notes are shorter than the
                    default note length?
                </h4>

                <p>
                    If the particular note you are notating
                    (which, for the sake of brevity, I will from now on call <i>
                        the
                        current note
                    </i>) is half the length of the default note length,
                    it is shown with a forward slash immediately after it, eg<br>

                    C/<br>
                    This can also be written as C/2 if you wish.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the current note is a quarter of the
                    default note length, it is shown like so : C/4
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the current note is an eighth of the
                    default note length, it is shown like so : C/8
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other fractions (/3, /5, /7, /16 etc.) are
                    also legal.

                <h4>
                    What happens if notes are longer than the
                    default note length?
                </h4>

                <p>
                    If the current note is twice the default
                    note length, it is shown like so : C2
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the current note is four times the
                    default note length, it is shown like so : C4
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other multiples (3, 5, 7, 8 etc.) are also
                    legal.
                </p>

                <h4>Remember :</h4>

                <p>
                    The length of any particular note is always
                    calculated according to the default note length of the tune.
                </p>

                <h4>A quick word about hornpipes</h4>

                <p>
                    The hornpipe rhythm is useful to illustrate
                    one more way abc allows the notation of notes of differing
                    length.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A hornpipe could be notated with a default
                    note length of 1/16 like so :
                </p>

                <p>
                    L:1/16<br>
                    D3EF3G
                </p>

                <p>
                    An easier way is to set the default note
                    length to 1/8 and use the greater than &gt; symbol :
                </p>

                <p>
                    L:1/8<br>

                    D&gt;EF&gt;G
                </p>

                <p>
                    The greater than (and less than) sign can
                    be used wherever groups of dotted notes are found.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The &lt; symbol has the same effect in the
                    other direction, eg shortening the first note and lengthening the
                    second, as found in strathspeys etc.
                </p>

                <h4>One last thing about default note lengths</h4>

                <p>

                    However according to the particular tune there is nothing to stop you using
                    a different default note length if it makes the notation easier to read.

                    An L: field can be placed in the middle of a tune to denote a change of default

                    even further by having accidentals in them.

                <p>
                    However : just as standard Western musical
                    notation has the key signature, so that the player automatically

                    Spaces are also used within the melody, and by the various
                    software packages which convert abc into standard notation, to
                    group notes. The spacing of abc notation will tend to
                    mirror the grouping which would be used in standard notation.
                    Spaces may also be inserted at the start
                    and / or end of bars to make the abc more readable.

                <p>
                    Repeats bring the colon : into action. The
                    start of a repeated section is shown by <br>
                    |:<br>

                    and the end of a repeated section by<br>
                    :|
                </p>

                <p>
                    Where the end of one repeated section, and
                    the beginning of the next, coincide,<br>
                    :||:<br>
                    is technically correct, but this is usually shown without the
                    pipe symbols eg <br>
                    ::
                </p>

                <p>
                    Numbered and alternate repeats are indicated by [1 and [2 (etc.). Where the
                    start of a section co-incides with a barline the [ symbol may be omitted, eg
                </p>

                <p>DE FF |[1 GA Bc :|[2 GA BG ||</p>
                <p>can also be written as </p>
                <p>DE FF |1 GA Bc :|2 GA BG ||</p>
                <p>
                    However if a repeat section does <strong><em>not</em></strong> coincide with
                    a barline, always use the [ symbol instead of inserting an extra | .
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that there can be no blank space between the barline and the number -
                    eg [1 and |1 are acceptable, whereas [ 1 and | 1 are not.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Nearly every tune has a title, and one
                    should always be included for identification purposes in tune
                    lists, even if the exact title is not known. The title is
                    indicated by the T: field eg
                </p>

                <p>T:Ballydesmond polka</p>

                <p>
                    A tune may have more than one title - in
                    this case just add a second, third, etc. T: field (each on a new
                    line) and enter the alternative title(s) in there.
                </p>

                <p>There is one more field to introduce at this stage : the X: index field. </p>
                <p>
                    The X: field is primarily for computers' benefit, as they (computers) have
                    much more trouble than human beings in telling where one tune stops and the
                    next starts. Many software packages therefore rely on the X: field to signify
                    the start of a tune, even if there's only one tune in a file, and a blank line,
                    followed by an X: field, delimits one tune from the next. It is therefore good
                    practise to include an X: field at the head of your abc tune(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The X: field is put on the first line of the notation of a tune, and takes
                    the form
                </p>

                <p>X:&lt;number&gt;</p>

                <p>
                    It is good practise (but not absolutely essential) for the X: field to be incremental,
                    eg the first tune in a file is X:1, the second tune in the file is X:2, etc.

                <h3><a name="tempo"></a>The tempo field (Q:)</h3>

                <p>
                    The tempo of a tune is shown in the Q:
                    field, giving either the human or software musician a speed
                    indication, eg<br>

                    Q:120<br>
                    indicates the tempo as 120 notes of the default note length per
                    minute.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Q:1/8 = 120<br>
                    can also be used, to specify in this example that the tune goes at the rate
                    of 120 1/8 notes per minute, regardless of the default note length.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A Q: field can be placed in the middle of a tune to denote a change of tempo
                    - see the <a href="#midtune_changes">Mid-tune changes selection</a> above.

                    An abc notation of a tune has two sections,

                    few important rules :
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The first field of a tune is

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each field in the header occurs on
                            a new line

                            is always the K: field

                            The X: index, T: title, M: meter,
                            L: default note length, and K: key field are
                            obligatory : the others are optional.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The fields usually occur in the
                            following order:<br>
                            X: <br>
                            T:<br>

                    </ul>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    As stated, immediately following the K:
                    field on the next line is the <strong>body</strong> of the tune,
                    eg the representation of the notes of the melody.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If there is a subsequent tune in the abc
                    file there will be at least one blank line after the end of the
                    first melody, then the start of the second tune is denoted by the
                    X: field of the next tune. There should be no blank lines <em>within</em>
                    a tune - whilst human abc readers can cope with this, computers
                    cannot.

                    I welcome comments, good and bad, on the usefulness, clarity, and accuracy
                    of these tutorial pages. Please <a href="../email.htm">
                        email
                        me
                    </a>. Whilst every effort has been made to ensure that the tutorial is an
                    accurate and useful document, I accept no responsibility if the abc you produce
                    as a result of this tutorial is illegible, inaccurate, or does not comply with
                    the peculiarities of the particular piece of software you are using.

                <p>
                    For such a small project the pages have been written in a ludicrous variety
                    of HTML editors, starting life as a Microsoft Word 97 document before progressing
                    through three flavours of FrontPage, <a href="http://www.textpad.com" target="_blank">TextPad</a>,
                    DreamWeaver, and <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>. 
					The images of standard notation were generated in abc2win  
					and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/easyabc/" target="_blank">EasyAbc</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you to everyone who road-tested and commented on this document, particularly
                    Phil Taylor, Jim Vint and Laurie Griffiths (RIP) - part of the credit for the
                    accuracy of this tutorial lies with them, while all errors or omissions are
                    mine alone.

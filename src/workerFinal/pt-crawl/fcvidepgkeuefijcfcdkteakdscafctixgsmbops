           <h1 class="blue">The Chinese Cosmos: Basic Concepts&#42;</h1>
           <p class="blue">To understand Chinese theology (literally &ldquo;discourse about gods&rdquo;), we need to explore theories about human existence, and before that we need to review some of the basic concepts of Chinese cosmology. </p>
           <p><b class="blue">What is the Chinese conception of the cosmos?</b> Any simple answer to that question, of course, merely confirms the biases assumed but not articulated by the question &mdash; that there is only one such authentically Chinese view, and that the cosmos as such, present unproblematically to all people, was a coherent topic of discussion in traditional China. Nevertheless, the answer to that question offered by one scholar of China, Joseph Needham, provides a helpful starting point for the analysis.</p>
           <p>In Needham&rsquo;s opinion, the dominant strand of ancient Chinese thought is remarkable for the way it contrasts with European ideas. While the latter approach the world religiously as created by a transcendent deity or as a battleground between spirit and matter, or scientifically as a mechanism consisting of objects and their attributes, ancient Chinese thinkers viewed the world as a complete and complex &ldquo;organism.&rdquo;</p>
                      <p><a name="qi">&nbsp;</a>&ldquo;Things behaved in particular ways,&rdquo; writes Needham, &ldquo;not necessarily because of prior actions or impulsions of other things, but because their position in the ever-moving cyclical universe was such that they were endowed with intrinsic natures which made that behaviour inevitable for them.&rdquo;<a href="#fn" class="caption_blue">(1)</a> Rather than being created out of nothing, the world evolved into its current condition of complexity out of a prior state of simplicity and undifferentiation. The cosmos continues to change, but there is a consistent pattern to that change discernible to human beings. Observation of the seasons and celestial realms, and methods like plastromancy and scapulimancy (divination using tortoise shells and shoulder blades), dream divination, and manipulating the hexagrams of the <i>Classic of Changes </i>allow people to understand the pattern of the universe as a whole by focusing on the changes taking place in one of its meaningful parts.</p>
          <h2><span class="blue">THE &ldquo;BASIC STUFF&rdquo;: <i>QI</i> </span></h2>
           <p> <span class="blue">The basic stuff out of which all things are made is called <i>qi</i>. </span>Everything that ever existed, at all times, is made of <i>qi</i>, including inanimate matter, humans and animals, the sky, ideas and emotions, demons and ghosts, the undifferentiated state of wholeness, and the world when it is teeming with different beings. </p>
           <p>As an axiomatic concept with a wide range of meaning, the word <i>qi</i> has over the years been translated in numerous ways. Different translators render it into English in three different ways:</p>
           <p>1) &ldquo;psychophysical stuff,&rdquo; because it involves phenomena one would consider both psychological &mdash; connected to human thoughts and feelings &mdash; and physical;<br>
            2) &ldquo;pneuma,&rdquo; drawing on one early etymology of the word as vapor, steam, or breath; and<br>
            3) &ldquo;vital energy,&rdquo; accentuating the potential for life inherent to the more ethereal forms of <i>qi</i>.</p>
           <p> These meanings of <i>qi</i> hold for most schools of thought in early Chinese religion; it is only with the renaissance of Confucian traditions undertaken by Zhu Xi (1130-1200; Song dynasty scholar) and others that <i>qi</i> is interpreted not as a single thing, part-matter and part-energy, pervading everything, but as one of two basic metaphysical building blocks. According to Zhu Xi, all things partake of both <i>qi</i> and <i>li</i> (homophonous to but different from the <i>li</i> meaning &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; or &ldquo;propriety&rdquo;), the latter understood as the reason a thing is what it is and its underlying &ldquo;principle&rdquo; or &ldquo;reason.&rdquo;<a href="#fn" class="caption_blue">(2)</a> </p>
           <h2><a name="yinyang"></a><span class="blue">UNDERSTANDING <i>YIN</i> AND <i>YANG</i></span></h2>
           <p><span class="blue">While traditional cosmology remained monistic, in the sense that <i>qi</i> as the most basic constituent of the universe was a single thing rather than a duality or plurality of things, still <i>qi </i>was thought to move or to operate according to a pattern that did conform to two basic modes. </span>The Chinese words for those two modalities are <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>.</p>
           <p> <i>Yin</i> and <i>yang</i> are best understood in terms of symbolism. When the sun shines on a mountain at some time other than midday, the mountain has one shady side and one sunny side. <i> Yin</i> is the emblem for the shady side and its characteristics; <i>yang</i> is the emblem for the sunny side and its qualities. Since the sun has not yet warmed the <i>yin</i> side, it is dark, cool, and moist; plants are contracted and dormant; and water in the form of dew moves downward. The <i>yang </i>side of the mountain is the opposite of the <i>yin</i> side. It is bright, warm, and dry; plants open up and extend their stalks to catch the sun; and water in the form of fog moves upward as it evaporates. </p>
           <p>This basic symbolism was extended to include a host of other oppositions. <i>Yin </i>is female, <i>yang </i>is male. <i>Yin </i>occupies the lower position, <i>yang </i>the higher. Any situation in the human or natural world can be analyzed within this framework; <i> yin</i> and <i>yang </i>can be used to understand the modulations of <i>qi</i> on a mountainside as well as the relationships within the family. The social hierarchies of gender and age, for instance &mdash; the duty of the wife to honor her husband, and of younger generations to obey older ones &mdash; were interpreted as the natural subordination of <i>yin </i>to <i>yang</i>. The same reasoning can be applied to any two members of a pair. <i>Yin</i>-<i>yang</i> symbolism simultaneously places them on an equal footing and ranks them hierarchically. On the one hand, all processes are marked by change, making it inevitable that <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i> alternate and imperative that humans seek a harmonious balance between the two. On the other hand, the system as a whole attaches greater value to the ascendant member of the pair, the <i>yang</i>. </p>
           <p><a name="yyfs"></a>Such are the philosophical possibilities of the conceptual scheme. Some interpreters of <i>yin</i> and <i>yang </i>choose to emphasize the nondualistic, harmonious nature of the relationship, while others emphasize the imbalance, hierarchy, and conflict built into the idea. </p>
          <p><b class="blue"><i>Yinyang </i>and <i>Qi</i> in Human Beings.</b> How is human life analyzed in terms of the <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i> modes of &ldquo;material energy&rdquo; (yet another rendering of <i>qi</i>)? Health for the individual consists in the harmonious balancing of <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>. When the two modes depart from their natural course, sickness and death result. Sleep, which is dark and therefore <i>yin</i>, needs to be balanced by wakefulness, which is <i>yang</i>. Salty tastes (<i>yin</i>) should be matched by bitter ones (<i>yang</i>); inactivity should alternate with movement; and so on. </p>

           <p>Normally the material energy that constitutes a person, though constantly shifting, is unitary enough to sustain a healthy life. When the material energy is blocked, follows improper patterns, or is invaded by pathogens, then the imbalance between <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i> threatens to pull the person apart, the coarser forms of material energy (which are <i>yin</i>) remaining attached to the body or near the corpse, the more ethereal forms of material energy (which are <i>yang</i>) tending to float up and away. </p>
           <p>Dream-states and minor sicknesses are simply gentler forms of the personal dissociation &mdash; the radical conflict between <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i> &mdash; that comes with spirit-possession, serious illness, and death. At death the material force composing the person dissipates, and even that dissipation follows a pattern analyzable in terms of <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>. The <i>yin</i> parts of the person &mdash; collectively called &ldquo;earthly souls&rdquo; (<i>po</i>) &mdash; move downward, constituting the corpse, perhaps also returning as a ghost to haunt the living. Since they are more like energy than matter, the <i>yang</i> parts of the person &mdash; collectively called &ldquo;heavenly souls&rdquo; (<i>hun</i>) &mdash; float upward. They &mdash; notice that there is more than one of each kind of &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; making a unique soul or even a dualism of the spirit impossible in principle &mdash; are thought to be reborn in Heaven or as another being, to be resident in the ancestral tablets, to be associated more amorphously with the ancestors stretching back seven generations, or to be in all three places at once. </p>
           <h2><a name="god"></a><span class="blue">THE TERM &ldquo;GOD&rdquo; IN THE CONTEXT OF CHINESE RELIGION</span></h2>
           <p> <span class="blue">The complicated term &ldquo;god,&rdquo; in the sense either of a being believed to be perfect in power, wisdom, and goodness or a superhuman figure worthy of worship, does not correspond straightforwardly to a single Chinese term with a similar range of meanings.</span> Instead, there are general areas of overlap, as well as concepts that have no correspondence, between the things we (in the West) would consider &ldquo;gods&rdquo; and specific Chinese terms. Rather than pursuing this question from the side of modern English usage, we begin with the important Chinese terms and explain their range of meanings. <a href="../irc/emperor.htm">[See the topic <b>The Emperor in the Cosmic Orde</b>r for a related discussion on the concept of &ldquo;Heaven.&rdquo;]</a></p>
           <h2><a name="shen"></a><span class="blue">UNDERSTANDING <i>SHEN</i>: HUMAN SPIRIT, GODS AND SPIRITS, AND THE SPIRITUAL</span></h2>
           <p> <span class="blue">One of the terms crucial to understanding Chinese religion is <i>shen</i>, </span>which in this unit is translated with different versions of the English word &ldquo;spirit.&rdquo; Below, these three words are analyzed separately as consisting of three distinct spheres of meaning, but one should keep in mind that the three senses are all rooted in a single Chinese word. They differ only in degree or realm of application, not in kind. </p>
           <p> <span class="blue">The first meaning of <i>shen</i> is confined to the domain of the individual human being: </span>it may be translated as &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;human spirit&rdquo; or &ldquo;psyche.&rdquo; It is the basic power or agency within humans that accounts for life. To extend life to full potential the spirit must be cultivated, resulting in ever clearer, more luminous states of being. In physiological terms &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; is a general term for the &ldquo;heavenly souls,&rdquo; in contrast to the <i>yin</i> elements of the person.</p>
           <p> <span class="blue">The second meaning of <i>shen</i> may be rendered in English as &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; or &ldquo;gods,&rdquo;</span> the latter written in lowercase because Chinese spirits and gods need not be seen as all-powerful, transcendent, or creators of the world. They are intimately involved in the affairs of the world, generally lacking a perch or time frame completely beyond the human realm. An early Chinese dictionary explains: &ldquo;Shen are the spirits of Heaven. They draw out the ten thousand things.&rdquo;<a href="#fn" class="caption_blue">(3)</a> As the spirits associated with objects like stars, mountains, and streams, they exercise a direct influence on things in this world, making phenomena appear and causing things to extend themselves. In this sense of &ldquo;spirits,&rdquo; <i>shen</i> are <i>yang</i> and opposed to the <i>yin</i> class of things known in Chinese as <i>gui</i>, &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; or &ldquo;demons.&rdquo; The two words put together, as in the combined form <i>guishen</i> (&ldquo;ghosts and spirits&rdquo;), cover all manner of spiritual beings in the largest sense, those benevolent and malevolent, lucky and unlucky. In this view, spirits are manifestations of the <i>yang</i> material force, and ghosts are manifestations of the <i>yin</i> material force.</p>
           <p>The nineteenth-century Dutch scholar Jan J. M. de Groot emphasized this aspect of the Chinese worldview, claiming that &ldquo;animism&rdquo; was an apt characterization of Chinese religion because all parts of the universe &mdash; rocks, trees, planets, animals, humans &mdash; could be animated by spirits, good or bad. As support for that thesis he quotes a disciple of Zhu Xi (1130-1200; Song dynasty scholar): &ldquo;Between Heaven and Earth there is no thing that does not consist of <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>, and there is no place where <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i> are not found. Therefore there is no place where gods and spirits do not exist.&rdquo;<a href="#fn" class="caption_blue">(4)</a> </p>
           <p><span class="blue"><i>Shen</i> in its third meaning  can be translated as &ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo;</span> An entity is &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; in the sense of inspiring awe or wonder because it combines categories usually kept separate, or it cannot be comprehended through normal concepts. The <i>Classic of Changes</i> states, &ldquo;&lsquo;Spiritual&rsquo; means not measured by <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>.&rdquo;<a href="#fn" class="caption_blue">(5)</a> Things that are numinous cross categories. They cannot be fathomed as either <i>yin</i> or <i>yang</i>, and they possess the power to disrupt the entire system of <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>. A related synonym, one that emphasizes the power of such spiritual things, is <i>ling</i>, meaning &ldquo;numinous&rdquo; or possessing unusual spiritual characteristics. Examples that are considered <i>shen</i> in the sense of &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; include albino members of a species; beings that are part-animal, part-human; women who die before marriage and turn into ghosts receiving no care; people who die in unusual ways like suicide or on battlefields far from home; and people whose bodies fail to decompose or emit strange signs after death.</p>
           <p> <span class="blue">The fact that these three fields of meaning (&ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;spirits,&rdquo; and &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;) can be traced to a single word has important implications for analyzing Chinese religion. Perhaps most importantly, it indicates that there is no unbridgeable gap separating humans from gods or, for that matter, separating good spirits from demons. All are composed of the same basic stuff, <i>qi</i>, and there is no ontological distinction between them. Humans are born with the capacity to transform their spirit into one of the gods of the Chinese pantheon. </span></p>

The principle for something could be moral or  physical; for example, the principle for wives is essentially moral in nature,  that for trees, physical.

The theory of  principle and vital energy allowed Song thinkers to validate Mencius&rsquo;s claim of  the goodness of human nature and still explain human wrongdoing: principle  underlying human beings is good, but their endowment of vital energy is more or  less impure, giving rise to selfish impulses.&rdquo;<i><br>

           <p>The <i>Taiji</i> diagram (<i>taiji tu</i>) first appeared in a Taoist [Daoist] context   at the beginning of the Song dynasty (960-1279). ... Prior to this, <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i> were symbolized by the tiger and the dragon, and this symbolism has continued throughout the history of later Taoism [Daoism]. The diagram symbolizes the unity of the forces of <i>yin </i>and <i>yang</i> within the [D]ao. <i>Taiji</i> means &ldquo;supreme ultimate,&rdquo; and as such the diagram symbolizes the fundamental Taoist view of the structure of reality, namely that beyond the duality of phenomenal existence, created through the interaction of <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>, is the unity of the Tao [Dao], which exists beyond time and space. ... The <i>Compendium of Diagrams (Tushubian)</i> is a 127-chapter encyclopedia on cosmology, geography, and human life compiled in the early Wanli reign (1573-1620) by the scholar Zhang Huang. </p>

                             <p>Sometimes  described as &ldquo;complementary bipolarity,&rdquo;<i> yin</i> and <i>yang</i> can be defined as 1) cosmic forces that produce and animate all natural phenomena; 2) terms used to identify recurrent cyclical  patterns of rise and decline, waxing and waning; and 3) comparative  categories, describing dualistic relationships that were inherently unequal but  almost invariably complementary. Virtually any aspect of Chinese experience could be explained in terms of  these paired concepts, ranging from such mundane sensory perceptions as dark  and light, wet and dry, to abstractions such as real and unreal, being and  nonbeing. <i>Yinyang</i> relationships involved the notion of mutual dependence and harmony based on hierarchical difference. <i>Yin</i> qualities were generally considered inferior to <i>yang</i> qualities, but unity of opposites was always the cultural ideal. The accommodating and essentially naturalistic outlook expressed in this notion of <i>yinyang </i>complementarity contrasts sharply with the familiar religious dualisms of good and evil, God and the Devil, which are so prominent in the ancient Near Eastern and Western cultural traditions. </p>

<p>The popular form of geomantic divination known as <i>fengshui</i> (literally, &ldquo;wind-water&rdquo;) was predicated on the belief that <i>yinyang</i> currents of cosmic breath (<i>qi</i>), which flowed in every geographic area, influenced human fortunes. These currents, subject to various astrological influences, including &ldquo;star spirits,&rdquo; manifested themselves in local topography. The task of a geomancer (<i>fengshui xiansheng</i>) was to calculate, on the basis of an enormous number of topographical and astrological variables, the most favorable positions to locate residences for both the living (homes, temples, businesses, official buildings, etc.) and the dead (graves).</p>

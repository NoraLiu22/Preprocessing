      <p> Of all frontier shape-note tune books,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Missouri_Harmony"><i> The Missouri Harmony</i></a> was
        the most popular among the settlers who pushed the frontier up the Mississippi 
        River and its tributaries. The 1820 compilation contained 185 old favorites 
        used in singing schools and Protestant churches. Included were ancient 
        psalms like &quot;Old Hundred,&quot; congregational hymns like &quot;All 
        Praise the Power of Jesus' Name,&quot; vernacular New England choral works 
        by eighteenth-century tunesmiths like William Billings, and a number of 
        folk hymns out of the Anglo-Celtic oral tradition. Many of the songs were 
        already old by 1820, and the music was deeply rooted in American culture. 
      <p>In time, composer Virgil Thompson would find in the old shape-note hymns 
        &quot;the musical basis of almost everything we make, of Negro spirituals, 
        of cowboy songs, of popular ballads, of blues, of hymns, of doggerel ditties, 
        of all our operas and symphonies.&quot; Certainly their vernacular idiom 
        was absorbed into the marrow of musical culture.  Abraham Lincoln and his
        sweetheart, Ann Rutledge, are said to have sung from <i>The Missouri Harmony</i> 
        at her father's tavern in New Salem, Illinois. Despite its importance, 
        the book has been unavailable to contemporary choral and church music 
        communities, including the thriving shape-note tradition of folk singers 
        and Protestant worshipers. </p>
      <p>The book was printed from 1820 until 1856 when it languished. By 1970, 
        fewer than 90 copies were known to exist in libraries. In 1993, a partnership 
        between Wings of Song (the St. Louis Shape Note Singers' incorporated 
        organization) and Dr. Shirley Bean, music professor at UM-Kansas City 
        produced a softbound facsimile of the 1846 edition of <i>The Missouri 
        Harmony</i>. As exciting as it was to have access to the music, the book 
        was soon deemed impossible to use for singing. The soft cover makes it 
        difficult to hold open, and the small type and numerous typos leave much 
        to be desired when sight singing. The new edition addresses those needs.</p>
      <p>Special software for typesetting music in shaped notation made it possible 
        to re-set the compositions and create a singer's volume. Wings of Song 
        has joined with the Missouri Historical Society to produce a top-quality 
        hardbound revised edition of <i>The Missouri Harmony.</i> The first new 
        edition of this book since 1856 is once again available for use in singing 
        schools, church services and folk music academies. The hardbound edition 
        contains 350 pages, including new and old music. 
        A narrative introduction by Karen Isbell and Pete Ellertsen, 
        with photos and illustrations, places the shape-note musical tradition 
        in its historical context. An essay by Judy Hauff discusses the characteristics 
        of the music and the traditional approach to singing it. A third essay, 
        by award winning author Ann Leckie, traces the formation and history of the St. Louis 
        Shape Note singers. Notes from the music committee, written by Dave Ressler, 
        are included, as is an index of hymn titles first lines.</p>

	<p class="text_centered"><a href="copyright.htm">Copyright</a> 2007 - 2016 Michael 
	Kasten</p>
	<h3>Concept</h3>
	<p>The 50 meter wooden charter yacht shown here is modeled after the 
	traditional Indonesian <b>Kapal Layar Mesin</b> - which means 
	"boat-sail-machine." In Indonesia the type is just called "<b>KLM</b>."   
	In the West we call it a "<b>Motor Sailor</b>."   </p>
	<p>The prototype shown above is a larger version of the relatively much 
	smaller
	<a href="kapal_layar_mesin.htm">30 Meter KLM</a> and
	<a href="kapal_layar_mesin_36.htm">36 Meter KLM</a> types we previously 
	developed during prior visits to Indonesia in 2004 and 2006.  At 50 
	meters on deck this design is large enough to carry the 'double deck' very 
	handsomely.  It is also large enough to accommodate 6 luxury suites 
	below forward, plus two ultra luxury suites on the upper Bridge Deck aft - 
	all without any sense of being crowded.  </p>
	<p>As is evident in the image above, in contrast to the many so-called 
	'Motor Sailing' charter vessels plying Indonesian waters, this vessel can 
	also become a very capable true sailing vessel.&nbsp; All that is required 
	is ample sail area and additional keel timbers.&nbsp; The rig must be kept 
	low, and the sails must be of manageable proportions, therefore multiple 
	masts are a natural solution.&nbsp; More about this below...</p>
	<p>Preliminary particulars are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>50 Meters Length on Deck.  </li>
		<li>40m DWL</li>
		<li>14m Beam</li>
		<li>5m Draft</li>
		<li>850 - 900 Metric Tons Displacement</li>
	</ul>
	
		<p>Imperial Dimensions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>164' Length on Deck</li>
			<li>170' Hull Length, including stem</li>
			<li>190' Length Overall, including bowsprit</li>		
		</ul>
	<br />
	
	<h3>A Better Sail Rig...?</h3>
	<p>Typically, a cargo carrying KLM will be arranged with a fore mast only, 
	and although there is a sail present, it is not intended for any 'real' 
	sailing.&nbsp; Its main purpose is to gain a 'sailing 
	ship' tax advantage for the owner.  The sail is also available as 
	"get-home" propulsion in the event of engine failure, though obviously any 
	destination under sail alone would have to be directly down wind...!  </p>
	<p>In this case we were presented with the request to create a workable sail rig for a larger 
	KLM.&nbsp; Since these vessels are rather heavy and need quite a lot of sail area, we 
	concluded that the best arrangement would be to use multiple masts. This is 
	especially so since the locally 
	available timbers are limited to approximately 18 to 20 meters in length.&nbsp; The images 
	above and below here show what seemed to work best:</p>
	<p class="table_text_centered">
	<a href="_screenshots/50m_sailing_klm_aft.jpg">
	<img alt="50m Motor Sailing Charter Pinisi - Kasten Marine Design, Inc." class="auto-style2" height="564" src="_screenshots/50m_sailing_klm_aft.jpg" width="900" /></a><br /> &nbsp;
	<a href="_screenshots/50m_sailing_klm_fwd.jpg">Four-mast Rig Forward View</a>   
	|   <a href="_screenshots/50m_sailing_klm_aft.jpg">Four-mast Rig 
	Aft View</a><br /> &nbsp; </p>
	<p>Using this strategy, all gaff sails and gaff tops'ls are identical, 
	therefore interchangeable. Balance is easily achieved in any wind strength.</p>
	<p>The four mast rig would be ideally suited to larger 'sailing Pinisi' 
	types as well, and for the same reasons, i.e. to provide ample sail area; to keep spar 
	lengths to reasonable proportions; to provide myriad sail combinations for the best 
	balance; to keep individual sail sizes to a minimum and thus make the entire 
	rig much more easily handled; and to allow ample sail area without excessive 
	heeling moment.  </p>
	<p>Even though this strategy was pursued in order to get the most sail area 
	on the shortest spar length in order to use local <strong>timbers</strong>, by far the best 
	material for the spars would be to use <b>steel</b> tube or 
	pipe...!&nbsp; If designed correctly, once painted, to the casual observer 
	they will appear as though made of 
	wood.&nbsp; If properly prepared and painted, steel spars will outlast 
	wooden spars and be easier maintain.&nbsp; As a bonus, steel spars will be 
	easier to build, and... they will also be lighter.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>The Intent...</h3>
	<p>For the interior, the intent with this concept and other vessels of our 
	design is that the interior layout make it possible for the vessel to be used 
	in either of two modes: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>As a personal world-traveling yacht for a private owner and 
			guests, or </li>
			<li>For use as a charter yacht with "managed ownership."</li>
		</ul>

	<p>By "managed ownership" we mean that the yacht is privately owned, but is 
	managed by a charter company who is able to charter the vessel when it is 
	not being used by the owner. In exchange for its use, the charter company 
	takes care of the vessel's maintenance and repairs, and provides the owner 
	with an income stream. Done correctly, this is a rather ideal way to own a 
	boat - no maintenance, it pays its own way, and the owner can step aboard a 
	well maintained vessel nearly any time and simply enjoy their time aboard 
	rather than having to manage the vessel's upkeep.</p>
	<p>Comfort and privacy have been primary goals. Given the overall size, the 
	interior layout is not at all crowded. Given that the vessel will be sailing 
	in the tropics, excellent ventilation has been given the highest priority. 
	Each cabin has a private head and shower and all accommodation spaces are 
	air conditioned.
	<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>The Interior Layout</h3>
	<p>To best understand what I've proposed for the interior of this vessel, it 
	will be helpful to study the layout of our <a href="50m_phinisi.htm">50m 
	Sailing Pinisi</a> design.  The layout we have in mind for the 50m KLM 
	is very similar, except that due to the width of the stern there would be 
	considerably more room in the Grand Suite on the Bridge Deck, in the Galley 
	on the Main Deck, and in the Crew Quarters below aft.  Another 
	difference is in the division of the cabins, due to the mast locations.</p>
	<p>Below I will briefly walk through the layout we have in mind - one that 
	is eminently suited to high end luxury charters throughout SE Asia.  It 
	will also be very helpful to view the
	<a href="_screenshots/50m_klm_lines_fwd.gif">Lines Fwd</a> and the
	<a href="_screenshots/50m_klm_lines_aft.gif">Lines Aft</a> images in order 
	to visualize the interior spaces.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>Below Decks</h3>
	<p>Right forward below the main deck is of course the fore peak, having two 
	compartments, the forward-most of which would be the chain locker, and just 
	aft of that the Bosun's locker for general storage of ship's gear. </p>
	<p>Throughout the forward lower deck aft of that, there are three equally 
	sized divisions 6 meters in length each.  Separated by a lengthwise 
	hallway down the center, those are intended to become five or six Deluxe Cabins
	with en-suite luxury bath and shower. A  centerline hallway is intended 
	to lead from a forward companionway all the way aft to the lounge on the 
	main deck amidships. This type of general layout can be seen very clearly in 
	the
	<a href="_drawings/50m_phinisi_lower_dk_plan.gif">50m Sailing Pinisi Lower 
	Deck Plan</a>. </p>
	<p>Aft of this array of luxury suites is the engine room, sized in order to 
	adequately house all the support systems for luxury chartering, including 
	three generators, dive compressor, high pressure storage tanks, a redundant 
	air conditioning system and large capacity reverse osmosis system for 
	replenishing the fresh water supply.</p>
	<p>Aft of the Engine Room are the crew mess, laundry, and crew cabins.  
	These are also generous, allowing for approximately 15 to 18 crew without 
	any crowding.</p>
	<p>Right aft, below the main deck is a spacious Lazarette for general 
	storage of ship's gear, backup dive gear and other spares.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>The Main Deck</h3>
	<p>The Main Deck can be best visualized by inspecting the
	<a href="_screenshots/50m_klm_lines_fwd.gif">Lines Fwd</a> and the
	<a href="_screenshots/50m_klm_lines_aft.gif">Lines Aft</a> images, and also 
	by studying the <a href="_drawings/50m_phinisi_main_dk_plan.gif">50m Sailing 
	Pinisi Main Deck Layout</a>.   The Fore Deck is intended to be 
	quite large and open.  It is after all the preferred socializing area 
	during the day and well into the night...!</p>
	<p>Amidships on the Main Deck is a Lounge for the guests.  
	The array of windows provides a sense of spaciousness so the view is 
	undiminished even while spending time inside.  The lounge will have a 
	stairway leading directly to the hallway below, which provides quick access 
	to the guest suites below forward. </p>
	<p>Aft of the lounge is another stairway, leading to port and upward to the 
	Bridge Deck, and the two very large guest suites located there.  
	Another stairway below that one leads down to the Crew Mess, the Crew Cabins 
	and the Engine Room</p>
	<p>Aft of the Main Deck stairwell is the galley with walk-in cool room, a 
	large dive shop, and a cozy communications room / library.</p>
	<p>At the aft end of the Main Deck is another exterior social area / lounge 
	- but one that is covered and therefore out of the sun and weather.  
	This is the best gathering spot for an informal Barbeque on deck or for 
	staging a dive adventure or fishing or just for general hanging out... <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>The Bridge Deck</h3>
	<p>The Bridge Deck layout can be visualized rather well by reviewing the
	<a href="_screenshots/50m_klm_lines_fwd.gif">Lines Fwd</a> and the
	<a href="_screenshots/50m_klm_lines_aft.gif">Lines Aft</a> images, and by 
	studying the <a href="_drawings/50m_phinisi_bridge_dk_plan.gif">50m Sailing 
	Pinisi Bridge Deck Layout</a>.  </p>
	<p>First, at the forward end of the Bridge Deck is a spacious 'Promenade 
	Deck' located above the Lounge, and just forward of the Bridge.  
	This extends the full width of the vessel, and provides yet another private 
	place to get some sun or just a bit more privacy from the on-deck 
	activities.  Just aft of that, the Bridge itself provides a piloting 
	area that spans the width of the ship.  Aft of the Bridge is the main 
	stairwell, a day-head, the Captain's quarters to starb'd and a ship's office 
	to port.  </p>
	<p>In the 50m Sailing Pinisi, the stern is much more narrow, so there is 
	one large Grand Suite aft.   On this vessel, the stern has 
	sufficient width to achieve <u>two</u> ultra deluxe suites, one to port and 
	one to starb'd, separated along the centerline.  These each look out to 
	a vast panorama, having windows all around.  Even so, privacy is 
	assured by the location.  The entry to each of these suites is at the 
	forward end, directly from the sides of the Promenade Deck.  Each suite 
	has a large private Veranda Deck right aft, separated along the centerline 
	for complete privacy.  These Bridge Deck luxury suites would be second 
	to none... </p>
	<p>Unless of course those two suites were combined into a single truly 
	magnificent Grand Suite...! <br /> &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>More Information...?</h3>
	<p>
		An interesting article on our work with these vessels appeared in the 
		New York Times, called
		<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/fashion/22iht-ACAYPIN.html?pagewanted=all">The Traditional Pinisi - And Then Some</a>.&nbsp; 
		For a taste of what is possible with these craft, please see our
		<a href="kapal_layar_mesin_36.htm">Dunia Baru</a> web page where you 
		will find excellent as-built images.</p>
	<p>If this or a similar Pinisi  / luxury sailing yacht is of interest, we offer a thorough design service.  
		Our preference is to take advantage of traditional methods to the maximum extent possible, but to bring the 
		construction standard up to a classification society compliant structure.  We offer our custom design 
		services by which we can modify these types of vessels to suit a variety of requests to change the size or to 
		modify the layout as needed, and then follow that up with our local knowledge in order to facilitate 
		construction.

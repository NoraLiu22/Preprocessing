<div id="mn"> <h3> The Tooth </h3>
<p>

The tooth is an amazing sensory organ.  The outside of the tooth, the
<strong>enamel</strong>, is the hardest tissue in the human body.  The
enamel surrounds another layer of the tooth called the 
<strong>dentin</strong>.  
The tooth pulp lies in the middle of the tooth.  The
pulp contains blood vessels, nerve fibers and other connective tissue.  
Although the pulp has several functions, including the formation of
dentin, the sensory function of teeth is quite interesting.</p>

<p>The nerve fibers <strong>inside</strong> teeth are exquisitely
sensitive to stimulation when they can be activated. If you have ever had
a cracked tooth or had a cavity in a tooth, you know that the message sent
to the brain by the teeth is <strong>PAIN!!!</strong>.  (The
existence of a nonpainful sensory function of teeth is being debated in
the current scientific literature).  However, in undamaged teeth, the
sensory fibers in teeth appear to be "quiet".<img src="toothsm.gif"
alt="tooth"  class="flr" /></p>

<p>You may be thinking..."Wait a minute.  If I touch my teeth, I feel the
touch and it doesn't hurt.  So the teeth must send nonpainful signals." It
is true, of course, that if you touch your teeth you feel the touch.
However, the sensation you feel is NOT the result of activating nerve
fibers INSIDE the tooth.  Rather, touching the tooth activates nerve
fibers in the <strong>periodontal ligament</strong> (the ligament
that surrounds the tooth) that are very sensitive to slight displacement
of the tooth.</p>

<p><img src="toothic.gif" alt="small tooth"  class="fl"  />However, if the
tooth is damaged by decay or trauma, the nerve fibers inside the tooth may
respond to external stimuli and when they are, you are sure to feel
pain.</p>

<p>Just for the record, children usually have 20 baby teeth (also called 
milk
teeth). Adults have 32 permanent teeth.  The 32 teeth in adults include
the 3rd molars, also called the wisdom teeth.  In some people the
wisdom teeth do not come in at all.

These facts from Wynbrandt, J., <i>The Excruciating History of
Dentistry</i>, New York:  St. Martin's Press, 1998.
<ul><li>The ancient Babylonians believed that demons and
worms caused toothaches.</li>
<li>Hippocrates recommended that teeth be cleaned with a ball of wool
moistened with honey.</li>
<li>Galen (129-201 A.D.), a famous Roman anatomist, advised
people with toothaches to rub their gums with the brains of a hare.</li>
<li>American patriot Paul Revere was also a dentist.</li>
<li>The toothbrush appeared in Europe (possibly first in France) in the
late middle ages.</li>
<li>A toothpick factory can manufacture about 20 million toothpicks in one
day.</li>
<li>The giant anteater has NO teeth. (Source: Naples, V.L., 
Morphology, evolution and function of feeding in the giant anteater 
<i>Myrmecophaga fridactyla</i>, J. Zoology, 249:19-41, 1999).</li>

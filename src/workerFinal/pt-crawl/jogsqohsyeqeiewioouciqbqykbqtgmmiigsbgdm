<strong>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [MMWR]</strong><br>

<br>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
<p>A Cluster of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia among
Homosexual Male Residents of Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California
</center>

<p>In the period October 1980-May 1981, 5 young men, all active homosexuals,
were treated for biopsy-confirmed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia at 3 different
hospitals in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp; Two of the patients died.&nbsp;
All 5 patients had laboratory-confirmed previous or current cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infection and candidal mucosal infection.&nbsp; Case reports of these
patients follow.
<p>Patient 1:&nbsp; A <b>previously healthy 33-year-old man</b> developed
P. carinii pneumonia and oral mucosal candidiasis in <b>March 1981</b>
after a 2-month history of fever associated with elevated liver enzymes,
leukopenia, and CMV viruria....&nbsp; He died May 3, and postmortem examination
showed residual P. carinii and CMV pneumonia, but no evidence of neoplasia.
<p>Patient 2:&nbsp; A <b>previously healthy 30-year-old man</b> developed
p. carinii pneumonia in <b>April 1981</b> after a 5-month history of fever
each day and of elevated liver-function tests, CMV viruria,....&nbsp; His
pneumonia responded to a course of intravenous TMP/.SMX, but, as of the
latest reports, he continues to have a fever each day.
<p>Patient 3:&nbsp; A <b>30-year-old man was well until January 1981</b>
when he developed esophageal and oral candidiasis that responded to Amphotericin
B treatment.&nbsp; He was hospitalized in February 1981 for P. carinii
pneumonia....
<p>Patient 4:&nbsp; A <b>29-year-old man</b> developed P. carinii pneumonia
in <b>February 1981</b>....&nbsp; He did not improve ... and died in March....
<p>Patient 5:&nbsp; A <b>previously healthy 36-year-old man</b> with clinically
diagnosed CMV infection in September 1980 was seen in <b>April 1981</b>
because of a 4-month history of fever, dyspnea, and cough.&nbsp; On admission
he was found to have P. carinii pneumonia, oral candidiasis, and CMV retinitis....
<p>The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia was confirmed for all 5 patients
antemortem by closed or open lung biopsy.&nbsp; The patients did not know
each other and had no known common contacts or knowledge of sexual partners
who had had similar illnesses.&nbsp; The 5 reported having frequent homosexual
contacts with various partners.&nbsp; All 5 reported using inhalant drugs,
and 1 reported parenteral [<font size=-1>injected</font>] drug abuse....
<p>Reported by MS Gottlieb, MD, <i>et al</i>., Div of Clinical Immunology-Allergy;
Dept of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine; I Pozalski, MD, Cedars-Mt. Sinai
Hospital, Los Angeles; Field services Div, Epidemiology Program Office,
CDC.
<p>Editorial Note:&nbsp; Pneumocystis pneumonia in the United States is
almost exclusively limited to severely immunosuppressed patients....&nbsp;
The occurrence of pneumocystosis in these 5 previously healthy individuals
without a clinically apparent underlying immunodeficiency is unusual.&nbsp;
The fact that these patients were all homosexuals suggests an association
between some aspect of a homosexual lifestyle or disease acquired through
sexual contact and Pneumocystis pneumonia in this population....
<p>All the above observations suggest the possibility of a cellular-immune
dysfunction related to a common exposure that predisposes individuals to
opportunistic infections such as pneumocystosis and candidiasis.&nbsp;
Although the role of CMV infection in the pathogenesis of pneumocystosis
remains unknown, the possibility of P. carinii infection must be carefully
considered in a differential diagnosis for previously healthy homosexual
males with dyspnea and pneumonia.

  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFF99"><p>What's in a name?&nbsp; A lot, when it comes to an unrecognized infections disease that spreads by intimate person-to-person contact.&nbsp; While not difficult to prevent if detected, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) differs from other communicable diseases in two respects.&nbsp; First, the virus is closely identified with gays, and has become entwined in gay political concerns such as open identification, discrimination and social acceptance.&nbsp; Second, those who harbor the virus have become vocal and organized.&nbsp; They serve as a strong lobbying force against legislative actions that limit their personal freedoms, which sometimes involve viral transmission.</p>
      <p>HIV remains a cunning foe, difficult to treat and rid from the body, but not hard to prevent if the identity of the HIV-infected person is known.&nbsp; In general, health departments in the majority of states that now have named HIV reporting (31 at last count, but not California) make good use of the identity of HIV-infected persons.&nbsp; The gathered data are easily checked for duplication in count, thereby improving the quality of the surveillance system.&nbsp; Contact is maintained with persons who are infected and their susceptible spouses or sexual partners.&nbsp; Such susceptible persons can then protect themselves from HIV by avoiding sexual or blood contact, or by reducing their risk with condoms, withdrawal or use of clean needles.</p>
    <p>For HIV-infected persons, treatment is an expensive long-term undertaking that requires follow-up and support beyond what is offered by busy physicians.&nbsp; Having names helps health departments maintain such contact and encourages public support for the cost of therapy.&nbsp; Finally, in the case of pregnancy, having a name allows medical and public health workers to ensure early treatment, necessary to preserve the life of the newborn child.&nbsp; For these reasons, I strongly support named HIV reporting, along with confidentiality safeguards that are standard when dealing with sexually transmitted diseases.</td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><p>One-third of HIV-infected persons in Los Angeles County are not aware of their infection.&nbsp; Of those who do know, at least 25 percent are not receiving care.&nbsp; Named reporting will do almost nothing to help identify and assist these persons, who contribute most heavily to the continued spread of HIV. </p>
      <p>A small but significant proportion of individuals will decline testing or services if their names are to be confidentially reported to an agency of the state.&nbsp; The actual risk of disclosure by public health staff is infinitesimal, but this is beside the point.&nbsp; Fear, regardless of whether it is founded in reality, is the main barrier to testing and care.&nbsp; Public health must address the continued social stigma underlying these fears.&nbsp; Instead, advocates of named reporting have fueled fear, even if unintentionafly.&nbsp; They have tactically allied with political forces indifferent or hostile to HIV/AIDS care and to the people who are living with AIDS.&nbsp; Such tactics alienate the HIV-infected and affected communities, whose massive involvement in advocacy, prevention and social support has been a powerful engine of progress against HIV. </p>
      <p>Fundamentally, emphasizing named reporting diverts our attention from what would really work: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extend access to care to all, for real. </li>
        <li>Vastly expand voluntary HIV testing, using new technologies and new venues. </li>
        <li>Establish sensitive, community-based partner counseling and referral services. </li>
        <li>Create acceptable transrnission-prevention programs for HIV-infected persons. </li>
        <li>Supplement surveillance with sampling and modeling to periodically estimate the prevalence and incidence of HIV in the total population. </li>
    </ul>      <p>With treatment advances rendering AIDS ever more arbitrary, we do need expanded surveillance to monitor and plan.&nbsp; A non-name-based unique identifier system can meet this need, with only modest loss of efficiency.</td>

<p>For years it was stated that men had forty-eight chromosomes in their
cells; there were pictures to prove it, and any number of careful studies.&nbsp;
In 1953, a group of American researchers announced to the world that the
human chromosome number was forty-six.&nbsp; Once more, there were pictures
to prove it, and studies to confirm it.&nbsp; But these researchers also
went back to reexamine the old pictures, and the old studies--and found
only forty-six chromosomes not forty-eight.

  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;The Microbe is so very small&nbsp;
              <br>
&nbsp;You cannot make him out at all, <br>
&nbsp;But many sanguine people hope <br>
&nbsp;To see him down a microscope. <br>
&nbsp;His jointed tongue that lies beneath <br>
&nbsp;A hundred curious rows of teeth; <br>
&nbsp;His seven tufted tails with lots <br>
&nbsp;Of lovely pink and purple spots, <br>
&nbsp;On each of which a pattern stands, <br>
&nbsp;Composed of forty separate bands; <br>
&nbsp;His eyebrows of a tender green; <br>
&nbsp;All these have never yet been seen-- <br>
&nbsp;But Scientists, who ought to know, <br>
&nbsp;Assure us they must be so.... <br>
&nbsp;Oh! let us never, never doubt <br>
&nbsp;What nobody is sure about!</p>

                    often seen quote above by famous geneticist Dobzhansky elegantly 
                    captures the paramount importance of evolution. Stated differently, 
                    evolution is the single organizing principle of all the biological 
                    sciences. The terms evolution and <A HREF="Evolution/OriginofSpecies.htm">natural 
                    selection</A> are often used synonymously, though natural 
                    selection itself is but one of the mechanisms by which evolution 
                    operates. The mechanisms of evolution are ubiquitous and not 
                    limited to biology, and as a theory, evolution is as <A HREF="Evolution/evolution-segues/Futuyma_quote.htm">validated</A> 
                    as Newton's Laws of Motion, and clearly as important for the 
                    understanding of the physical world. Yet, and paradoxically, 
                    evolution is either misunderstood or even adamantly denied 
                    by a large proportion of the public. </FONT> </P>
                  <P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Evolution is the change over time of inherited traits found
                    in a population of individuals. Inherited traits are distinguishing
                    characteristics comprising a phenotype encompassing such
                    observables as physiology, anatomy, biochemistry and behavior
                    that are passed on from one generation to the next. Evolution
                    acts on existing variation of inherited traits encoded within
                    genes of the population (gene pool). New variants of inherited
                    traits can enter a population from outside populations, a
                    process referred to as gene flow. Additionally, variation
                    can enter a population's gene pool in at least three ways:
                    1) mutation of DNA,; 2) epimutation (a change inherited in
                    some way other than through the sequence of nucleotides in
                    DNA), and genetic recombination. Natural selection, where
                    different inherited traits cause different rates of survival
                    and reproduction, can cause new variants to amplify within
                    a population. Other evolutionary mechanisms can cause a variant
                    to become common even if the variant does not directly cause
                    improved survival or reproduction. These mechanisms include
                    genetic hitchhiking, genetic drift, and recurrent biased
                  mutation or migration.</font></P>

                    affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes 
                    been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely 
                    speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent 
                    existing species; and those produced during each former year 
                    may represent the long succession of extinct species . . . The 
                    limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and 
                    lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, 
                    budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present 
                    buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification 
                    of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups 
                    . . . From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch 
                    has decayed and dropped off, and these lost branches of various 
                    sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera 
                    which have now no living representatives, and which are known 
                    to us only from having been found in a fossil state . . . As 
                    buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, 
                    branch out and overtop on all a feebler branch, so by generation 
                    I believe it has been with the Tree of Life, which fills with 
                    its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers 
                    the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications&quot; (Charles
                    Darwin, 1859).</em></FONT></p>

                <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, 
                    misconceptions about evolution are ubiquitous. One prominent 
                    misconception is that evolution proceeds in a specific direction 
                    leading to the improvement of organisms - this is often stated 
                    as climbing an evolutionary ladder. This is simply not the case. 
                    Rather, organisms either adapt to environments that are always 
                    undergoing change, or they risk extinction.</FONT></P>
                <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><IMG SRC="images/dna_2.gif" ALT="DNA" WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="101" hspace="10" ALIGN="LEFT">The 
                    <B>concept of the ladder</B> may comfort some, especially
                    since it justifies assigning humans to the pinnacle of perfection.
                    Natural selection does not work that way. Rather, nature
                    uses
                  what is available (i.e., in genomic diversity), keeps what
                    works, and discards the rest; actually, the genetic material
                    is not
                  discarded, but is turned off -- most of the human genome comprises
                    unused sequences that are a legacy of evolution. Nature abounds
                    with organisms that humans would never &quot;design&quot; as 
                  perfect. The &quot;lowly&quot; sponge and the jellyfish are 
                  two examples; these creatures with a few simple cell types have 
                  persisted from the Precambrian, and have changed very little. 
                  Other ancient creatures that survive because of specialized 
                  adaptation are fungi, mosses, sharks, and horseshoe crabs. Thus, 
                  in the context of natural selection, fitness is inextricably 
                  linked to the environment (and adaptation to changes), and NOT 
                  to progress or perfection. &quot;Evolutionary ladder&quot; is,
                  in fact, an oxymoron.</FONT></P>

                  variation is what evolution acts upon within a single kind to

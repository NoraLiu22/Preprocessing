<h2>Chapter VII<br>The Pacific War</h2>
</center>

The failure in 1938 of the Japanese
attack at Lake Khassan had revealed the unexpected
military strength of the U.S.S.R. in the Far East.
The conclusion on 23rd August 1939 of the Non-Aggression
Pact between Germany and the U.S.S.R.
and the preoccupation of Germany with her war
against Britain and France had freed the U.S.S.R.
for the time being of anxiety as to her Western
Frontiers. Japan's advance to the North, hitherto
intended to be the first step in the realization of
her national policy, was now deferred until a better
opportunity presented itself.
<p>
As the door of opportunity closed in
the North, the Southern gates began to open, and
Japan took various steps preliminary to the
realization of the second major part of her
national policy, the advance to the South.
France and Britain suffered a grave rebuff at
Munich in September 1938. Thereafter, Prince
Konoye, on 3rd November 1938, publicly declared
Japan's intention to establish the New Order in
East Asia; and in that same month, Japan announced
that she could no longer apply the Treaty System
unconditionally. She said that the application

of the principles of "The Open Door" and "Equal
Opportunity" might have to yield in face of the
changed conditions in China. in that same month
of November 1938, the Five Ministers' Conference
decided to capture Hainan Island. That island
was taken in February 1939 and the Sprately Islands
in March 1939.
<p>
In September 1939, there came war
between Germany and Poland, France and Britain.
At once, we find Ambassador OSHIMA and General
Terauchi speaking of the advisability of Japan
advancing to the South: from the month of
September 1939 onwards, the attitude of the
Japanese military in China towards foreign
interests was noticeably more intransigent;
and about that time, the Japanese began to bomb
the Yunnan Railway. In November 1939, the
Japanese Foreign Office demanded that France
should cease forwarding military supplies over
the Yunnan Railway to China and should admit
a Japanese Military mission to French Indo-China
to see that no such supplies went forward.
Nothing could better advertise Japanese aggressiveness
in the South, for France was entitled to
forward these supplies, and there was as yet no
indication that French military strength would
be broken. Nevertheless, Japan felt strong enough
to present these demands upon France, in view of
France's preoccupation with the war in Europe.
On 2nd November 1940, Japan presented to the
Netherlands demands which, if granted, would have
given her a preferential position among the

<p><center><i>--844--</i></center><hr><a name=page845></a><p>
<blockquote>

nations in respect to the economy of the
Netherlands East Indies. In March 1490, KOISO
told the Diet Committee of Accounts that Japan
should expand into the Pacific Islands so as to
be economically independent of the United States
of America.
<p>
On 9th May 1940, Germany invaded the
Netherlands. Japan at once asked for and received
from the United States of America, Britain and France
assurances that they would preserve the status
quo of the Netherlands East Indies. Japan
gave a similar assurance. Nevertheless, by 22nd
May 1940, she had asked for and received from
Germany the statement that Germany had no interest
in the Netherlands East Indies, a statement
which was interpreted, in Japan, and as it turned
out rightly interpreted, as giving Japan a free
hand in her relations with the Netherlands East
Indies, as far as Germany was concerned.
<p>
On 17th June 1940, France asked Germany
for an armistice. on 19th June 1940, Japan renewed
her demand on French Indo-China for the
cessation of passage of supplies through Indo-China
to China and for the reception of a
Japanese Military Assistance Mission to ensure that none
went forward. These demands had been refused by
France when they were made in 1939, but the
situation of France was now very different, a
fact of which Japan was taking advantage. Now
the Governor of French Indo-China agreed, and
the Japanese Military Mission arrived in Hanoi on
29th June 1940.

<blockquote>

KOISO, then Minister of Overseas
Affairs, spoke to the German Ambassador on
24th June 1940, of Japan's colonial aspirations
in French Indo-China and the Netherlands East
Indies and inquired what Germany's attitude was
towards proposed military activity of Japan in
these territories. The Ambassador adhered to
the German declaration of disinterest in the
Netherlands East Indies already given on 22nd May
1940. He further stated that Germany would
probably raise no objections to Japanese action
in French Indo China, but she would wish Japan to
tie down the United States in the Pacific by a
threat of attack on the Philippines and Hawaii.
On 1st July 1940, Japan refused a United States
offer of an agreement to preserve the status quo
in the Pacific during the European War. The
reason for this refusal was stated in an interview
between KIDO and Arita, the Foreign Minister, as
the inadvisability at this time of having
Japan's activities, including those in the
Netherlands East Indies, restricted. There could
be no plainer admission of Japan's aggressive
intentions towards her neighbors. On 8th July
1940, Kurusu and Sato told Ribbentrop that for
nine years the object of Japan had been to build
a new China freed from the Treaty System, thus
giving the lie to repeated official declarations
of Japan made during those years. On 16th July
1940, Japan notified the Netherlands that she was
sending an economic mission to Batavia to discuss
supplies by the Netherlands East Indies to Japan.

<blockquote>

On that same day, the Yonai Cabinet resigned
under pressure from the Military and their
supporters, who thought the Cabinet too supine to
take advantage of the opportunity for Japanese
aggression in the South now presented by the
fall of France and the Netherlands and the
anxieties of Britain in Europe. The way was
clear for the accession of the Second Cabinet
of Konoye on 22nd July 1940 and for the steps it
took to further that policy of Japanese aggression
to the South.

<center>
<h3>Japanese Policy in 1940</h3>
</center>

During the Second Konoye Cabinet,
which took office on the 22nd July 1940, important
decisions were made which contributed directly
to the launching of the Pacific War on 8th
December 1941.
<p>
The negotiations with Germany leading
to the signing of the Tripartite Pact on 27th
September 1940 have been discussed in an earlier
part of the judgment. However, for a clearer
understanding of the decisions made and the
plans adopted during the Second and Third Konoye
Cabinets and the succeeding Cabinet under TOJO,
it is advisable to review briefly the policy
and plans adopted from July to October 1940.
These were a reaffirmation of the policy enunciated
by the HIROTA Cabinet on 11th August 1936,
and the practical application of that policy to
the circumstances obtaining in the latter half
of the year 1940.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--847--</i></center><hr><a name=page848></a><p>
<blockquote>

The important matters were: The
Cabinet decision of 26th July 1940, the decision
of the Four Ministers' Conference of 4th September
1940, and the Liaison Conference of 19th September
1940, the outline of Japanese foreign policy
prepared in the Foreign Office on 28th September
1940--the day after the signing of the Tripartite
Pact,--the decisions of the Cabinet meeting of
3rd October 1940, and the "Tentative Plan Towards
the Southern Regions" prepared in the Foreign
Office on 4th October 1940.
<p>
As a result of these, it was settled
by the beginning of October 1940 that the policy
of the Japanese Government was to move to the
Southern Regions with a view to the occupation
of Singapore, british Malaya, and the Dutch East
Indies, at the same time striving to avoid war
with the U.S.S.R. and the United States of America.
In the event of war breaking out with the United
States, which was considered possible, the
Philippines, Guam and other American possessions
would be included among the territories to be taken.
<p>
In somewhat more detail, the policy
aimed at the following: (1) reliance on the
Tripartite Pact; (2) conclusion of a Non-Aggression
Pact with the U.S.S.R.; (3) successful
conclusion of the war in China: (4) incorporation
of French Indo-China, the Netherlands
East Indies, the Straits Settlements, British
Malaya, Thailand, the Philippines, British
Borneo and Burma into the Greater East

<blockquote>

Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (which hereafter for
shortness we will refer to as the "Co-Prosperity
Sphere"); (5) to offer to mediate for settlement
of the European War and in return obtain from
Great Britain recognition of the Co-Prosperity
Sphere; (6) conclusion of a Non-Aggression Pact
with the United States, whereby the United States
would recognize the Co-Prosperity Sphere in
return for Japanese respect for the independence
of the Philippines.
<p>
On the 4th October 1940, Konoye made a
statement to the Press in which he said that if
the United States refused to understand the real
intentions of Japan, Germany and Italy and continued
its challenging attitude and acts, both
the United States and Great Britain would be
forced into war with Japan, meaning that Japan
would be compelled to go to war with them. He
explained that Japan was maneuvering, diplomatically
to induce the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and
the United States to suspend aid to China.
<p>
By this time, the aggressive intentions
of Japan had become so evident that the United
States of America was not prepared to continue
to supply Japan with the raw materials to manufacture
munitions of war which would be used to
realize these aggressive aims. A Presidential
Proclamation was issued extending to all iron
and steel scrap, except to the Western Hemisphere
and Great Britain, the embargoes imposed in
1938 and 1939 in protest against Japan's disregard
of treaties. It should be noted that the

<p><center><i>--849--</i></center><hr><a name=page850></a><p>
<blockquote>

United States of America had, on 26th January
1940, terminated its Commercial Treaty with
Japan. The embargo was extended and placed
under a licensing system on 10th December 1940.
Copper, brass, zinc, bronze, nickel, and potash
were added to the embargo list on 3rd February
1941. Scrap rubber was added on 5th May 1941.
By 20th June 1941, the situation had so deteriorated
that all petroleum exports from the United
States were banned, except to Great Britain and
South America.
<p>
Measures were adopted to counteract
the American embargoes by strengthening the
national economy of Japan and by organizing
Japan-Manchukuo-China as an economic bloc.
The Cabinet decided that tit was necessary to
allot to each of the three countries within the
bloc well defined spheres of activity in labor,
finance, exchange, manufacturing, communications,
transportation, etc., in order to avoid economic
rivalry, dual investments, and duplication of enterprises.

<center>
<h3>Measures to Implement Policy</h3>
</center>

In a policy study of 25th October 1940,
the Konoye Cabinet decided to recognize the
puppet Central Government of China led by Wang
Ching-Wei and to negotiate a basic treaty with
that government for adjustment of relations between
it and the Government of Japan. The Treaty was
signed on 30th November; and the new Ambassador
to the puppet government was instructed that

<p><center><i>--850--</i></center><hr><a name=page851></a><p>
<blockquote>

since the Cabinet had adopted the puppet Central
Government as an instrument for long term warfare,
he should bear that point in mind and
cooperate to the fullest extent with the Army
and Navy.
<p>
HOSHINO, as President of the Planning
Board and formerly Director of the General Affairs
Board of Manchukuo, was actively directing the
negotiation of a joint declaration to be made by
Japan, Manchukuo and China upon the occasion of
the signing of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty.
KIMURA was appointed to the Japan-Manchukuo
Joint Economic Committee on 7th November 1949.
The Japan-Manchukuo-China Joint Declaration was
initialed in final form on 8th November and
published on 30th November 1940 at the time the
signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty was announced.
This joint declaration stated that the three
countries would cooperate on a military and
economic basis and take all necessary measures
to establish the New Order in Asia.
<p>
HOSHINO has explained the reorganization
of the Japanese economy to bring it in line
with the new economic bloc. He stated that in
November the Cabinet decided upon a plan to
group companies of each industry into associations
in order to control those companies
through the heads of the associations, who were
to be appointed by the Cabinet and placed under
the supervision of the Minister of Commerce and
industry. He said that laws and ordinances were
issued to place the plan into effect and that

<p><center><i>--851--</i></center><hr><a name=page852></a><p>
<blockquote>

there was little revision of the plan thereafter.
As a result of that plan, no less that 212 major
corporation mergers took place in 1940 involving
capital amounting to 2,300,000,000 yen; and
during the dirst half of 1941, there were 172
major mergers involving over 3,000,000,000 yen.
<p>
The Privy Councillors had indicated
during the deliberation upon the Tripartite Pact

a number of measures that should be taken to
prepare Japan for the war which they expected
to follow the signing of the Tripartite Pact.
Immediately after the Privy Council meeting,
HOSHINO began to take measures to strengthen
Japan's financial structure. On 19th October
1940, an Imperial Ordinance entitled "Ordinance
Concerning Operation of Funds of Banks and
Other Financial Institutions" was promulgated
to add to government control over finances by
requiring all financial institutions to adjust
their investment policies according to government
directives and providing for compensating of
losses incurred by financial institutions as a
result of government directives. On the same
day, the Imperial Ordinance for Control of
Corporate Accounts was promulgated, by which
institutions were required to conserve funds
for attainment of the object of the National
General Mobilization Law.

Councillors concern at the meeting of 26th

<blockquote>

September 1940, during the discussion of the
Tripartite Pact, was the reaction to be expected
from the Japanese people to the hardships to
which they were being subjected and which would
be increased as a result of the signing of the
Pact because of economic sanctions the United
States was expected to impose. Konoye's answer
to that problem was the organization of the
imperial Rule Assistance Association on 10th
October 1940. KIDO and Konoye had discussed
the organization of a great all-embracing
political party in May 1940a, before the fall of
the Yonai Cabinet, but had deferred action.
HASHIMOTO brought to the Preparatory Committee
of the Association his long experience in the
organization of political associations; and
HOSHINO assisted as a member of the Committee.
The Articles of Association were drawn in
detail with the obvious intention that the
Association should spread over Japan into every
district, county, city and even into every home.
The Association was designed to turn Japan into
a one party state on the lines of totalitarian
states in Europe. Other political parties
would be abolished. The Premier was to be at
the head of the Association and the leader of
the one party. Its purpose was presented
euphemistically as being to establish a spiritually
and physically the national structure
to aid the Emperor in realizing the aims of <i>Hakko
Ichiu</i> and making Japan the leader of a glorious world.

<h3>Hashimoto and Shiratori Appeal for Public Support of War Policy</h3>
</center>

A number of organizations were
affiliated with the Imperial Rule Assistance
Association. HASHIMOTO was a member of the
Board of Directors of the Association. He
organized the <i>Sekiseikai,</i> an ultra nationalist
society. On 7th November 1940, while on an
organizing tour, he issued his command to that
society as follows: "Rise up resolutely, time
approaches. Instigate at once a powerful
national movement, using every kind of method,
speeches, meetings, posters, etc., and begin
a sweeping campaign against sympathizers of
England and America and at the same time start
a movement ot inspire moral support of the
Advance Southward." He delivered an address
to a meeting of the society at Kyoto attended
by more than 5,000 persons on

2nd January 1941. In that speech, HASHIMOTO advocated the
overthrow of England and America, as he had done in his
popular speech "Praying to Soldiers". Here again, he
advocated a "Southward Advance".
<p>
HASHIMOTO was engaged in writing during this period.
He published his "Inevitability of Renovation" on 20th
December 1940; and on 30th January 1941, he published his
"Road to the Reconstruction of the World" and issued the
14th edition of his "Second Creation". In his "Inevitability
of Renovation", after mentioning that the end of
the year was approaching and that it was time to "ring a
loud alarm bell", he advised that it was time to attack
Great Britain while she was engaged in war with Germany and
Italy in order ot eliminate her opposition to the establishment
of the New Order in Asia and the Pacific Region, and
that the defeat of Great Britain should be followed by an
attack upon the United States. His "Second Creation" contained
the "Declaration of HASHIMOTO Kingoro". That declaration
was to the effect that the world was facing an historic
turning point, and that Japan, whose national policy was
<i>Hakko Ichiu,</i> should take a bold leap and immediately
display her original character by following the Emperor
blindly with all the Nation's capacity in order to become
the glorious leader of the World. He stated that war
preparations should be completed to enable Japan to crush
Great Britain and the United States, who were interfering
with Japan's expansion upon the Continent of Asia and her
advance to the south. In his "Road to the Reconstruction
of the World", HASHIMOTO displayed his support of totalitarian
government and admiration of the methods of dictators
and admitted having taken part in the Manchuria Incident.

February incidents and other plots in Japan.
<p>
SHIRATORI had retained his position as ambassador
to Italy until 28th August 1940, when he became a Diplomatic
Councillor in the Foreign Office and assisted in the reorganization
of the Government along totalitarian lines and in the
purge from the Foreign Service of those thought to have Anglo-Saxon
sympathies. During this period, he lectured and wrote
extensively in support of the proposed Tripartite Pact. In
november 1940, he collected a number of his lectures and
magazine articles and published them in one volume for distribution
in support of the Pact. He declared in his
"European War and the Attitude of Japan", which had been
published in November 1939, that the European War could be
developed to aid Japan in the establishment of its aims in
the Far East. He stated in his "Necessity of the Japan-Germany-Italy
Alliance" of December 1939 that the aim of
Germany and Italy was to divide the world into a comparatively
few groups of States with each group dominated by
one member State, and that Japan should join Germany and
Italy in their endeavor in order to establish the New
Order in Asia, <i>i.e.</i> the domination of East Asia. In his
"Trend of the Great War" of June 1940, he said that Japan
was actually involved in the war because the fuse of the
European War was first attached by the China War; and he
asked significantly whether the enemies of Germany and Italy
who were opposing the establishment of the New Order in
Europe were not the enemies of Japan. He advised, in his
"Comment on Japan's Non-interference" of June 1940, that
since Japan had been assuming the leading role in establishing
the New Order ever since the beginning of the Manchurian
Incident, she should give early assistance to the Axis Powers,
who were attempting to destroy the Old Order based upon democratic

<p><center><i>--856--</i></center><hr><a name=page857></a><p>
<blockquote>

capitalism and establish the New Order based on totalitarian
principles. He advised that this assistance should
take the form of containing the American Fleet in the Pacific
and suggested as Japan's possible reward the Netherlands East
Indies and British colonies in the Far East and the Pacific.
<p>
SHIRATORI continued his writings after the Tripartite
Pact was signed. He stated in his "Conclusion of
Japan-Germany-Italy Alliance" of 29th September 1940 that
historians of the future generations would probably refer to
the Pact as the "Treaty of the New World Order", as it not
only represented a racial feud between the Anglo-Saxon and
the Teuton and between the Yellow and White Races, but it
included a positive programme to overthrow the status quo
and prescribe the New World. He declared in his "Three Power
Pact and the World of Tomorrow", published in December 1940,
that the totalitarian movement was spreading over the world
like a prairie fire, leaving no room in the World of Tomorrow
for any other concept of world and man. He said that Japan
had maintained a pure and unadulterated totalitarian government
during her entire existence which embodied the principle
of the unity of the sovereign and subjects of one organic
body as the immutable faith of the Japanese people. He said
that the Manchurian Incident was a bursting forth of this
healthy instinct of the nation, which had been hitherto suppressed
by conditions long imposed by the democratic powers.
He called for reexamination and a return to the true spirit
of <i>Hakko Ichiu.</i> He pointed to the China War as essentially
a conflict between Japan and the democratic powers, and declared
that the wars in the East and in the West were in
fact one war.

<h3>Total War Research Institute</h3>
</center>

A Privy Councillor had inquired during the
deliberations upon the Tripartite Pact about preparations
to meet the situation in case of war. The
National Policy Investigation Association,
or <i>Kokusaku-Kenkyu-Kai</i>
had existed since 1936 as an investigating
and advisory body to assist the Government in the
solution of the graver political problems; but its
principal value was that it served as a medium to bind
the Zaibatsu to the Military. The Total War Research
Institute was organized as an official government
board or commission by Imperial Ordinance on 30th
September 1940. The Ordinance provided that the
Institute should be under the Prime Minister and control
basic study and research in connection with
national total war as well as with the education and
training of officials and others to wage total war.
HOSHINO became the Acting Director of the Institute
on 1st October; and he was followed by high-ranking
Generals and Admirals, who continued the work of the
institute until April 1945. SUZUKI was one of the
Councillors of the Institute. Each Ministry of the
Government was represented in the Institute. Many
Boards and Bureaux of the Government, as well as the
Government of Formosa, the South Manchurian Railway,
the Zaibatsu Companies, and the Yokohama Specie Bank
were also represented on the staff of the Institute.
Students were selected from every branch and department
of the country's activities. Lectures were
delivered, studies or exercises were conducted.
The Institute compiled research reports on important
subjects which were useful in planning total war.

it was adopted by the Cabinet with Home Minister HIRANUMA
and War Minister TOJO warmly supporting the measure. The
plan was to make payments to young married people to encourage
early marriages, reduce the marriage age, ban birth
control, give priority on materials to prolific families
and establish special bureaux to encourage a high birth
rate. The purpose was to increase the population so as to
insure the leadership of Japan over East Asia, and furnish
manpower for labour and military service in the development
of Japan's plan in East Asia. The goal set was a population
for Japan of 100,000,000 by 1950. The plan was put into
effect by appropriate ordinances and decrees.

<h3>Cooperation Under Tripartite Pact</h3>
</center>

Active cooperation with Germany and Italy under
the Pact began shortly after it was signed. OSHIMA wrote
in a newspaper article published on 27th October 1940, that
one could not fail to be deeply stirred by the fact that
the Pact had been concluded and that Japan's objective of
founding a New World Order had been made clear, but that the
nation with unswerving resolution should make preparations
for the attainment of that objective without delay. he
advised that mutual economic and military cooperation with
Germany and Italy should be perfected speedily so that no
opportunities to establish the New Order in Greater East
Asia and the South Seas would be lost.
<p>
The three Signatories of the Pact agreed on 20th
December 1940 to form the Commissions provided for by the
Pact. The Agreement called for the establishment of a
General Commission and two Technical Commissions, military
and economic, to be formed independently of each other in
each of the three capitals. MUTO, as Chief of the Military

<p><center><i>--860--</i></center><hr><a name=page861></a><p>
<blockquote>

Affairs Bureau, and OKA, who had become Chief of the
Naval Affairs Bureau of the Navy Ministry, were
appointed to the Technical Military Commission in Tokyo.
<p>
OSHIMA was appointed Ambassador to Germany
on the day the agreement was reached, and became a
member of the General Commission in Berlin. The
Army and Navy had urged OSHIMA's appointment as
Ambassador because he was recognized as a strong supporter
of the Pact and his appointment would promote
cooperation with Germany and Italy. Matsuoka, in a
speech delivered on 15th January on the occasion of
OSHIMA's departure for Germany, stated that he was
most delighted that OSHIMA was returning as Ambassador
to Germany as he had built up such a personal credit
among the German leaders that he could talk to them
without reserve, and that practical use of the Pact
would largely depend upon OSHIMA's ability.
<p>
Matsuoka planned a visit to Germany after
OSHIMA's arrival there. His purpose was to promote
cooperation under the Pact, to secure German assistance
in settlement of the China War and to negotiate
a Non-Aggression Pact with the U.S.S.R., as contemplated
by the Pact, for the purpose of neutralizing
the U.S.S.R. during the advance to the South. The
mediation of the border dispute between French Indo-China
and Thailand, which we will mention presently,
delayed Matsuoka's departure for Germany, He arrived
in Berlin in March 1941, and after holding conversations
with Ribbentrop and Hitler, proceeded to Moscow,
where he concluded the Soviet-Japanese Non-Aggression
Pact of 13th April 1941. Ratifications of that Pact

were exchanged in Tokyo on 20th May 1941. As we have
indicated, and as we have discussed elsewhere, this
Pact did not mean that Japan had abandoned its aims
of aggrandisement at the expense of the Soviet.
The Pact was dictated by expediency. It was a matter
of timing.

<h3>Preparations for Move to the South</h3>
</center>

One of the principal elements of the policy
adopted by the Cabinet in September and October 1940,
was the establishment of an economic bloc of Japan,
Manchukuo and China in order to accelerate the
establishment of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
It was decided that the first stage of development of
the Co-Prosperity Sphere should be a penetration
into the whole area west of Hawaii, including French
Indo-China, the Netherlands East Indies, British Burma,
and the Straits Settlements, excluding for the time the
Philippines and Guam. A complete strategical plan was
formulated. An attempt was to be made to effect a
settlement with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and to
employ his troops, rewarding China by allowing her to
annex Tonkin Province of French Indo-China and Northern
Burma. It was planned to conclude protective treaties
with french Indo-China and Thailand under the guise of
military and economic alliances in order to secure
bases in those countries for an advance on Singapore.
Thailand was to be promised part of French Indo-China
as her reward. However, in order to delay Thailand in
making preparations to resist invasion by Japan, it was
planned to pretend that Japanese-Thailand relations were
secure until Japan was ready to start military action. To
avoid destruction of the oil wells and other resources
in the Islands of the Netherlands Indies, it was
decided to capture Singapore before beginning operations
against the Netherlands East Indies, and to call
upon the inhabitants during the seige of Singapore to
declare their independence, seize the oil wells and

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--864--</i></center><hr><a name=page865></a><p>
<blockquote>

hand them over intact to the Japanese. Independence
movements were to be used in French Indo-China, Burma
and Malaya to assist penetration in those areas.
Military action was to begin upon settlement with
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, or upon Germany's invasion
of England, whichever occurred first; and in
the event that neither occurred, the action was to
commence when Germany had achieved some substantial
military success. Action was to be coordinated with
Germany military plans.
<p>
During November 1940, the Konoye Cabinet began
to make advances to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek for
settlement of the China War. MATSUOKA continued his
overtures to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and expected
favourable progress as a result of conversations to be
held by him in Berlin. The recognition by Japan of the
puppet Central Government of China, however, had
destroyed any possibility of reaching an agreement
with the Generalissimo.

<center>
<h3>Thailand's Claims</h3>
</center>

With the outbreak of war in Europe, thailand
had presented demands to French Indo-China for the
return to Thailand of territory lost to Indo-China in
the year 1904. On 12th June 1940, a Non-Aggression
Pact was signed between French Indo-China and Thailand.
One of the terms provided for the appointment of a commission
to settle the matter of the disputed border.
When France sued for an armistice with Germany on 17th
June 1940, Thailand demanded the revision of the border
in accordance with her wishes as a condition of ratifying
the Non-Aggression Pact of 12th June 1940.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--865--</i></center><hr><a name=page866></a><p>
<blockquote>

On 30th August 1940, there was concluded
between Japan and France the so-called Matsuoka-Henri
Agreement, by which France agreed to the
entry of Japanese troops into Northern Indo-China.
A note was sent by Thailand to the French Indo-China
authorities on 28th September 1940, repeating
her demands and proposing the Mekong River as the
boundary between Thailand and French Indo-China. The
Note stated that Thailand would not press her claims
to territory in Laos and Cambodia unless and until
such time as France renounced her sovereignty over
French Indo-China. On 11th October, the French rejected
these demands. Thailand then began to concentration
of troops along the border, and France
countered by a like concentration. It appeared that
hostilities would commence soon, but Japan limited
her occupation of French Indo-China to the Northern
part of that territory, and Thailand, left without
Japanese support, stayed her hand.
<p>
In late October 1940, Thailand sent a
delegation to Japan to learn the Konoye Cabinet's
intentions regarding the border dispute between
Thailand and French Indo-China. The Japanese plans
formulated in September and October 1940 contained a
suggestion that a secret committee should be formed
under the Japanese Thailand Non-Aggression Pact to
make preparations for a military alliance between
Japan and Thailand, to be signed as soon as Japan
should begin the military action against Singapore.
Accordingly, it was decided at the Four Ministers'
Conferences of 5th and 21st November 1940 to assist
Thailand in her negotiations with French Indo-China
and force French Indo-China to accept THailand's demands
by returning the territory on the west side of
the Mekong River across from Luangprabang and Bakuse to

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--866--</i></center><hr><a name=page867></a><p>
<blockquote>

Thailand, provided Thailand would accept the
Japanese demands. Prime Minister Pibun of
Thailand accepted the Japanese demands. In
this way, Japan prejudged the issue of a dispute
in which she subsequently insisted in acting
as arbitrator.
<p>
Following the Four Ministers' Conference
of 21 November 1940, Matsuoka informed
the German Ambassador that he had proposed
to Thailand that if she limited her territorial
claims, the Konoye Cabinet would be
willing to mediate between Thailand and French
Indo-China. He told the Ambassador that if
the need should arise, Japan would request the
support of the German Government in dealing
with the Vichy French Government. He said also
that a cruiser was to be despatched to Saigon
as a demonstration against French Indo-China
to force her to agree to the Japanese demands.
This cruiser was scheduled to arrive in Saigon
about the middle of December.
<p>
The Prime Minister of Thailand, having
agreed to the Japanese terms for so-called
"mediation" of the dispute, Thailand resumed
military action against French Indo-China; and
on 28th November 1940, an engagement was fought
between Thailand and French troops. Taking
advantage of this action, Matsuoka informed
the French Ambassador that he would act as an
arbitrator regarding Thailand's demands for
recovery of territory ceded to France in 1904.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--867--</i></center><hr><a name=page868></a><p>
<blockquote>

The Ambassador replied the next day that the
Vichy French Government appreciated the offer
of arbitration, but that it expected its territorial
integrity in French Indo-China to
be respected.

<center>
<h3>French Indo-China and Thailand to be Used<br>for Attack on Singapore</h3>
</center>

On 23rd January 1941, Kurusu, the
Japanese Ambassador in Berlin, explained to
Weizsacker that an advance southward against
Singapore was unthinkable without using the
land bridge of the Malay Peninsula after
crossing French Indo-China and Thailand territory.
For that reason, Britain should be
prevented from interfering with Japanese arrangements
with Thailand. A group led by
Diplomatic Councillor SHIRATORI was demanding
an immediate attack upon Singapore, which they
considered the key position in the Pacific Area.
As a consequence, the Japanese military authorities
and the German Military Attach&eacutes; in
Tokyo in January 1941, made a study of the possibilities
of such an attack. The conclusion
reached was that the attack should be carried
out in phases by occupying Saigon, and then
landing on the Malay Peninsula.
<p>
The Liaison Conference of 30th January
1941 decided to utilize the mediation of the
border dispute between French Indo-China and
Thailand to establish Japan's position in those
countries and to obtain naval bases on Camranh

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--868--</i></center><hr><a name=page869></a><p>
<blockquote>

Bay as well as air bases in the vicinity of
Saigon to be used for the attack upon Singapore.
The steps taken to give effect to this decision
will be dealt with later. The true purpose of
the mediation was to be concealed, it was
decided, and the negotiations were to be
described as an attempt to maintain the peace
between the disputing parties. After the
Liaison Conference, Konoye and the Chiefs of
the Army and Navy General Staffs informed the
Emperor of the decision of the Conference and
secured his approval. KIDO, who was aware of
the decision, recorded in his diary that this
procedure of by-passing the Imperial Conference
was unusual.
<p>
Germany prevented the Vichy French
Government from sending reinforcements to French
Indo-China, and French Indo-China was forced to
sign an armistice with Thailand on 31st January
1941. Under the terms of the armistice, the
troops of both countries were to retreat from
the lines held on 28th January, and all military
action was to cease. Japanese were to supervise
the observance of the armistice, which was to
continue until a permanent peace treaty could
be agreed upon. SATO, who had been on temporary
duty with the South China Expeditionary Forces
during the first invasion of French Indo-China
in September and October 1940, was one of Japan's
representatives in the supervision of this
armistice. He did not return to his duties in

<p><center><i>--869--</i></center><hr><a name=page870></a><p>
<blockquote>

the Military Affairs Bureau until March, when
an agreement had been reached between Japan
and Vichy France for settlement of the dispute
and France had agreed to all of Japan's demands.
<p>
The armistice having been signed,
preparations for the mediation proceeded. The
Japanese Mediation Commission was appointed on
5th and 6th February 1941, with Matsuoka, MUTO
and OKA among its members. The negotiations
were to begin on 7th February; and on 6th
February, Matsuoka informed the German Ambassador
that his Cabinet intended to use the mediation
to force both France and Thailand to agree to
make no political or military agreement with
any third power, and requested that the German
Government be so notified.
<p>
The results of this mediation of
Japan in the dispute between Thailand and
French Indo-China were seen when the peace
treaty between Vichy France and Thailand was
finally signed on 9th May 1941. The Treaty
provided for the cession by France to Thailand
of territory and for the establishment of the
border along the centre of the Mekong river,
all as claimed by Thailand. We have previously
seen that this result had been determined at
the Japanese Four Ministers' Conferences of 5th
and 21st November 1940.

<p><center><i>--870--</i></center><hr><a name=page871></a><p>
<blockquote>

1941 established a precedent which was customarily
followed until the end of the Pacific War.
Important decisions were made at Liaison Conferences,
and reported directly to the Emperor
for his approval. Thereafter, Imperial Conferences
were held only on the most important
questions, such as decisions to declare war.
The Liaison Conference therefore latterly became
the real policy-determining body of the Empire.
Members of the Conference were the Prime Minister,
Foreign Minister, Army Minister, Navy Minister,
Home Minister, Chiefs of the Army and Navy General
Staffs and their Vice-Chiefs, the Chiefs of the
Military Affairs Bureau and Naval Affairs Bureau,
President of the Planning Board and the Chief
Secretary of the Cabinet. In the Second Konoye
Cabinet, TOJO, HIRANUMA, HOSHINO,
MUTO, SUZUKI after his appointment as President
of the Planning Board, and OKA after his appointment
as Chief of the Naval Affairs Bureau,
regularly attended these Conferences and participated
in the formation and execution of government policies.

<h3>Diplomatic Discussions</h3>
</center>

In February 1941, British Foreign
Minister Anthony Eden summoned Ambassador
SHIGEMITSU for a conference on the situation.
He referred to reports that the situation in
the Far East was extremely strained, and
expressed disapproval of Matsuoka's statements

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--871--</i></center><hr><a name=page872></a><p>
<blockquote>

and contentions that only Japan had the right
to mediate in conflicts in the Far East. He
condemned the fraudulent nature of the mediation
then being conducted between France and Thailand.
He declared Britain's intention to defend her
territories in the Far East. SHIGEMITSU replied
that he was not aware of any strained situation.
The evidence shows, however, that he was not
only aware of the critical situation but was
also thoroughly familiar with the plans adopted
by the Konoye Cabinet and the action which had
been taken up to that date to carry them into
effect. He said that he interpreted Mr. Eden's
remarks as a clear statement of the British
position based on the premise that British-Japanese
relations were near the breaking point;
and after complaining of British-American
cooperation, he stated that he would make a
complete report to his Government and request instructions.
<p>
Matsuoka saw in this conference between
Mr. Eden and SHIGEMITSU an opportunity to carry
out the fifth provision of the plan adopted in
September and October 1940, which was that at
an appropriate time Japan should attempt to
mediate so that Britain would make peace with
Germany, and to use that mediation to obtain from
Britain recognition of Japan's domination of
South East Asia and the adjacent parts of the
Pacific. The plan was that Japan, in return for
that recognition, would promise the preservation

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--872--</i></center><hr><a name=page873></a><p>
<blockquote>

of the British Empire, including Australia and
New Zealand, and would promise general economic
cooperation with Britain. Matsuoka was conducting
the mediation between France and
Thailand; and on 10th february 1941, he informed
the German Ambassador that an attack upon
Singapore was being prepared. However, on 13th
February, he cabled SHIGEMITSU to inform Mr. Eden
that the British Ambassador's report of an
impending crisis in the Far East was a ridiculous fantasy.
<p>
Matsuoka told SHIGEMITSU that the
report of the British Ambassador seemed to have
been made upon the assumption that Japan would
acquire military bases in French Indo-China and
Thailand and then commence action against Britain
in the South Seas concurrently with Germany;s
invasion of England. He said it was difficult
to understand on what ground the Ambassador in
Tokyo had based the alarming report as he,
Matsuoka, he privately investigated and had
been unable to find any basis for the report.
Notwithstanding Matsuoka's denial, the substance
of the British Ambassador's report was in fact
what had been decided by the Liaison Conference
of 30th January 1941 at which Matsuoka was
present. Matsuoka instructed SHIGEMITSU to say
to Mr. eden that there was no basis for the Press
reports that Japan was planning to start military
action at any moment as there was nothing that
Japan could gain by such action.

<p><center><i>--873--</i></center><hr><a name=page874></a><p>
<blockquote>

Matsuoka saw the British Ambassador
in Tokyo on 15th February 1941, and, after
attempting to learn the source of the Ambassador's
information regarding the impending crisis in
the Far East, assured him that so long as Britain
and the United States refrained from taking provocative
action, Japan would under no circumstances
initiate action which should cause anxiety on the
part of those Powers.
<b>[</b>Singapore surrendered to Japanese forces on this
date exactly one year later. --<i>HyperWar</i><b>]</b>
The Ambassador enquired whether Matsuoka would check the southward
advance and asked whether Japan expected exhorbitant
compensation for her role as mediator of
the French-Thailand dispute. Matsuoka replied
that he would try to check the southward advance
to the best of his ability, and assured the
Ambassador that Japan's purpose in mediating
the dispute was solely to restore peace between
French Indo-China and Thailand.
<p>
Matsuoka, on 20th February 1942,
complained to the British Ambassador regarding
the reinforcement of the British garrison in
Malaya. Matsuoka complained also to the American
Ambassador that Britain was taking offensive
action in reinforcing the garrison in Malaya.
The American Ambassador replied that it seemed
to him extraordinary that Japan should interpret
and characterize an obviously defensive measure
as an offensive one. He then mentioned the
occupation by Japan in succession of Weichow,
Hainan Island and the Spratley Islands, as well
as the concentration of troops in French Indo-China,
and the public declarations of intention

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--874--</i></center><hr><a name=page875></a><p>

to advance to the South. He observed that the
facts could hardly be interpreted by either
Great Britain or the United States as indicating
peaceful intentions on the part of Japan.
<p>
Matsuoka address a Note to Mr. Eden
on 17th February 1941. He denied the report of an

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--875--</i></center><hr><a name=page876></a><p>
<blockquote>

impending crisis in the Far East. He claimed that
the primary purpose of the Tripartite Pact was to
limit the sphere of the European War by preventing
third Powers from becoming engaged, and thereby to
bring the war to an early termination. He assured
the British Government that this was the sole object
of the Pact, which constituted the fundamental basis
of Japanese foreign policy. He submitted that he
could not but be anxious because of the British and
American Governments' attempt to prepare for supposed
contingencies in the Pacific Ocean and in the South
Seas, and observed that if the United States would
restrict its activities to the Western Hemisphere,
the situation would indeed be very much mitigated.
He then stated that the uppermost thought in his mind
had always been world peace, and that he sincerely
hoped for an early termination of the China and
European Wars. He suggested that Japan act as mediator
for the settlement of the European War.
<p>
The British Government replied to Matsuoka's
offer of mediation of 24th February 1941. After assuring
the Japanese Government that the preparations by
Great Britain and the United States in the Pacific
Ocean and the South Seas were purely defensive, and
that they intended to take no offensive action
against Japan, the British Government rejected the
offer for mediation of the European War. The British
Government stated that it had made every effort to
avert the hostilities in Europe before their commencement;
but having been forced into the hostilities, it
had no thought but to carry them to a victorious conclusion.
<p>
Mr. Churchill had a conversation with

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--876--</i></center><hr><a name=page877></a><p>
<blockquote>

SHIGEMITSU on the day this reply was despatched to
the Japanese Government in which he emphasized
Britain's determination to continue the war. He
expressed regret that Anglo-Japanese relations,
which had been friendly from the time of the conclusion
of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, should be
getting worse. He said it would be a tragedy if a
clash should occur between the two Nations, that
the defensive works under construction around
Singapore were merely for protection, expressed
his confidence in victory in the European War,
and said that the question of mediation of that war
as mentioned by Matsuoka would not arise. SHIGEMITSU
denied that Matsuoka had suggested mediation and
stated that Matsuoka had only intended to emphasize
Japan's spirit toward peace. He expressed regret
that Britain had been giving aid to the Chungking
Government in its resistance to Japan.
<p>
Matsuoka, in a communication addressed to
Mr. Churchill on 27th February 1941, reaffirmed his
explanation of Japan's intentions under the Tripartite
Pact, and again assured Britain that Japan had no
intentions of attacking her. He professed surprise
that his Note to Mr. Eden of 17th February had been
interpreted as an offer of mediation, but hinted that
he was not adverse to the idea.

<center>
<h3>Preparation for the Attack Upon Singapore</h3>
</center>

The failure of the attempt to destroy
British-American cooperation and gain British acceptance
of their penetration into South East Asia
through mediation in the European War made it

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--877--</i></center><hr><a name=page878></a><p>
<blockquote>

necessary for the Japanese leaders to pursue their
alternative plan to use force to accomplish the same end
by an attack upon Singapore. Preparations for the
attack proceeded at a rapid rate. Aerial photography
was undertaken in January 1941 to collect data for the
landing operations at Kota Bharu. Additional mapping
of that area was completed by the Japanese Hydrographic
Office in July 1941. The maps were completed and
printed by the Naval General Staff in early October 1941.
<p>
The War Ministry, in conjunction with the
Finance Ministry, as early as January 1941, commenced preparing
military currency for use in the areas which they
expected the Japanese troops to occupy in the advance to
the South. Special currencies were printed and deposited
with the Bank of Japan to be drawn by the Army as it
occupied enemy territories. The military currency thus
prepared consisted of dollars which were suitable for
use in Malaya, Borneo and Thailand; guilders for use in
the Netherlands East Indies; and pesos for the Philippines.
In January 19841, therefore, both the War Ministry
and the Finance Ministry contemplated Japanese armies
occupying those territories for which this currency
was prepared.
<p>
The Total War Research Institute early in 1941
compiled research reports on such subjects as "The Estimate
of the domestic and Foreign Situation from the Total
War Viewpoint", "Study of Total War Pertaining to the
National Strength of Imperial Japan and the Foreign Powers",
"Draft of the Plan for the Establishment of Greater
East Asia", and "First Phase in the Total War Plan".
<p>
OSHIMA returned to Berlin to take up his duties
again as Ambassador to Germany. He informed Weizsacker
of the German Foreign Office on 22nd February 1941 that

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--878--</i></center><hr><a name=page879></a><p>
<blockquote>

Singapore would have to be seized by an attack from the
sea and from the land; and on 27th February, he told Ribbentrop
that preparations for the attack upon Singapore
would be completed by the end of May; he added that the
occupation of Hong Kong and the Philippines had been provided
for in case of need. On 28th March 1941, Ribbentrop
told Matsuoka that the capture of Singapore was essential
and that the Philippines could be occupied at the same
time. Matsuoka agreed with Ribbentrop and felt that if
Japan did not take the risk of conquering Singapore, she
would become a third-rate power.

<center>
<h3>Further Preparations</h3>
</center>

The Japanese Imperial Headquarters continued
its preparations for the attack upon Singapore during
Matsuoka's visit to Germany. The Chiefs of the Army and
Navy General Staffs informed the German Ambassador late
in March 1941 that they were vigorously preparing for the
attack upon Singapore. SHIRATORI discussed with the German
Ambassador the strategy for the attack; it was his opinion
that a frontal attack by the Navy should not be made, but
that bases should be established on the Malay Peninsula
from which the Japanese Air Force, aided by German dive
bombers, might bomb Singapore in preparation for the attack
down the peninsula. Matsuoka, in a conference with Field
Marshal Goering on 29th March 1941, made arrangements for
assistance from the German Air Force in return for an increase
in the amount of rubber to be supplied to Germany by Japan.
<p>
Economic measures for war were being accelerated
in Japan. An important question was oil, as the United
States was increasing its embargo and the negotiations
with the Netherlands East Indies at Batavia were making

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--879--</i></center><hr><a name=page880></a><p>
<blockquote>

no progress. HOSHINO, of the Planning Board, estimated
that the Army and Navy had sufficient oil in storage
until the oil in the Netherlands East Indies could be
seized. He, however, believed that the maring was
narrow, as Japan's production was only 300,000 tons and
her annual consumption was 2,000,000 tons. This fact
made careful planning necessary for the capture of the
oil resources of the Netherlands East Indies intact.
this need for careful planning caused the Imperial
Headquarters to suggest to Konoye in April 1941 that
HOSHINO be replaced by SUZUKI,a soldier, in whom the
Army and Navy had complete confidence. Konoye discussed
the matter with KIDO, and on the 4th April, HOSHINO was
appointed a member of the House of Peers and SUZUKI
was appointed President of the Planning Board and Minister
without Portfolio.
<p>
The leaders of Japan now decided to strengthen
the close relationship among Japan, French Indo-China,
and Thailand, to continue economic negotiations with the
Netherlands at Batavia, and to maintain normal economic
relations with other countries; but, in case they should
conclude that the Empire's self-existence was threatened
by the embargoes of the United States, Great Britain
and the Netherlands, to resort to arms immediately to
prevent consumption of Japan's reserve of vital war
materials. KIMURA was appointed Vice-Minister of War
on 10 April, and nine days later he became Director of
War Supplies. These appointments necessitated his relief
from the Japan-Manchukuo Join Economic Commission.
<p>
Military topographical data was being assembled
for military operations in various part of

<p><center><i>--880--</i></center><hr><a name=page881></a><p>
<blockquote>

the world. Espionage activities in the Netherlands
East Indies were being carried out increasingly.
Operations were being planned against Java, Sumatra,
Bali and other places as well as Singapore. Mandated
Islands were being fortified and plans were being completed
for operations in the South Seas. Data were
being assembled for use in Burma and Malaya. The
work of printing military script for use in the
occupation of southern areas continued.
<p>
Matsuoka, in conference with Hitler on
4th April 1941, requested Hitler to furnish Japan,
through the Technical Military Commission established
under the Tripartite Pact, with all available information,
including the latest technical improvements and inventions
relating to submarine warfare. He explained
that the Japanese Navy would need this information
in case it should decide to attack Singapore. Matsuoka
added that sooner or later war with the United States
would be unavoidable and Japan desired to be ready to
strike decisively at the right moment. But Matsuoka
cautioned Hitler not to mention in any cab les to Japan
that an attack upon Singapore had been agreed upon,
lest the secret leak out. Ambassador OSHIMA took part
in Matsuoka's conferences in Berlin relating to assistance
in the plans for the attack upon Singapore.

<center>
<h3>Neutrality Pact -- Japan-U.S.S.R.</h3>
</center>

An important question was th time for the
attack upon Singapore. The Germans urged its immediate

beginning, which Matsuoka had helped to form at a
Conference on 19th July 1940, had contemplated a

Non-Aggression Pact with the U.S.S.R. to protect the
Japanese rear during the attack upon Singapore and the
Netherlands East Indies. Hitler insisted in his conversation
with Matsuoka on 27th March 1941, with OSHIMA and
other present, that a better opportunity to begin the
attack than the present would never occur again. Matsuoka
replied that it was only a matter of time before Japan
would attack, as the Japanese had the feeling that otherwise
she would lose a chance which might only return after a
thousand years. Matsuoka referred to negotiations with
the U.S.S.R. for a Non-Aggression Pact. The next day,
Ribbentrop tried to discourage Matsuoka from concluding
the Pact with the U.S.S.R., stating that Japan should
attack Singapore immediately, and this if the U.S.S.R.
interfered, Germany would attack the U.S.S.R. immediately.
Ribbentrop repeated that assurance the following day.
Matsuoka maintained his intention to visit Moscow on his
return from Berlin, and he concluded the Pact with the
U.S.S.R. on the 13th of April 1941.

<h3>French Indo-China</h3>

Matsuoka returned to Japan to conclude the
formal agreements with France and Thailand which he had
arranged before his departure for Berlin and support
for which he had obtained during that visit.
<p>
In June 1940, shortly after the fall of
France, she was forced to agree with Japan's demands
to permit a military mission into Indo-China to ensure
observance of the embargo on materials to China. The
Military Mission arrived at Hanoi on the 29th June 1940.
<p>
The Japanese Cabinet having decided upon its
foreign policy, Foreign Minister Matsuoka moved on 1st

<p><center><i>--882--</i></center><hr><a name=page883></a><p>

August 1940 to put that policy into effect. He called the
French Ambassador and delivered what was virtually an ultimatum
to France regarding French Indo-China. He also discussed
with the German Ambassador an alliance and the
securing of German approval to a Japanese invasion of French
Indo-China.
<p>
In presenting his views to the french Ambassador,
Matsuoka informed him that, although Japan appreciated the
admission of the military mission into French Indo-China,
the Konoye Cabinet desired that France should allow Japanese
troops to be stationed in Northern French Indo-China and
the right to establish air bases there for action against
the National Government of China. The French Ambassador
pointed out that the demand was equivalent to requesting
France to declare war against China, although Japan had
not done so. Matsuoka replied that the request was the
result of necessity and that unless it was granted, French
neutrality might be violated. Matsuoka assured the French
Ambassador that if the request was granted, Japan would
respect French territorial integrity and would evacuate
French Indo-China as soon as possible.
<p>
Matsuoka informed the German Ambassador of his
demands upon France and stated that he would be grateful
if the German Government would not object ot the action
taken and would use its influence to induce the French
Government to grant the demands. The French Ambassador
asked, on 9th August 1940, for a clarification of the
Japanese demands and a guarantee of French territorial
rights in French Indo-China. Matsuoka again requested
the German Government on 14th August 1940 to support the
Japanese demands by influencing the Vichy France Government.
On that day, he threatened France with military

<p><center><i>--883--</i></center><hr><a name=page884></a><p>

action if the decisions to grant the demands of Japan
were further delayed. After further negotiation between
Matsuoka and Henri on 20 and 25th August, the latter,
on 25th August, informed the Japanese Foreign Office that
France had decided to yield to the Japanese demands.
The so-called Matsuoka-Henri Agreement, consisting of an
exchange of letters, was signed on 30th August 1940.
<p>
According to the Matsuoka-Henri Agreement, the
occupation of French indo-China was to be temporary,
as it was stated to be solely for action against China and
would be limited to Tonkin Province; and further, that
Japan would respect the rights and interests of France
in the Far East, especially the territorial integrity
of Indo-China and the sovereignty of France in all parts
of the Union of Indo-China.
<p>
The arrangements for the establishment of air
bases and the passage of Japanese troops into TOnkin
Province were left for negotiation between the head
of the Japanese Military Mission at Hanoi and the
Governor-General of French Indo-China. The Governor-General
of French Indo-China was slow to yield to the
demands of the leader of the Japanese Military Mission,
Nishihara. Nishihara threatened on 4th September 1940
to remove his Mission from Hanoi and order the advance
of the Japanese South China Expeditionary Army across the
French Indo-China border. On 4th September 1940, an agreement
was signed, but certain details remained to be settled.
On 6th September 1940, a unit of the Japanese Army in
China crossed the border into French Indo-China. This
action was said to have occurred through mistake and
negotiations were continued.

The American Ambassador called upon Matsuoka
on 19th September 1940 and informed the Foreign Minister
that the United States Government regarded Japan's demands
upon France as a serious infringement of the status quo
in French Indo-China contrary to the Japanese Cabinet's
announcement. The Ambassador's remonstrance was disregarded,
however, as an understanding had been reached
with the German Government and the Tripartite Pact was
expected to be signed in a few days.
<p>
The Vice-Foreign Minister informed the French
Ambassador on 19th September that unless an agreement
was reached between Nishihara and the Governor-General
of French Indo-China before 23rd September, the Japanese
Army would cross the border into Indo-China on that day.
The Japanese Military Mission evacuated French Indo-China
and put to sea on 22nd September in preparation for the
expected invasion. The Japanese Army began the advance
into French Indo-China at 2:30 p.m. of the same day.
Faced with an actual invasion, the Governor-General was
forced to accept the Japanese demands and signed an agreement
on 24th September 1940 for military occupation of
Tonkin Province, the establishment of air bases and the
grant of military facilities in French Indo-China. The
occupation of Tonkin Province proceeded rapidly and the
air bases were established.

<h3>Relations With the Netherlands East Indies</h3>

Japan's policy and actions having provoked
sanctions and economic restrictions by America, she
decided that her warlike needs, especially of oil, must
be obtained from the Netherlands East Indies.
<p>
On 12th January 1940, Japan gave notice to the
Netherlands that the Treaty of Judicial Settlement,

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--885--</i></center><hr><a name=page886></a><p>
<blockquote>

Arbitration, and Conciliation of August 1935 would
expire in August 1940. Under this treaty, the parties
were bound to settle any dispute between them by peaceful
means, and a permanent committee had been set up to
settle disputes.
<p>
The Foreign Office made a study of Japan's
economic preparation for war in March 1940. That office
came to the conclusion that the United States, having
insisted upon observance of the Nine-Power Pact from the
very beginning of the China War, might be expected to
extend her embargoes against vital war supplies for Japan
if Japanese aggression continued. Ways and means were
considered to make Japan independent of the United States
for the supply of war materials. Counter-measures
suggested were: to seek sources of supplies in other
countries, to consolidate the "intimate relationship" between
Japan, Manchukuo, and China, and to bring the
counties of South East Asia under Japan's economic control.
<p>
The Japanese Minister at The Hague had delivered
to the Netherlands Foreign Minister a Note on 2nd February
making certain demands. The principal demands made at
that time were: that restrictions upon exports from the
Netherlands and Netherlands East Indies to Japan and restrictions
upon imports from Japan into the Netherlands
East Indies should be removed; that laws respecting entry
into the Netherlands East Indies should be modified; that
facilities for Japanese investment in the Netherlands
East Indies should be extended; and that all anti-Japanese
publications in the Netherlands East Indies should be
censored. A reply to these demands was still under
consideration when Germany invaded the Netherlands.
<p>
On the 15th April 1940, Foreign Minister Arita

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--886--</i></center><hr><a name=page887></a><p>
<blockquote>

issued a statement to the press. In this he pointed
out that an intimate economic relationship of mutual
dependence existed between Japan and the South Seas
Region, especially the Netherlands East Indies, and that
if the European War were allowed to spread so as to disturb
the status quo of the Netherlands East Indies, Japan
would be deeply concerned and the peace of East Asia
would be disturbed. The next day, the Japanese Minister
at The Hague called upon the Netherlands Foreign Minister
to explain Japan's concern regarding the maintenance of
the status quo in the Netherlands East Indies. The
Netherlands Minister replied that his Government had not
sought, nor would it seek any country's protection of
the Netherlands East Indies, and that it was determined
to refuse any offer of protection or intervention of any
kind which might be made by any country. the United States
Secretary of State, Mr. Hull, in reply to Arita's press
statement, informed him on 17th April that intervention
in the domestic affairs of the Netherlands East Indies
or any alteration of the status quo anywhere in the entire
Pacific Area by other than peaceful means would be a
threat to the peace.
<p>
Germany invaded the Netherlands on 9th May 1940;
and two day slater, Arita reaffirmed his statement of 15th
April regarding the status quo in the Netherlands East
Indies. This statement contained the information that
he had called upon the Metherlands Minister in Tokyo to
reaffirm the determination of the Netherlands Government
to accept no intervention in the Netherlands East Indies.
The announcement stated that the Governments of the
United States, Great Britain, France, Germany and

<p><center><i>--887--</i></center><hr><a name=page888></a><p>
<blockquote>

Italy had been notified of Japan's continued concern
over the maintenance of the status quo in the Netherlands
East Indies.
<p>
The United States Secretary of State, Mr.
Hull, issued a statement the day following, in which he
said that during recent weeks a number of Governments,
including the United States, Great Britain and Japan,
had made clear in official utterances their attitude of
continued respect for the status quo of the Netherlands
East Indies, that this was in harmony with definite
commitments formally made in writing in 1922, and that
he assumed those Governments would continue to abide by
their commitments. The british Ambassador called upon
Arita on 13th May and delivered a British statement to the
effect that the British Government had no intention of
intervening in the Netherlands East Indies and believed
the Dutch forces there sufficient ot maintain the status
quo. The Netherlands Minister called upon Arita on 15th
May and informed Arita that the Netherlands Government
believed that Great Britain, the United States and
France had no intention of intervening in the Netherlands
East Indies. The French Ambassador called upon Arita
on 16th May and stated that his Government agreed that
the status quo in the Netherlands East Indies should
be maintained.
<p>
The day after the French Ambassador had called
upon Arita and delivered to him the assurance from
France, which completed the assurances from all the
Allied and Neutral Powers concerned that the status quo
would be maintained in the Netherlands Indies, the
Japanese Ambassador called upon Mr. Hull

<p><center><i>--888--</i></center><hr><a name=page889></a><p>
<blockquote>

in Washington. After the Ambassador had questioned
Mr. Hull regarding the status of certain Netherlands
possessions in the Western Hemisphere, Mr. Hull
interrupted him and pointed ot material which had
arrived via news services from Tokyo in which the
Yonai Cabinet was reported to be discussing
frequently questions regarding the Netherlands East
Indies and Japan's supposed special rights in them.
He said that the United States, Great Britain
and France had recently renewed their commitments
to respect the status quo of the Netherlands East
Indies, but notwithstanding the efforts to maintain
an understanding with Japan, there were constantly
coming from Tokyo statements implying that the
commitments had not been made. The Ambassador
assured Mr. Hull that the Yonai Government was
completely satisfied with the situation following
the statements of the powers and that his Government
had no intention of proceeding against the Netherlands
East Indies.
<p>
The Netherlands Minister assured Arita
on 16th May 1940 that the Netherlands East Indies
had no intention of placing any restrictions on the
exportation of oil, tin, rubber and other raw
materials vital to Japan, and was desirous of
maintaining general economic relations with Japan.
In a Note handed to the Netherlands Minister in
Tokyo on 20th May, Arita referred to that assurance
and informed the Minister that Japan desired the
Governor-General of the Netherlands East Indies to
give definite assurances that the quantities of
articles enumerated in an accompanying list would

<p><center><i>--889--</i></center><hr><a name=page890></a><p>
<blockquote>

be exported to Japan each year regardless of
circumstances which might arise. This demand was
rejected by the Netherlands on 6th June and attention
was called ot the fact that economic relations
between the two countries were governed by the
so-called Hart-Ishizawa Agreement of April 1937
and to the further fact that Japan had recently
renewed its commitment to respect the status quo
in the Netherlands East Indies.
<p>
In Berlin, the Japanese Ambassador called
at the German Foreign Office in Berlin on Arita's
instructions and asked for a declaration of the
German position upon the status of the Netherlands
East Indies. Ribbentrop instructed the German
Ambassador in Tokyo to assure Arita that Germany
had no interest in the Netherlands East Indies and
that she thoroughly understood Japan's anxiety
regarding the Netherlands East Indies. He instructed
the Ambassador to mention during his interview with
Arita that Germany, in contrast to the policy of the
other great Powers, had always pursued a policy of
friendship with Japan and believed that this policy
had been advantageous to Japanese interests in
East Asia. The German Ambassador delivered this
declaration of disinterest to Arita on 22nd May as
instructed, for which Arita expressed gratitude.
The next day, the Japanese Press gave great
publicity to the declaration, contrasted the German
attitude with that of the other Posers, and asserted
that the German declaration gave Japan a free hand
to act as she desired with regard to the Netherlands
East Indies. Subsequent events showed that this
assertion was entirely justified. On 24th June

KOISO told the German Ambassador that Japan had colonial
aspirations in Indo-China and the Netherlands East Indies.
Japan, having received Germany's statement of disinterest
in the Netherlands East Indies on 22nd May 1940, informed
the Netherlands Minister in Tokyo on 16th July 1940 of
their intention to send a delegation into Batavia for
economic negotiations. Before the departure of the
mission from Japan, the Yonai Cabinet resigned. The
Second Konoye Cabinet took office on 22nd July. the
basic principles of foreign policy decided by Konoye, War
Minister TOJO, Foreign Minister Matsuoka and the Navy
Minister on 19th July before they assumed office were
formally adopted at the Liaison Conference of 27th July.
The policy thus adopted, among other things, called for
strengthening of the diplomatic policy towards the
Netherlands Eats Indies in order to obtain important
materials. Accordingly, the Konoye Cabinet proceeded with
arrangements to despatch the economic mission to Batavia.
<p>
Drafts of alternative demands to be made upon
the Netherlands were in the course of preparation while
the selection of a chairman for the economic mission was
being debated. The Navy was not prepared for an attack
against the Netherlands East Indies. This is confirmed
by a statement made by prince Fushimi, Chief of the Naval
General Staff, to the Emperor on 10th August 1940, that the
Navy at that time wished to avoid using force against the
Netherlands and Singapore, and that the later war came, the
better, since at least eight months were needed to complete
preparations after a decision for war was made. Now the
help of the Navy was essential in any attack on the Netherlands
East Indies, for seaborne expeditions would be necessary.

Netherlands stated that the Cabinet had decided to express
their opinions frankly upon the problems of entry, enterprise
and investment in the Indies, and requested that the
Netherlands Government agree to the demands of the Japanese
Empire, which was devoting itself to the establishment of
the New Order in East Asia, and Japan maintained that it was
necessary to establish rapidly the economic self-sufficiency
of the Co-Prosperity Sphere centered around Japan, Manchukuo
and China and extending to the South Pacific. The first
proposal asked, <i>inter alia,</I> that the Netherlands East Indies,
as a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, give preferential
treatment to Japan and allow Japan to exploit and develop
certain natural resources of the Indies. The second proposal
asked that the Netherlands East Indies cease relations
with europe and take its place as a member of the Co-Prosperity
Sphere, allow a measure of self-government by
Indonesians, and conclude a joint defense agreement with
Japan to defend the Co-Prosperity Sphere. All restrictions on
the export of goods, especially to Japan, must be abolished.
these were demands which no independent country would grant,
save under duress.
<p>
The mission met with a cool reception when it
arrived in Batavia in September 1940, and Kobayashi, the
head of the Mission, advised Matsuoka on 13th September
1940 that the Governor-General of the Indies was not
impressed by the serious situation and by Japan's threatening
attitude. he suggested termination of the negotiations
as he considered them to be futile. Matsuoka, however, had
advised Kobayashi's assistant, Consul-General Saito, on 3rd
September 1940, that the negotiations should not be limited
to political problems and should also be directed toward the

<p><center><i>--892--</i></center><hr><a name=page893></a><p>
<blockquote>

acquisition of oil fields, as that was one of the Cabinet's
main purposes in despatching the mission to Batavia.
Kobayashi advised Matsuoka on 18th September that he would
continue the negotiations as an aid to the acquisition of
oil fields, but suggested that the negotiations on that
subject, which had until then been in progress in Tokyo,
be transferred to Batavia.
<p>
The Tripartite Pact was signed, and the occupation
of Tonkin Province, together with the acquisition of military
bases in French indo-China was assured in late September 1940.
According to the plan adopted in September and October 1940,
it was decided to develop the attack upon Singapore by
securing bases in French Indo-China and Thailand, and to lull
the Dutch into a sense of security by continuing the
economic negotiations at Batavia while secretly instigating
an independence movement among the natives and securing
military data for the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies.
it was decided also to launch a sudden attack upon Singapore,
and while that attack was in progress, to call upon the
natives of the Netherlands East Indies to declare their
independence of the Netherlands, secure the oil wells and
natural resources of the Netherlands East Indies, and deliver
them intact to the Japanese forces as they advanced from
Singapore to occupy the Netherlands East Indies. The call
for the uprising of the natives of the Indies was to include
a warning that if any of the oil wells or other resources of
the Netherlands East Indies were destroyed, the leading Dutch
officials would be killed by the invading Japanese forces.
The plan contained provisions for the organization of a new
government in the Netherlands East Indies in order that
Japan might conclude a protective treaty with it under the
guise of a military alliance which would provide for the

<p><center><i>--893--</i></center><hr><a name=page894></a><p>
<blockquote>

appointment of Japanese military and economic advisers in
powerful positions in the new government. The new government
was to be organized by a committee of Japanese and
natives, with the Japanese forming a majority, and the
Netherlands East Indies were to be governed by the committee
until the new government could be established.
<p>
The signing of the Tripartite Pact and the
invasion of French Indo-China raised serious misgivings among
the Netherlands delegation at Batavia, who hesitated to continue
the negotiations. The Japanese delegation assured
them that the Pact was not directed toward the Netherlands
Government and that Japan desired to continue the negotiations
in order to promote friendly political and economic
relations between the Netherlands East Indies and Japan.
The Netherlands delegation agreed to continue, on the understanding
that Japan had no hostile intentions towards, and
did not claim leadership over the Netherlands East Indies,
and requested the Japanese delegation to submit a list of
points for discussion. On the day that the assurance was
given, Kobayashi sent to Matsuoka a recommendation that no
time should be lost in placing the Netherlands East Indies in
the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and that, with that in mind, appropriations
should include funds for propaganda and training
of personnel in preparation for that move. the new policy
necessitated the replacement of Kobayashi by a man thoroughly
familiar with the policy and plan. Kobayashi announced his
recall to Tokyo two days after giving the above assurance.
<p>
The Japanese Ambassador in Berlin informed the
German Government that Japan was prepared to act as purchasing
agent to supply the German Government with vital war
materials from the Far East and the Netherlands East Indies
in return for Germany's support of Japan's advance to the

<p><center><i>--894--</i></center><hr><a name=page895></a><p>

South and into the South Seas. The German Government
accepted this offer, and on 4th October 1940, delivered to
the Ambassador bills of exchange as advance payment for
tin, rubber, castor oil, and spice to be obtained in the
Netherlands East Indies. A complete working agreement for
conducting the purchases was made. This agreement made
further revision of the policy toward the Netherlands East
Indies necessary. The Cabinet, on 25th October 1940, revised
its policy to meet its agreement with Germany. It was
decided that the obligations of the Japanese Government to
Germany required the Indies to be in the Greater East Asia
Economic Sphere immediately by establishing close economic
relations and by developing and utilizing their rich natural
resources for cooperation with the Axis Powers. Complete
details of a plan to place the policy into effect were
agreed upon. Among others, these were that the Netherlands
East Indies should sever economic relations with Europe and
America, that the production in and export of essential war
materials from the Netherlands East Indies should be placed
under Japanese control, and that the formulation and execution
of all economic problems of the Netherlands East
Indies should be placed under a Japanese-Netherlands Commission.
Had these ends been achieved, Japan would have
controlled the economy of the Indies.
<p>
OSHIMA, who at this time had no diplomatic post,
wrote an article for the <i>Yomiuri</i> newspaper on 27th October
1940, in which he called attention to Japan's obligation to
cooperate with the Axis, pointing out that the Tripartite
Pact imposed new obligations. He advised that the Japanese
should realize that fact and establish a close relationship
of mutual harmony and prosperity among Japan, French Indo-China,
India, the Netherlands East Indies, the South Seas

Islands, etc., for cooperation with Germany and Italy. He
referred to the American embargo on vital war supplies,
which was then being increased in an effort to halt further
Japanese aggression, and said that America was not the
world's arbiter, and that if she would employ her vast natural
resources to help establish the New Order, she would indeed
make a great contribution to world peace.
<p>
The Netherlands delegation had given the Japanese
an elaborate and detailed statement of the oil situation on
7th October 1940, in which they set forth the amount of the
various petroleum products they were prepared to supply to
Japan in view of the overall situation and demands by other
countries, and also detailed the areas in the Netherlands
East Indies which were available to the Japanese for exploration
and exploitation for oil The Japanese delegation
replied on 21st October 19940 that they were not satisfied
with the amount of oil which the Dutch proposed to supply,
and expressed general dissatisfaction with the proposals.
They said that Japan desired to acquire rights to explore
and exploit not only the oil areas reserved for private
enterprise, but also the Government reserve areas as well.
<p>
Consul-General Saito, in commenting upon the
proposals to Matsuoka on 25th October 1940, explained, that
from the viewpoint of an industrialist, the proposals were
most reasonable, but that from a strategical viewpoint,
they should be given further consideration. He pointed out
that the plan to prospect for oil must be used for the
exploration of areas as bases for military operations against
the Dutch by sending into those areas a large number of
planes, as well as troops disguised as labourers, and he
requested advice as to the areas considered strategically
important by the Military.

The Japanese delegation purported to accept the
Dutch proposals on 29th October 1940. They, however,
stated that they understood the proposals and their
acceptance as granting to Japan certain large areas in
Borneo, the Celebes, Dutch New Guinea, the Aroa Archipelago
and the Schouten Archipelago as Japan's sphere for
exploration and exploitation for oil They added that
areas in Sumatra were also desired and that Japanese
interests desired to participate in the capital investment
of the Dutch oil companies. The Dutch took the
position that the acceptance, which went far beyond the
Dutch offer, put an end to the negotiations. The Konoye
Cabinet however, had completed its plans to place the
policy decisions of September and October 1940 into
effect. Their preparations for employing force against
the Netherlands were not yet complete. They announced
that a special envoy was about to be appointed to instill
new life into the negotiations. This envoy was appointed
on 28th November 1940. He was Yoshizawa, a member of the
House of Peers and formerly the Foreign Minister in the
Inukai Cabinet.
<p>
Yoshizawa proceeded to Batavia and presented
new proposals on 6th January 1941, which were in keeping
with the policy decisions of October 1940. In the preamble
to those proposals, it was stated that a certain
interdependence existed between Japan and the Netherlands
East Indies, that the Indies were abundant in natural resources
and thinly populated and undeveloped, and that
Japan earnestly desired to participate in the exploitation
of their natural resources and to promote trade and
economic relations with the Netherlands East Indies. The
detailed proposals called for modification of the entry

<p><center><i>--897--</i></center><hr><a name=page898></a><p>

laws, granting mining and fishing rights to Japanese,
opening an air service between Japan and the Netherlands
East Indies, abolition of restrictions upon Japanese
ships, the lifting of import and export restrictions,
and the granting of manufacturing and enterprising
rights to Japanese nationals in the Netherlands East
Indies. These proposals, if accepted, would have placed
the Netherlands East Indies under the economic domination
of Japan. Had they been accepted, Japan would have
obtained without war at least a considerable portion
of her aggressive aims in South East Asia.
<p>
Yoshizawa reported to Matsuoka that he did not
expect a favourable reply to this proposals, as the
Netherlands East Indies were depending more

and more on Great Britain and the United States since
the removal of the Dutch Government to London, following
the German invasion of the Netherlands. He stated that
the defeat of the Italian Army in the Mediterranean
Theater, the firm attitude of the United States toward
Japan, and the improvement of the Indies defences, had
given the Dutch new confidence, and that determined
measures would be necessary to include the Netherlands
East Indies in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.
<p>
The Netherlands delegation answered Yoshizawa's
proposals on 3rd February 1941 by stating that their
first consideration was to provide for the welfare and
progress of the native population of the Netherlands
East Indies by improving economic relations and increasing
trade with all neutral countries in a spirit of goodwill,
and that the interest of the Netherlands East
Indies demanded that economic relations with foreign
countries be maintained on a basis of strict non-discrimination.
They also pointed out that during the
war, it was necessary to restrict trade and other economic
activities in order to ensure that direct or indirect
advantages would not accrue to enemies of the Netherlands.
A strong objection was then made to the claim of interdependence
between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies
as being unwarranted by the facts.
<p>
The Dutch reply to Yoshizawa's proposals left
the door open for further negotiations, but the Dutch
were aware of a speech delivered by Matsuoka before the
Diet on 21st January 1941, as well as of events in French
Indo-China dn Thailand which seemed to indicate preparations
for military action by Japan against the Netherlands
East Indies, and consequently were suspicious of the

<p><center><i>--899--</i></center><hr><a name=page900></a><p>
<blockquote>

continuation of the negotiations. They warned the
Japanese delegation that a Japanese occupation of
Southern French Indo-China would constitute a military
menace towards the Netherlands East Indies of such
seriousness that it would cancel any agreement reached
in the economic negotiations.
<p>
Matsuoka had said in his speech on 21st
January 1941, that the Netherlands East Indies and French
Indo-China, if only for geographical reasons, should be
in intimate and inseparable relationship with Japan.
He declared that the situation which had hitherto
thwarted that relationship should be remedied, and
pointed to the negotiations at Batavia as being directed
to that end. Yoshizawa attributed the rejection of his
proposals to Matsuoka's speech and complained to
Matsuoka, warning him that if he were to be successful
in maintaining the negotiations while the attack was
being prepared, it was necessary for the officials in
Tokyo to conduct themselves in a manner more conducive
to that end.
<p>
The Dutch had been warned; and on 13th February
1941, Yoshizawa informed Matsuoka that the Dutch expected
positive aid from the United States and Great Britain
and preferred to rely upon the United States rather
than upon Japan. He advised that discontinuance of the
negotiations at Batavia was merely a matter of time, and
that Japan's only means of settling the Indies problem
was by force. Konoye instructed Yoshizawa on 28th March
1941 that failure of the negotiations would injure
Japan's prestige, and that as the European situation was
rapidly changing, the Japanese delegation should remain
in batavia to await developments, despite the Dutch

<p><center><i>--900--</i></center><hr><a name=page901></a><p>
<blockquote>

attitude. These instructions were followed, and the
negotiations continued.
<p>
The Japanese delegation replied on 14th May
1941 to the Dutch rejection of their proposals by making
modified proposals, but stated that they desired to make
it clear that the views expressed in the preamble to
their proposals of 16th January were firmly held by
the Japanese Government. The Netherlands delegation,
aware of the further developments in the dispute between
French Indo-China and Thailand, as well as the signing
of the Soviet-Japanese Non-Aggression Pact, rejected
the modified proposals on 6th June 1941 as being
incompatible with the essential principles of Netherlands
economic policy. They also required that raw materials
exported from the Indies to Japan would not be reexported
to Germany.
<p>
The next day, Yoshizawa urgently requested
authority to withdraw from the negotiations as he
feared a Dutch request for the departure of his delegation.
Matsuoka, describing the terms of the Dutch
reply as "unwarrantable", authorized discontinuance of
the negotiations. Yoshizawa asked for an audience with
the Governor-General of the Netherlands East Indies on
17th June 1941. After making one last futile attempt
to secure modification of the Dutch attitude, he produced
a draft of a joint communiqu&eacute; to be issued
announcing termination of the negotiations. The communiqu&eacute;,
designed to save "face" for Japan both at home
and abroad, was approved with minor changes by both
delegations; it contained this statement: "It is
needless to add that the discontinuance of the negotiations
will lead to no change in the normal relations

between the Netherlands East Indies and Japan."

<h3>Preparations Following Tripartite Pact</h3>
</center>

TOJO said, during the discussion of the Tripartite
Pact before the Investigation Committee of the
Privy Council, that the Cabinet had considered the
possibility of war with the United States resulting from
the conclusion of the Pact, and revealed that there had
been careful planning to meet that eventuality. The
discussion at the Imperial Conference and before the
Investigation Committee of the Privy Council in September
1940 revealed that the Navy considered a Japanese-American
war inevitable and was completely prepared for it, excepting
that no adequate provision had been made for replenishing
its war reserves of oil. HOSHINO said that the
Planning Board had been carefully planning for the war with
the United States by accumulating vital war materials,
including oil, and that he considered the supply sufficient
for a short, decisive war. He considered, moreover,
that the supply could be replenished from the
Netherlands East Indies and elsewhere if the war should
be prolonged. The Privy Councillors were aware that
the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact probably meant
war with the United States, and in reporting upon the Pact,
recommended that all necessary preparations be made for it.
<p>
Extensive preparation for war with the United
States, Great Britain and other Powers followed. The
puppet Central Government of China was recognized and
the Japan-Manchukuo-China economic bloc was strengthened
to improve Japan's economic position to meet the American
embargo on war supplies after War Minister HATA and other
Japanese leaders had publicly proclaimed that Japanese

<p><center><i>--902--</i></center><hr><a name=page903></a><p>
<blockquote>

operations would not be stopped by what they termed the
obsolete Nine-Power Treaty. The Planning Board under
HOSHINO renewed its efforts to accumulate vital
materials. As already related, Konoye's Imperial Rule
Assistance Association was organized with the help of
HOSHINO, KIDO and HASHIMOTO to steel the people against
the deprivations of the war with the United States and
Great Britain which the Japanese leaders claimed to be
inevitable. Propaganda in the form of writings and
lectures was disseminated to popularize the waging of
wars of aggression for acquisition of territory and
natural resources. HASHIMOTO, SHIRATORI and OSHIMA
were heavy contributors to this propaganda campaign. A
military planning board in the form of the Total War
Research Institute was organized and placed in operation
with HOSHINO as its first President and with SUZUKI as
one of its Councillors. OSHIMA was sent to Germany to
promote cooperations between the Axis members in the
adventure upon which they had embarked.

<center>
<h3>Relations With U.S.A. and Great Britain</h3>
</center>

In October 1940, Konoye issued a statement to
the Press in which he said that his government was maneuvering
diplomatically to induce the United States,
Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. to recognize the Co-Prosperity
Sphere envisaged by the Japanese leaders, a
euphemism for Japan's domination of East Asia. He
implied that if the United States refused to understand
the real intentions of Japan, she, as well as Britain,
would be forced into war. The United States Government
because of that statement, extended its embargo to iron
and steel scrap and increased its preparedness for

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--903--</i></center><hr><a name=page904></a><p>
<blockquote>

defense. The Japanese Embassy in Washington complained
that the Japanese Government found it difficult to concede
that the extension of the embargo was caused solely
by concern for the defence of the United States. The
United States Government replied that despite the Nine-Power
Treaty and other Japanese obligations, American
trade had been practically eliminated from Manchuria and
North China, and that it now appeared that Japan was
intent upon forcing American enterprises from Shanghai also.
<p>
The United States Government was concerned
about Japan's advance to the south and the conclusion
of the Tripartite Pact, which had been followed by
Konoye's warning. The President of the United States,
in an address to Congress, declared that at no previous
time had American security been so seriously threatened.
On 15th January 1941, the Secretary of State told the
Committee of Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives
that it was clear that Japan was animated from
the start by broad and ambitious plans for establishing
herself in a dominant position in the entire region of
the Western Pacific, and that her leaders had openly
declared their determination to achieve and maintain
that position by force of arms, so as to make themselves
masters of an area containing almost one half of the
entire population of the world. It was apparent to the
Government of the United States that the Japanese
military leaders were about to undertake the conquest
of the entire Pacific Area, at least to the westward of
Hawaii and extending to the South Seas and to India.
<p>
The United States Pacific Fleet, based at
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, represented one of the greatest

<p><center><i>--904--</i></center><hr><a name=page905></a><p>
<blockquote>

obstacles to the execution of the Konoye Cabinet's
policy for military moves to the South. It was feared
by many of the Japanese leaders that this fleet might
be used to reinforce Singapore, and they advocated an
immediate attack upon Singapore to prevent this. The
Japanese Navy, however, was demanding that more oil
essential supplies be accumulated and that adequate
preparations be made for replenishing those supplies
before launching the attack upon Singapore. The Navy
estimated in August 1940 that at least eight months
would be required for this preparation. The Navy maintained
its demands before the Imperial Conference and
the Privy Council during the discussions which preceded
the signing of the Tripartite Pact.
<P>
The general plan adopted by the Konoye Cabinet
took the Navy's demands into consideration by providing
for an attempt to eliminate the threat of the United
States Pacific Fleet through negotiations for a non-aggression
pact with the United States Government. The
suggestion was that, as part of such a Treaty, Japan
should guarantee the security of the Philippines and
Guam, and the United States should recognize the
Co-Prosperity Sphere. Preparation for an attack
upon the United States forces was to proceed during the
negotiations, so that in case the negotiations should
fail, a surprise attack might be launced.
<br>
A plan to destroy the United States Pacific
Fleet while it lay at anchor in Pearl Harbor by a surprise
attack to be launched while the United States was
at peace with Japan, was conceived and submitted to the
Commander of the Combined Fleets for study. He approved
the plan and transmitted it to the Imperial General

<p><center><i>--905--</i></center><hr><a name=page906></a><p>
<blockquote>

Headquarters as early as January 1941. The plan called
for the organization of a task force to deliver an
aerial attack upon the United States Pacific Fleet at
Pearl Harbor. to avoid detection and make the surprise
complete, this force was to use a Northern route little
used by commercial shipping. In conjunction with the
aerial attack, it was planned to use submarines to
destroy any ships that might attempt to escape the air
attack. There were many details to be worked out, such
as the development and manufacture of shallow water
torpedoes and midget submarines, as well as the perfection
of a method of refueling at sea to allow the employment
of the longer but more secure Northern route of approach.
The Japanese leaders considered that if the attack upon
Pearl Harbor should be successful and result in the
destruction of the United States Fleet, they would be
able to seize all the important points in the Pacific
and Indian Oceans before the United States would be able
to prepare and launch a counter-attack. It was hoped
that the United States would weary of a prolonged
and costly war, and negotiate a peace which would
recognize Japan's supremacy in the territories it would
have seized.
<p>
Foreign Minster Matsuoka took the first step
toward the execution of the Cabinet's plan in January
1941 by appointing Nomura as Ambassador to the United
States to undertake the negotiations. Matsuoka delivered
to Nomura his instructions on 22nd January, immediately
before Nomura's departure from Japan. These
were that Nomura should make the President of the
United States and his subordinate officials understand
that Japan had been forced to sign the Tripartite Pact

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--906--</i></center><hr><a name=page907></a><p>
<blockquote>

because of American and British interference wit the
organization of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, that the Pact
was merely defensive, but that it provided for immediate
military assistance from the other two Powers in case
the United States attacked any one of the Signatory
Powers, and that Japan would be faithful to the Alliance.
He further instructed Nomura to advise the United States
Government that it would be well for the United States
to cease interference with Japan's aims in East Asia
and to cooperate with Japan in the establishment of
the Co-Prosperity Sphere in return for an opportunity
to participate in the benefits which might accrue from
the establishment of that sphere.
<p>
A propaganda campaign was immediately commenced,
which was designed to convince the United
States Government of the gravity of the situation and
of the need for prompt negotiation of an understanding.
The Cabinet decided to secure bases on Camranh bay and
around Saigon for an attack to the South and called
upon the German Government to prevent the reinforcement
of French troops in French Indo-China. The Plan was
approved at the Liaison Conference on 39th January 1941.
The United States Government learned of the plan from
its observer at Vichy, France, who reported on 28th
January 1941 that the German Government had forbidden
the Vichy Government to send reinforcements. in consequence
of this, America, on 3rd February 1941, added
many non-ferrous metals and potash to its embargo list.
It was at this time that Mr. Eden saw SHIGEMITSU and
asked for an explanation of the report form the British
Ambassador in Tokyo to the effect that a crisis was
expected in the Far East within a week or two.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--907--</i></center><hr><a name=page908></a><p>
<blockquote>

The extension of the embargo by the United
States Government caused Matsuoka some embarrassment in
the Diet. He sent Nomura further instructions. He
urged Nomura, immediately upon his arrival in Washington,
to make it clear that Japan had never intended to attack
the United States, but that the Japanese Government
did not understand why the United States was preparing
for war against Japan; and that, if the United States
continued to prepare, the result would endanger peace
in the Pacific, as Japan had not been so much exhausted
by the China war as some seemed to think and that continued
warlike preparation by the United States was not
advisable. He again instructed Nomura to emphasize the
necessity for cooperation between the two Governments
in the establishment of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in
order to avert a crisis in the Pacific Area.
<p>
The United States Lend-Lease Act became effective
and gave new encouragement to the Powers resisting
the Axis to the extent that the Netherlands delegation
increased its resistance to the demands of the Japanese
economic mission at Batavia. Mr. Eden was awaiting a
reply from SHIGEMITSU to his inquiry regarding the report
of an impending crisis in the Far East, and the American
Ambassador in Tokyo was demanding cessation of Japanese
interference with American trade in French Indo-China.
Matsuoka instructed SHIGEMITSU to inform Mr. Eden that
the British Ambassador's report of an impending crisis
was a ridiculous fantasy, although only three days before
he had informed the German Ambassador that he planned to
visit Berlin to learn the attitude of the German Government
toward the activities of the United States Government,
for, as he explained, Japan planned to attack
Singapore to deprive the United

<p><center><i>--908--</i></center><hr><a name=page909></a><p>
<blockquote>

States as bases in the Pacific in case she should
enter the European War. This was the situation
when Nomura arrived in Washington.
<p>
The President of the United States
received Nomura on 14th February 1941. He said
that relations between the United States and
Japan were deteriorating as a result of Japan's
advance to the South and the conclusion of the
Tripartite Pact. He suggested that the new
Ambassador might like to re-examine and frankly
discuss with the United States Secretary of
State the important phases of American-Japanese
relations. Nomura made a cautious reply to the
President, and in reporting to Matsuoka, asked for
further clarification of Japan's obligation to
attack the United States in the event of that
Power's entry into the European War. Matsuoka
replied to Nomura on 4th March that he had made
his position clear on that point on a number of
occasions, that Japan would participate in the
war in case the United States declared war on Germany.
<p>
The preparations for the attack upon
Singapore were rapidly progressing. OSHIMA informed
Ribbentrop in Berlin on 22nd February
1941 that the preparations would be complete by
the end of May, and that for safety's sake, preparations
were also being made for war upon the
United States as well as upon Great Britain.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--909--</i></center><hr><a name=page910></a><p>
<blockquote>

He said that the occupation of the Philippines
had been included in the preparations. Notwithstanding
these preparations, Matsuoka assured
Mr. Eden in his message of 17th February of the
Japanese Government's peaceful intentions, and
suggested that Japan act as mediator of the
European War. The British Government rejected
the offer on 24th February 1941, and said that,
although it had been an unwilling participant
in the European War, with the assistance it was
receiving from the United States it would be
able to maintain itself against all enemies,
and that it was determined to continue the war
until Naziism was completely eradicated from Europe.
<p>
United States Secretary of State Hull
and Ambassador Nomura held a conversation on
8th March 1941. Nomura said it was unthinkable
that Japan and the United States should fight
because of the destructive effects that would
inevitably result. Mr. Hull agreed with him,
but enquired whether the Japanese Military, who
were in control of the Japanese Government, could
expect the United States to sit quiet while two
or three nations organized naval and military
forces and went out to conquer the rest of the
world. Nomura denied that these were the intentions
of his Government and said he did not believe
there would be any more military movements

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--910--</i></center><hr><a name=page911></a><p>
<blockquote>

unless the United States embargo should force
his Government ot make them. Mr. Hull then
mentioned the Tri-Partite Pact and the public
declarations of Hitler, Matsuoka and other important
German and Japanese leaders to the
effect that their countries under the Pact were
determined to establish a New Order in the World
by use of force. Nomura again denied that it
was the intention of his Government to use military
force for conquest. Mr. Hull replied that
as long as Japanese forces were all over China
and as far south as Thailand and Indo-China,
and so long as this was accompanied by threatening
declarations by Japanese statesmen, there
could only be increasing concern by nations who
were vitally interested in halting the world conquest
by force.
<p>
The President of the United States
talked with Nomura again on 14th March 1941,
only three days after Matsuoka, with the assistance
of the German Government, had forced the
Vichy French Government to accept Japanese terms
of settlement of the border dispute between
France and Thailand. The President complained
to Nomura that the American people were
aroused over what appeared to be a concerted
effort under the Tripartite Pact to effect a
junction of the German and Italian forces
approaching the Suez Canal and the Japanese
forces approaching Singapore. Nomura assured
the President that Japan did not intend to

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--911--</i></center><hr><a name=page912></a><p>
<blockquote>

advance further to the South. The President
then suggested that an armed clash between
Japan and the United States could be avoided
if the Japanese Government would remove the
cause of the American people's suspicion of
their intentions.
<p>
Matsuoka went to Berlin for consultations
with Hitler upon the question of concerted
action under the Tri-Partite Pact after
receiving the French acceptance of his terms for
settlement of the France-Thailand dispute. He
paused in Moscow, and the American AMbassador
in the U.S.S.R. was invited to talk with him on
24th March 1941. Matsuoka was emphatic in his
assurance to the American Ambassador that under
no circumstances would Japan attack Singapore or
any American, British or Dutch possession and he
insisted that Japan had no territorial ambitions.
He said that Japan was ready to join the United
States in a guarantee of the territorial integrity
and political independence of the Philippines.
He declared that Japan would not go to war
with the United States. However, upon Matsuoka's
arrival in Berlin, he explained to Hitler that
his denials of his Government's intentions to
attack were intended to deceive the British and
Americans until the day when Japan would suddenly
attack Singapore.

<center>
<h3>United States Conditions for Discussions</h3>
</center>

Colonel Iwakuro, of Nomura's staff,
working in cooperation with certain private
citizens of the United States and Japan, composed
a draft of proposals which it was thought
might serve as the basis for an agreement between
Japan and the United States. This draft
was presented to the State Department for delivery
to Mr. Hill. Mr. Hull saw Nomura on
16th April 1941, informed him that the draft
had been received, but that the United
States Government could only consider proposals presented
formally by the Ambassador. Nomura said
he was prepared to present the draft formally
as a basis for negotiations. Mr. Hull explained
to Nomura that before the United States Government
would commence negotiations, it was necessary
for the Japanese Government to convince the American
Government of its sincerity by abandoning
its doctrine of conquest by force and its use of
force as an instrument of national policy and to
adopt the principles which the United States had
proclaimed and was practising, and which it considered
as embodying the foundation on which all
relations between Nations should properly rest.
Mr. Hull then stated these principles as being:
(1) Respect for the territorial integrity and
the sovereignty of each and all nations: (2)
Non-interference in the internal affairs of
other countries; (3) Equality of commercial

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--913--</i></center><hr><a name=page914></a><p>
<blockquote>

opportunity; and (4) Non-disturbance of the
status quo of the Pacific, except by peaceful
means. Mr. Hull emphasized that his talk must
not be considered as the commencement of negotiations
and that his statement of principles
must be accepted before negotiations could begin.
Nomura replied that he was convinced that his
Government had no intention of advancing further
to the South, but that he would submit the principles
enunciated by Mr. Hull to his Government and
ask for instructions.
<p>
Nomura's request for instructions was
received in the Japanese Foreign Office on 18th
April 1941 and Konoye consulted with KIDO and
the Emperor upon the answer to be given. The
principle of equality of commercial opportunity
appealed to the Zaibatsu, which urged the Cabinet
to commence negotiations upon the basis of the
proposed draft. KIDO and Konoye agreed that
negotiations might be commenced with the United
States Government, but that the Cabinet should be
careful to keep faith with the German and Italian
Governments, and should not abandon its plan to
establish the Co-Prosperity Sphere, that being
Japan's fixed national policy.
<p>
Matsuoka, on his return to Tokyo, again
paused in Moscow, where negotiations resulted in
his signing of the Japanese-Soviet Non-Aggression
Pact on 13th April 1941. He explained to the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--914--</i></center><hr><a name=page915></a><p>
<blockquote>

German Ambassador to Japan, who was accompanying
him, that the Pact would substantially
facilitate the Japanese advance to the South.
<p>
Konoye, after discussing with KIDO and
the Emperor the reply to be given to Nomura's
request for instructions, cabled Matsuoka to
return to Tokyo promptly in order to consider
the matter. Matsuoka arrived in Tokyo on 22nd
April 1941, and sent Nomura a draft proposal to
submit to the United States Government.
<p>
The campaign of infringement of the
interests of the United States continued during
the deliberation upon the answer to be given to
Nomura. Japanese interference with the movements
of American nationals and American merchandise in
China became more pronounced. The American Consulate
at Kunming in China was bombed for the
third time and heavy damage caused. The Japanese
Navy occupied Eniwetok Atoll and began setting up
naval installations there. On 5th Mary 1941, the
United States Government answered those acts by
adding additional items, including scrap rubber,
to its embargo list.
<P>
Ribbentrop learned of the conditions
laid down by the United States for the commencement
of the negotiations between Japan and the
United States, and of the Japanese Cabinet's decision
to open negotiations. He immediately
stated to Ambassador OSHIMA that he could not

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--915--</i></center><hr><a name=page916></a><p>
<blockquote>

understand submitting to such conditions.
OSHIMA assured Ribbentrop that his
government had non intention of entering into
any treaty with the United States embodying
the principles laid down by Mr. Hull.
Ribbentrop accused the Japanese Cabinet of
having abandoned its plan for attacking
Singapore and of having broken faith with
the German Government. He demanded that the
Japanese Government either refuse to agree to
the Hull principles or agree only on condition
that the American Government give its assurance
that it would remain neutral. OSHIMA agreed
with Ribbentrop, transmitted his views to Matsuoka,

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--916--</i></center><hr><a name=page917></a><p>
<blockquote>

and stated that he considered Ribbentrop's suspicions
and accusation well-founded. He recommended that the
Cabinet adopt ribbentrop's suggestion.
<p>
On 8 May 1941, Nomura reported to Matsuoka and
pointed out that the United States would not recognize the
New Order in East Asia, nor the retention of territory
acquired through aggression, and was insistent on the
observance of the four principles enunciated by Mr. Hull.
<p>
Nomura delivered the first official Japanese
proposal to Mr. Hull on 12 May 1941. That draft was
couched in obscure and platitudinous terms, which really
provided for a secrete understanding between the two Governments,
in substance as follows: The United States
Government would agree (1) to recognize the establishment
by Japan of the New Order in China in accordance with
Konoye's three principles as embodied in the Japan-Manchukuo-China
Joint Declaration of 30 November 1940,
and 6to advise generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek to negotiate
peace with Japan forthwith; (2) to enter into a secret
agreement to withdraw aid to the National Government of
China if the generalissimo did not enter into negotiations
for peace; (3) to recognize the right of Japan to establish
the Co-Prosperity Sphere embracing China and the Southern
Area upon the understanding that Japan's expansion in
that area was to be of a peaceful nature and to cooperate
in producing and procuring from this sphere the natural
resources which Japan needs: 94) to amend its immigration
laws so as to admit Japanese nationals on the basis
of equality and non-discrimination; (5) to restore
normal economic relations between the two countries;
(6) to take note of Japan's obligation under Article 3

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--917--</i></center><hr><a name=page918></a><p>
<blockquote>

of the Tripartite Pact to attack the United States
if, in the opinion of the Japanese Government, the
assistance rendered to the Allied Powers resisting
Germany and Italy amounted to an attack upon the Axis;
and (7) to refrain from rendering assistance to the
Allied Powers. The Japanese Government in return
would agree to (1) resume normal trade relations with
the United States; (2) assure the United States an
supply of the commodities available in the Co-Prosperity
Sphere; and (3) join the United States Government
in a guarantee of the independence of the Philippines
on condition that the Philippines would maintain an
status of permanent neutrality.
<p>
The day after this draft proposal was
delivered to Mr. Hull, the Japanese delegation at
Batavia delivered its amended demands to the dutch
delegation which reiterated the Japanese Government's
previous declaration of interdependence between the
Netherlands East Indies and Japan. In Tokyo,
Matsuoka informed the american Ambassador that both
he and Konoye were determined that Japan's advance
to the South would be made by peaceful means, "unless",
he added significantly, "circumstances rendered that
impossible." The American Ambassador inquired what
circumstances Matsuoka had in mind. Matsuoka replied
that he referred to the concentration of British troops
in Malaya, which he described as provocative.
<p>
Ribbentrop learned of the draft proposal
presented by Nomura to the United States of America,
and immediately took OSHIMA to task, expressing
resentment of Matsuoka's decision to commence
negotiations with the United States without consulting

the German and Italian Governments. He demanded
that the attack upon Singapore be commenced without
further delay. OSHIMA, reporting to Matsuoka, said:
"I express my apprehension that should Japan lose
this opportunity to expand southward and the possibility
of attacking Singapore, she will invite the contempt
not only of the United States and Great Britain, but
also of Germany and Italy." He informed Matsuoka
of the resentment of the German leaders against the
negotiations with the United States and stated that,
since the Japanese-American negotiations were considered
to involve a change in Japanese foreign policy which
violated the plans of the military, he had taken the
liberty of informing the Japanese Army and Navy
officials. This was the beginning of the friction
between Konoye and Matsuoka.

<h3>United States Agrees to Negotiate -- May 1941</h3>
</center>

The United States Government accepted the
Japanese draft proposal of the 12th May 1941 as a
starting point for the negotiations and undertook
to explore the possibility of an understanding with
the Japanese Government. On 28 May 1941, Mr. Hull
and Nomura met. In the course of the conversation, it
became clear that there were two great obstacles to any
successful prosecution of the negotiations: (1) the
obscurity in which Japan's commitments under the Tri-Partite
Pact were at present left, and (32) the provisions

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--919--</i></center><hr><a name=page920></a><p>
<blockquote>

for settlement of the China question. As to the
first matter, Mr. Hull desired that Japan qualify
its attitude towards the possible event of the
United States being drawn into the European War
as a measure of self-defense. As to the second
matter, Mr. Hull pointed out that the Japanese
insistence on retaining troops in China after the
conclusion of any peace treaty with China would be
a factor operating against friendship between the
United States and Japan. Nomura was not able to
state how many troops Japan proposed to retain in
China, nor the areas where they would be quartered.
<p>
On 31 May, Mr. Hull told Nomura that, at some
proper time before definitive discussions, he would
discuss the draft proposal in strict confidence with
the Chungking Government. Moreover, on 31 May, a
further United States draft was handed to Nomura, in
which it was proposed, <i>inter alia,</i> that Japan
should state that the provisions of the Tripartite
Pact did not apply to nations which became involved
in the European War by reasons of protection, self-defense
and national security. It was further proposed
that Japan should submit to the United States
of America the framework of the terms which she would
submit to China. Annexed to this draft was a full
statement of the attitude of the United States towards
the activities of Germany and a declaration that the
United States was resolved to take measures of self-defense
in resistance to a movement which, in the
view of the United States of America, was clearly
directed to world conquest by force.
<p>
On the 4th of June, the Japanese Embassy
suggested certain amendments to the American proposals.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--920--</i></center><hr><a name=page921></a><p>
<blockquote>

Among them was the suggestion that the United States
should drop from its draft the provision that the obligations
of Japan under the Tripartite Pact did not apply
to the case where a nation became involved in the European
War as a measure of self-defence. Mr. Hull considered
these Japanese amendments, and on 6th June, he told Nomura
that they had carried the negotiations away from the fundamental
points which the United States of America believed
to be involved. In his view, they revealed a stressing
of Japan's alignment with the Axis, no clear indication
of intention to place Japan's relations with China on a
basis which would contribute to peace in the Far East,
and a veering away from clearcut commitments on policies
of peace and non-discriminatory treatment. Nevertheless,
Nomura on 15 June 1941, submitted to Mr. Hull a new draft
embodying the very suggestions to which Mr. Hull had already
taken objection. Chungking was bombed by more than
100 Japanese planes on 10th June and American property was
destroyed. Public statements by spokesmen of the Japanese
Government emphasized Japan's commitment and intentions
under the Tripartite Pact in a sense hostile to the interests
of the United States of America. The negotiations
at Batavia were obviously breaking down. The United
States Government issued an order on 20th June banning all
shipments of oil, except those to Great Britain and South America.
<p>
The Japanese had been pressing for an answer
to their proposals of 12th May. Mr. Hull talked to Nomura
on 21st June. He referred to the accumulating evidence
from all over the world, including the public statements
of Japanese leaders, indicating that the Japanese Military
would endorse no understanding with the United States
except one that envisaged Japan fighting on the side of

<p><center><i>--921--</i></center><hr><a name=page922></a><p>
<blockquote>

Hitler, should the United States become involved in the
European War through its programme of aid to the democracies.
He then stated that the proposal of 12th May
1941 violated the principles which the American Government
was committed to uphold, particularly in respect to
the provisions of the proposal relating to China. Mr. Hull
then informed Nomura that he had come to the conclusion
that, before proceeding with the negotiations, the United
States Government must await some clearer indication than
had yet been given that the Japanese government desired
to pursue a course of peace. He expressed the hope that
the Japanese Government would manifest such an attitude.

<center>
<h3>Preparations Intensified</h3>
</center>

The plan of September and October 1940 had
been followed. The ultimate objective of the plan was
the domination of East Asia by Japan. That objective was
to be reached by the use of force if necessary. Some of
the steps to be taken in the execution of that plan were
in the alternative. The tripartite Pact had been entered
into and used as an instrument for the intimidation of the
Western Powers and as a guarantee of cooperation by the
Axis Powers with Japan as she advanced to the South. The
Non-Aggression Pact had been signed with the U.S.S.R. as
a protection of Japan's rear as she made that advance.
The attempt to negotiate a peace with generalissimo Chiang
Kai-Shek in order to free Japanese troops and acquire the
use of Chinese troops in making that advance had failed.
The attempt to mediate the European War, and thereby
secure British recognition of Japan's advance into South
East Asia so as to eliminate the necessity of an attack
upon Singapore had likewise failed.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--922--</i></center><hr><a name=page923></a><p>
<blockquote>

The attempt to eliminate possible interference
with that attack by the United States Pacific Fleet through
negotiation with the United States had also failed. The
negotiations at Batavia for acquisition of oil and other
vital materials had failed also; those negotiations had
terminated on 17th June 1940. Japan's reserves of war
supplies were in danger of being depleted. The decision
of the Imperial General Headquarters made in early April
1941 stood. The time for final preparation had now arrived.
<p>
The Japanese Navy began training and practice
for the attack on Pearl Harbor in late May 1941. Dive
bombing was practiced at Kagoshima, Japan, where the terrain
resembled that at Pearl Harbor. The development of
a shallow-water torpedo had been started early in 1941,
as the waters in Pearl Harbor were shallow. The Navy
spent considerable time in developing and experimenting
with that type of torpedo during the summer. Refueling
at sea was made a matter of special training in order to
permit the use of the more secure northern route of
approach to Pearl Harbor.

<center>
<h3>Cabinet Policy and Decisions of June and July 1941</h3>
</center>

OSHIMA, acting on instructions from his Government,
began discussions with Ribbentrop on 10th June 1941
which were to lead to the acquisition of additional naval
bases in southern French Indo-China for use in the attack
upon Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies. KIDO was
advised by Konoye of the decision of the Imperial General
Headquarters to attack Singapore and the proceedings
under that decision. On 21st June 1941, Matsuoka informed
the German Ambassador of the decisions, telling him that

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--923--</i></center><hr><a name=page924></a><p>
<blockquote>

the situation had become unbearable, that the negotiations
with the Netherlands Government were not to be resumed,
and that in order to attack Singapore and the Netherlands
East Indies, additional bases were required in southern
French Indo-China. He said that he had instructed OSHIMA
to inquire whether the consent of Vichy France could be
obtained by the German Government, and if not, he would
take the matter up directly with the Vichy French Government.
<p>
OSHIMA informed Konoye as early as 6th June
1941 that the German Government had decided to attack
the U.S.S.R. This information caused considerable confusion
among the Japanese leaders. There were some, including
Matsuoka, who considered it better for Japan to
postpone the attack to the South and emulate the role of
Italy in the European War by attacking the U.S.S.R. in
the rear at the opportune time in the German-Soviet
struggle for the purpose of seizing Soviet territories
in the Far East, thereby obtaining oil from Sakhalin.
There were others, including Konoye and KIDO, who argued
that the original plan of September-October to prosecute
the advance to the South should not be abandoned. Germany
attacked the U.S.S.R. on 22nd June. Acting upon
KIDO's advice, the Emperor instructed Matsuoka to conform
to Konoye's wishes, and KIDO and HIRANUMA repeated this advice.
<p>
The Liaison Conference of 25th June 1941, attended
by HIRANUMA, TOJO, MUTO and OKA and others, decided
that Japan would accelerate its measures towards French
Indo-China and Thailand. This was necessary in view of
the failure of the negotiations at Batavia. Naval and air
bases were to be established promptly in southern French
Indo-China and force employed if the French did not comply

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--924--</i></center><hr><a name=page925></a><p>
<blockquote>

with the Japanese demands. Preparations were to be made
for despatch of the necessary military forces before beginning
negotiations with France. These bases were needed
for the attack on Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies.
Konoye and the Chiefs of Staff reported these decisions
to the Emperor.
<p>
The decisions of the Liaison Conference show
that HIRANUMA, TOJO, MUTO, and OKA agreed with Konoye that
the fixed policy should not be changed. TOJO reported to
the Emperor on 28th June 1941. He told KIDO, later in
the day, that the Army's plan was for the time being to
remain neutral in the German-Soviet War, with the Kwantung
Army "remaining calm and prudent", and to strengthen the
Imperial General Headquarters by arranging for it to meet
every day in the Palace. SUZUKI had proposed measures for
strengthening the Imperial Headquarters on 23rd June. KIDO
had agreed with him, but advised that the Board of Field
Marshals and fleet Admirals should be consulted. DOHIHARA
was a member of the Board and was present when TOJO and
his Vice-Minister of War, KIMURA, appeared before the
Board on 30th June to express TOJO's views regarding the
fast-moving situation. Thus, the Military marshalled their
forces to prevent Matsuoka from upsetting their strategy
by his plan of postponing the move Southward and attacking
the U.S.S.R. at once, which he had outlined to the Emperor
on 22nd June 1941. The embarrassment caused by Matsuoka's
attitude and the necessity of his resignation was being discussed.
<p>
The Imperial Conference of 2nd July 1941, following
the Liaison Conference of 25th June, finally put the
question at rest. TOJO, SUZUKI, HIRANUMA and OKA< among
others, were present at that conference. The Conference
decided that, regardless of any change in the situation,

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--925--</i></center><hr><a name=page926></a><p>
<blockquote>

Japan would adhere to its plan for the domination of East
and South-East Asia, and would proceed with the Southward
advance, at the same time being ready to take advantage
of any favourable situation in the German-Soviet War to
attack the U.S.S.R. Necessary diplomatic negotiations
were to be continued while final preparations for the
attack upon Singapore and Pearl Harbor were being completed
and the Japanese forces were moving into position
in southern French Indo-China and Thailand for the attack.
Japan was to remain neutral in the German-Soviet War,
while secretly preparing an attack upon the Soviet Union
which was to be launched if and when it became apparent
that the U.S.S.R. had been so weakened by the war that
it would not be able to offer effective resistance. TOJO
was a strong advocate of this plan, and stated that, "Japan
would gain great prestige by attacking the U.S.S.R. at
a time when it is ready to fall to the ground like a
ripe persimmon".
<p>
The Army General Staff was ordered to proceed
with its final operational plans for the campaigns to
be waged in the Southern Areas. The troops which later
carried out landing operations in the Philippines and in
the Malay Peninsula began practicing landing operations
along the China coast, on Hainan Island, and along the
coast of French Indo-China, while others trained on Formosa.
The units which were to attack Hong Kong were given
rigorous training in night fighting and in storming pillboxes
at a station near Canton, China. Training areas
were selected at places where the terrain and climate
approximated to that of the area to be attacked. The
training continued all through the summer and until the
actual attack. Admiral SHIMADA was in command of the
China Area Fleet while this training was in progress.

Three Japanese Army divisions were prepared
for action against French Indo-China. The Japanese Government
planned to demand that the Vichy French Government
grant permission to the Japanese Government to occupy
southern French Indo-China and to construct military bases
there. This action had been suggested to OSHIMA by Ribbentrop,
who considered it inadvisable for Germany to
make the demand. The Japanese plan was that the demand
would be made in the form of an ultimatum which was to be
followed by invasion if the demands were not granted.
The demands were to be made on 5th July 1941, but inquiries
by the British and American Ambassadors revealed that
the plan had leaked out, and KIDO recorded in his diary
that in view of that fact, it had been decided to postpone
issuance of the ultimatum for five days in order to observe
what moves, if any, the British and Americans would
make to resist the ultimatum. The American and

British Ambassadors were given a flat denial of any
intentions to advance into southern French Indo-China.
<p>
Matsuoka instructed the Japanese Ambassador
to Vichy France on 12th July 1941 to serve the
ultimatum and demand an answer on or before 20th July.
The next day, Konoye in a personal message to Marshal
Petain assured the Marshal that Japan would respect
the sovereign rights of France in French Indo-China
if the Japanese Army were allowed to base there and
establish naval bases on the sores. Before an answer
to the ultimatum was received, the Second Konoye
Cabinet resigned because of disagreement between
Konoye and Matsuoka regarding the strategy to be employed.

<center>
<h3>Third Konoye Cabinet</h3>
</center>

Following the Imperial Conference of 2nd
July 1941, Matsuoka was not easily reconciled to the
decision of the Conference and did not act completely
in accord with it.
<p>
MUTO and OKA, as Chiefs of the military
Affairs Bureau and the Naval Affairs Bureau respectively,
had drawn up a formula which would insure
continuation of the negotiations with America by
making additional proposals. Konoye had agreed to
continue with Matsuoka as his Foreign Minister provided
Matsuoka would cooperate in applying the MUTO-OKA
formula. Matsuoka said he had no objection to the
formula, but at the same time, he insisted on rejecting
Mr. Hull's statement to Nomura of 21st June 1941
as being disgraceful to Japan. This was the statement
in which Mr. Hull had said that before proceeding with
the negotiations, the United States must await some

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--928--</i></center><hr><a name=page929></a><p>
<blockquote>

clearer indication than had yet been given that the
Japanese Government desired to pursue a course of peace.
Matsuoka proposed to present the MUTO-OKA proposals
only after Mr. Hull's statement had been specifically
rejected. Konoye was fearful lest this action might
cause the United States to refuse to negotiate further,
and insisted that Matsuoka send the counter-proposals
drafted by MUTO and OKA to Nomura, along with the
instructions for rejection of Mr. Hull's statement, so
that the danger of termination of the negotiations
might be reduced. Matsuoka disregarded Konoye's advice
and in the instructions he issued to Nomura acted
on his own view, thus precipitating a Cabinet crisis.
KIDO, upon learning of the crisis, was determined to
preserve the Konoye Cabinet for the execution of the
decisions reached at the Imperial Conference of 2nd
July 1941, and conferred with members of the Imperial
Household and with the Emperor upon a plan to return
the Imperial Mandate to Konoye if the Cabinet should
resign en bloc. KIDO recommended that Matsuoka be
asked to resign. Konoye vetoed that suggestion lest
Matsuoka and his followers make political capital of
his forced resignation by suggesting that it had been
dictated by America. The Konoye Cabinet accordingly
resigned en bloc on 16th July 1941 and the Emperor
ordered KIDO to summon the Jushin, a body composed of
former Prime Ministers acting as Senior Statesmen, together
with the President of the Privy Council, to
recommend Konoye's successor.
<p>
On 17th July 1941, KIDO conferred with the
Senior Statesmen upon Konoye's resignation statement.
Wakatsuki, Abe, Okada, Hayashi, Yonai and HIROTA were

<p><center><i>--929--</i></center><hr><a name=page930></a><p>
<blockquote>

present. The view was expressed that Konoye would
be able to unite all political circles behind the
Military, and the meeting was unanimous that he should
be recommended to the Emperor. The Emperor summoned
Konoye and delivered the Imperial Mandate to him to
form a new Cabinet. The third Konoye Cabinet was formed
on 18th July. Toyoda became Foreign Minister, TOJO
remained as War Minister, HIRANUMA became Minister
without Portfolio, and SUZUKI remained as President
of the Planning board and Minister without Portfolio.
KIMURA remained as Vice-Minister of War. MUTO and OKA
continued in their positions. The new Foreign Minister
declared that there would be no change in policy as
a result of the Cabinet change.

<center>
<h3>Occupation of Southern French Indo-China</h3>
</center>

OSHIMA handed Ribbentrop a memorandum
on the Japanese ultimatum to the Vichy French Government
on 19th July 1941, explaining that the ultimatum
had been delivered in order to secure military bases
in French Indo-China as the first step in the "push
to the South", meaning thereby the attack upon
Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies. he requested
the German Government to advise the Vichy
Government to accept the ultimatum and meet the demands
of the Japanese Government. Toyoda advised the German
Ambassador in Tokyo on 20th July that the Cabinet
change would not affect the policy decision reached at
the Imperial Conference on 2nd July. After reporting
to Germany the terms of the ultimatum with the statement
that it had no alternative but to give in to
violence, Vichy France accepted the Japanese ultimatum
and agreed to the Japanese demands. 40,000 troops
sailed on 24th July to take up the occupation of
Southern French Indo-China and the

<p><center><i>--930--</i></center><hr><a name=page931></a><p>
<blockquote>

construction of eight air bases near Saigon and of
naval bases at Saigon and Camranh Bay, in accordance
with the agreement. The formal agreement was ratified
on 28th July and signed the next day. TOJO, MUTO,
SUZUKI and OKA were present at the meeting of the
Privy Council on 28th July and represented the Cabinet
as explainers of the agreement. TOJO stated that
the agreement was one of the measures decided at the
Imperial Conference of 2nd July based upon the decision
of the Liaison Conference of 25th June, that the
Cabinet and the Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff were
united and were holding Liaison Conferences almost
every day in the Palace in order to take appropriate
measures under the Cabinet's strategic policy.

<center>
<h3>Further Discussions With United States of America</h3>
</center>

Ambassador Nomura had warned on 3rd July and
19th July 1941, in telegrams to the Foreign Minster,
that when the advance to the South commenced, there would
be danger that diplomatic relations between
Japan and the United States might be severed by the
United States Government. The American Acting
Secretary of State, Mr. Welles, inquired of Nomura
on 23rd July the meaning of the demands upon Vichy
France; and in reply to Nomura's explanation that
Japan needed to secure an uninterrupted supply of
raw materials and insure against military encirclement,
he stated that the agreement which had been
under discussion between the Japanese and American
Governments would give Japan far greater economic
security than would the occupation of French Indo-China.
He added the United States Government considered
the occupation as notice that Japan "was taking the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--931--</i></center><hr><a name=page932></a><p>
<blockquote>

last step to proceeding on a policy of expansion and
conquest in the region of the South Seas," and
that he had been instructed to say that the Secretary
of State could see no basis for pursuing further the
conversations with the Japanese Ambassador. The next
day, the American State Department issued to the Press
a statement that by the course the Japanese Government
had followed and was following in Indo-China, it was
giving a clear indication of determination to pursue
an objective of expansion by force or threat of force
and that there was no apparent reason which warranted
the occupation of French Indo-China other than a desire
for military bases to be used in the conquest of adjacent areas.
<p>
The President of the United States proposed
to the Japanese Government on 24th July 1941 that
French Indo-China be regarded as a neutralized zone,
Japan being given full opportunity of assuring for
herself food supplies and other raw materials she
was seeking, but the proposal was rejected. On 25th
July, the President issued a directive freezing all
Japanese and Chinese assets in the United States. Japan's
actions towards Indo-China were regarded as creating
a great risk of war, compelling the threatened nations
to take steps to prevent their security being wholly
undermined. On 26th July 1941, Toyoda, the Japanese
Foreign Minster, explained Japan's actions towards
French Indo-China as being necessary to carry through
the China affair. He alleged also that Japan had
reports of an intended encirclement of French Indo-China
which would be a menace to the area which was
indispensible in prosecuting the China affair. No

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--932--</i></center><hr><a name=page933></a><p>
<blockquote>

evidence of any such intended encirclement of French
Indo-China or of any report thereof has been adduced
before us. The evidence is conclusive that Japan's
reason for advancing into southern French Indo-China
was the desire to secure bases for an attack upon
Singapore, preliminary to an attack upon the Netherlands
East Indies. These bases also threatened the
Philippines. When Singapore was in fact attacked,
troops from Saigon and planes from bases in southern
French Indo-China took part in the attack. Britain
and the Netherlands issued similar freezing orders
on 26th and 28th July respectively. On 8th August,
after the freezing order was issued by the United
States Government, Nomura inquired of the American
State Department whether it might be possible for the
responsible heads of the two Governments to meet with
a view to discussing means for reaching ad adjustment
of relations. After reviewing briefly the steps which had
led to a discontinuance of the informal negotiations
between him and Nomura, the Secretary of State said
that it remained with the Japanese Government to decide
whether it could find means of shaping its policies
along lines which would make possible an adjustment
of views.

<center>
<h3>Supply Problems</h3>
</center>

OSHIMA learned of the slowing down of the
German advance into Russia at the end of July 1941,
which information gave the Japanese Imperial General
Headquarters considerable concern, for it was realized
that Japan's supply of accumulated war materials was
not sufficient to wage war against the U.S.S.R.,
the United States and Great Britain at the same time.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--933--</i></center><hr><a name=page934></a><p>
<blockquote>

It was feared the U.S.S.R. might assist the
United States by giving the United States military
bases in Soviet territory if Japan should attack
the United States of America. this possibility was
discussed between the Japanese Foreign Minister and
the Soviet Ambassador in early August 1941.
<p>
Towards the end of July 1941, the Emperor
called the Naval Chief of Staff for consultation on
the subject of Japan's policy with the United States.
Nagano, the Chief of Staff, informed the Emperor that he
was opposed to the Tripartite Alliance and believed
that so long as it existed it would be impossible to
adjust relations between Japan and the United States
of America. If the relations could not be adjusted
and Japan was cut off from oil, in case of war with
the United States of America, Japan's oil supply would
be sufficient for only one and half years. There
would be no alternative but to take the initiative
in operations. The Emperor asked Nagano if it would
be possible to win a sweeping victory. Nagano replied
that it was doubtful if Japan would win.
<p>
The Emperor expressed anxiety to KIDO about
having to wage a desperate war, but KIDO reassured
the Emperor by saying that the opinion of the Chief
of Staff was too simple. He said that Japan was not
without means of restoring the friendship between the
United States of America and Japan. He stated, however,
that he would ask the Prime Minister to give
careful consideration ot the questions raised by
the Navy Chief of Staff. KIDO and Konoye considered
the questions on 2nd and 7th August 1941. KIDO outlined
in his diary the points advanced by the Navy

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--934--</i></center><hr><a name=page935></a><p>
<blockquote>

in its argument against proceeding with the attack.
The Navy had expected to obtain oil from Sakhalin
and the Netherlands East Indies to replenish its
supply in case the war should be prolonged. Now there
was a possibility that the U.S.S.R. would become allied
with the United States, thus preventing the acquisition
of oil from Sakhalin. The risk involved in depending
upon the capture of the oil installations in the
Netherlands East Indies intact, and upon the transportation
of the oil over great stretches of submarine-infested
waters which might be patrolled by aircraft
based in Soviet territories was entirely too great.
The Army did not agree with the Navy and maintained
that the accumulated supply of oil would be sufficient
to ensure victory. Konoye and KIDO agreed that the
situation was serious and that it was necessary to have
an agreement between the Army and navy without loss
of time.

<h3>Further Discussions With United States of America</h3>
</center>

Ambassador Nomura's suggestion of 26th
July 1941, following the American freezing order of
the 25th, that the heads of the two Governments should
meet in an effort to adjust relations was renewed on
orders of his Government on 7th August, and was
welcomed by the Government of the United States.,
Accordingly, on 17th August, while the Japanese Army
and Navy Chiefs canvassed the subject of oil to supply
the Japanese Navy in a war with the United States, the
President replied to Nomura's suggestion. He said that
if the Japanese Government were in a position to embark
upon a peaceful programme along the lines
suggested by the principles stated by Mr. Hull, the
United States Government would be pleased to resume the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--935--</i></center><hr><a name=page936></a><p>
<blockquote>

informal discussions and endeavour to arrange a
suitable time and place for the heads of the two
Governments to exchange views. The President referred
to the circumstances in which the discussions had
been interrupted and said it would be helpful before
proceeding with plans for a meeting, if Japan would
furnish a clear statement as to its present attitude
and plans. The President further stated to Nomura
that nothing short of complete candour would further
the objective. If Japan took any further steps in
pursuance of a policy of military domination by force
or threat, the United States of America would be
compelled to take steps immediately to safeguard the
rights, interests, safety and security of the United
States and its nationals.
<p>
The Total War Research Institute had been
studying the question of negotiations with the United
States, and during the first half of August 1941
suggested a solution: "To the proposal of America,
we shall neither give our word clearly concerning
the position of Japan, but adopt a delaying policy
by diplomatic negotiations, repleting war preparations
in the meantime."
<P>
Konoye addressed a letter to the President
on 27th August 1941, in which he stated that he believed
that the deterioration of relations between the two
countries was largely due to a lack of understanding,
and that he desired to meet the

<p><center><i>--936--</i></center><hr><a name=page937></a><p>
<blockquote>

President personally for a frank exchange of views.
He suggested that they meet first and discuss from
a broad standpoint all important problems before
a formal negotiation of an agreement. At the same
time, a statement from the Japanese Government was
also presented to the President. In this, the
Japanese Government said it welcomed the invitation
to an exchange of views, that Japan was ready for
peace and would be proud to make sacrifices to
obtain peace in the Pacific. It said that Japan's
action in French Indo-China was intended to hasten
settlement of the China Incident, to remove all
menace to the peace of the Pacific and to secure to
japan an equitable supply of essential materials.
it said also that Japan did not intend to threaten
other countries and was prepared to withdraw its troops
from French Indo-China aas soon as the China Incident
was settled or a just peace established in East Asia,
and that Japan's action in French Indo-China was not
preparatory to a military advance into neighbouring
territories. The statement continued that the Government
of Japan was willing to restrict the discussions
to proposals which were in conformity with the basic
principles to which the United States had long been
committed, as the national policy long cherished by the
Japanese Government was in full accord on that point.
<p>
Japan's statements in regard to French Indo-China
were false. We now know that Japan's motive for
quartering troops and seizing bases in southern French
Indo-China in July 1941 was the desire to secure a base
and jumping off place for her intended attack on Malaya

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--937--</i></center><hr><a name=page938></a><p>
<blockquote>

and the Netherlands East Indies. It had nothing to do
with the so-called "China Incident". Japan was proposing,
as we now know, that she should retain this
base for attack on Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies,
which was also a threat to the Philippines and the sea
lanes, until her demands on China were satisfied, or until
"a just peace" was established in East Asia, an event
the occurrence of which she alone would determine, for
no other criterion for its determination was suggested.
This statement is founded on by the defense as amounting
to Japan's agreement that the four principles stated
by Mr. Hull would be given effect to. If any clear
representation by Japan to that effect can be read out
of the statement, it is now proved that at that time the
leaders of Japan had no intention of living up to such
representation.
<p>
The President replied to Konoye's letter and 
his Government's statement on 3rd September 1941.
He said that he noted with satisfaction Konoye's expressed
desire for peace in the Pacific and his Government's
statement that its long cherished national policy was in
accord with the principles to which the United States
Government had long been committed. The President
stated that he could not avoid taking cognizance, however,
of indications in some quarters in Japan of support of
concepts which would seem capable of raising obstacles
to successful collaboration between Konoye and the
president along the lines proposed. He therefore, suggested
that it would seem highly desirable to take precautions
toward ensuring success for their proposed meeting by
entering immediately upon preliminary discussions of
the fundamental questions on which they sought agreement.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--938--</i></center><hr><a name=page939></a><p>
<blockquote>

The President requested an indication of the Japanese
Governments' attitude regarding those fundamental questions.
<p>
Meantime, from the month of August onward, the
Japanese General Staff had been advocating an immediate
breaking off of negotiations and the opening of hostilities.
Konoye was opposed to this and held repeated conversations
with the Army and Navy Ministers and others, in which he
sought to counter this policy.
<p>
Immediately upon receipt of the President's
letter on 5th September 1941, Konoye called a Cabinet
meeting. TOJO opposed the proposed meeting of Konoye and
the President. he testified before this Tribunal that
his reason for doing so was that the President expressed
reluctance to meet with Konoye unless an agreement was
first reached covering all the essential matters. The
Emperor asked Konoye many questions regarding the strategy
to be employed in a war with the United States and Britain.
Konoye advised the Emperor to summon the Chiefs of Staff
of the Army and Navy to answer those questions, and
KIDO seconded that advice.

<h3>Imperial Conference 6th September 1941</h3>
</center>

The Imperial Conference met on 6th September 1941
with TOJO, SUZUKI, MUTO, OKA and other present. The
Conference decided that Japan should advance to the
South, that an effort should be made to obtain Japan's
demands through negotiations with the United States and
Great Britain, but that, if those demands were not fulfilled
by the beginning of October, a decision on the opening of
hostilities would be made. The demands which Japan desired
to see fulfilled were also decided at that Conference and
were as follows:
<blockquote>
Japan's minimum demand to be fulfilled
in her negotiations with the United States (Britain),
and the limit Japan is able to come to an

</blockquote>
<P>
One cardinal vice in this decision is the
proposal that Japan should be left controlling the
economy of China for her own ends, as had been achieved
by the agreement Japan had made with the puppet government
of China, and that America and Britain should withdraw
all military and economic support from the
legitimate government of China, which had long been the
victim of Japan's aggression, which support these countries
were quite entitled to give. If Japan had revealed that
this was her "minimum demand to be fulfilled in her negotiations
with the United States of America and Britain",
it is not too much to say that these negotiations would
have proceeded no further. This "minimum demand" was
in vital conflict with the four principles which Mr. Hull
had stated, upon the observance of which he insisted
throughout the negotiations.

<h3>Continued Preparations for War</h3>
</center>

The Chief of the Army General Staff instructed
his Chief of Operations, immediately after this Imperial

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--942--</i></center><hr><a name=page943></a><p>
<blockquote>

Conference, to intensify his plans and preparations for
war. Because of the practices governing the relationship
between the War Ministry and the General Staff,
War Minister TOJO, Vice-Minister of War KIMURA, Chief
of the Military Affairs Bureau, MUTO, and Chief of the
Naval Affairs Bureau, OKA, must have known and assisted
in the preparations being made.
<p>
The training for the attack upon Pearl Harbor,
and the training along the China coast for the landing
operations against Malaya, the Philippines and the
Netherlands East Indies and Borneo were drawing to a
close. Admiral SHIMADA, Commander-in-Chief of the China
Area Fleet, was transferred to command the Yokosuka
Naval District near Tokyo and was appointed a member of
the Naval Officers' Council on 1st September. The final
"War Games" of Naval Staff Conferences to work out
details for the operation, in which a large number of
high-ranking naval officers participated, were held at
the Naval War College in Tokyo between 2nd and 13th
September 1941. The problems to be solved were two:
first, the problems of working out the details of the
carrier attack upon Pearl Harbor, and second, the
problem of establishing a schedule of operations for the
occupation of Malaya, Burma, the Netherlands East Indies,
the Philippines and the Solomon and Central Pacific
Islands. The solution of these problems as worked
out constituted the basis of Combined Fleet Secret
Operations Order NO. 1, which was later issued.
<p>
The Foreign Minister, Toyoda, whose Consul-General
at Hawaii was engaged in espionage, arranged a
code on 24th September for transmitting secret reports
on the American Fleet in Hawaiian waters.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--943--</i></center><hr><a name=page944></a><p>
<blockquote>

Internal preparations for the attack continued
at a rapid pace. TOJO made a survey of the preparations
and reported on that survey to KIDO on 11th September.
The Cabinet adopted a "Workers Mobilization Plan" which
had been devised jointly by SUZUKI's Planning board and
the Welfare Ministry for increasing production of
munitions. The Inspector General of Military Education
issued training manuals on landing operations and
identification of Allied planes. TOJO's War Ministry
prepared operation maps for Singapore and Hawaii.
The Cabinet Printing Bureau continued printing occupation
currency in pesos, dollars and guilders for use in
the Philippines, Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies.

<h3>Talks With United States of America Continued</h3>
</center>

Konoye, on 6th September, the day of the
imperial Conference just referred to, and notwithstanding
the contrary nature of the decisions of that conference,
told the American Ambassador that he fully subscribed
to the four principles which Mr. Hull and the President
of the United States had enunciated. The next day]
in Washington, Ambassador Nomura presented a new Japanese
draft proposal to the United States Government which was
apparently intended as a basis for the commencement of
the preliminary negotiations to which the President had
referred in his letter to Konoye on 3rd September. The
essence of that draft proposal was that Japan would not
"without any justifiable reason" make further military
moves to the South and would interpret her obligations
under the Tripartite Pact "by the concepts of protection
and self-defence" without consideration of the views of
the other Axis Governments. The United States was to
cease giving aid to China, assist Japan in negotiating

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--944--</i></center><hr><a name=page945></a><p>
<blockquote>

peace with China on Japanese terms, agree to cooperate
with Japan in the acquisition and development of
natural resources in the Southern areas, and suspend
military measures in the Far East and in the South
Western Pacific Area. Japan had refused to withdraw her
troops from French Indo-China. This draft proposal reaffirmed
japan's' intention to adhere to the Tripartite
Pact, for Japan refused to give, or evaded giving, her
assurance that she would not attack the United States
under the terms of that Pact. the subsequent negotiations
revealed the peace terms for China s founded on the
Konoye principles, which would have given Japan economic
domination of China enforced by Japanese troops stationed
in China, and as providing for the recognition by China
of Japan's seizure of Manchuria.
<p>
The acceptance of this proposal by the United
States would have secured the Japanese Government its
objective as decided on 3rd October 1940. That this
was the intention of the Japanese government is revealed
by Toyoda, who instructed Nomura on 13th September 1941,
that his Government was not prepared, as he expressed
it, "to swallow" the four American principles. The United
States Government considered that the draft proposal of
3rd September was unsatisfactory and inconsistent with
Konoye's letter and his Government's statement to the
president of 28th August 1941.
<p>
On 25th September 1941, the Japanese Government
presented to the American Ambassador in Tokyo a completely
new draft proposal and urged that an early reply be made.
The new draft did not indicate any modification of the
Japanese attitude on fundamental points. HASHIMOTO

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--945--</i></center><hr><a name=page946></a><p>
<blockquote>

declared in an article published in the <i>Taiyo Dai Nippon</i>
on 25th September, that there was no hope of adjusting
relations with the United States and Great Britain, and
that proper action for the Japanese Government was
clearly indicate din the Tripartite Pact, meaning thereby
direct action in conjunction with Germany and Italy. The
President of the Cabinet Information Bureau made a
speech in commemoration of the first anniversary of the
signing of the Tripartite Pact in which he said that
the real meaning of the Pact was clear from the Imperial
Rescript issued on the day of its conclusion. He declared
that, by that Pact, the leading position of Japan in the
establishment of the New Order in Greater East Asia was
definitely recognized and that whatever changes might
occur in the international situation, and whatever difficulties
Japan might encounter, there would be no change
whatever in the fact that the Pact constituted the keynote
of Japan's diplomacy.
<P>
The beginning of October, the time set by the
Imperial Conference of 6th September for the decision of
the opening of hostilities, was rapidly approaching,
but the Army and Navy were still contending as to whether
the Navy would be able to carry out its mission with
the existing supply of oil. TOJO was impatient of the
diplomatic discussions with America and insisted that the
attack should not be delayed. The Army leaders declared
that they would withhold the attack until 15th October,
but would wait no longer. Konoye and KIDO discussed the
question of disagreement between the Army and Navy on
the subject of oil reserves. Konoye declared that he
had no confidence so long as this disagreement existed,
and there was no choice for him to consider his

<p><center><i>--946--</i></center><hr><a name=page947></a><p>
<blockquote>

resignation if the Army insisted on starting the war
on 15th October. KIDO implored him to be prudent,
and called in SUZUKI for consultation.
<p>
Mr. Hull delivered to Nomura a complete review
of the negotiations on 2nd October. The review concluded
with a statement that the United States Government
had endeavoured to make clear that it envisaged a comprehensive
programme calling for the uniform application
to the entire Pacific Area of the principles which Mr.
Hull and the President had enunciated, but that the
japanese Government had indicated its intention to circumscribe
the application of those principles by qualifications
and exceptions. Mr. Hull then asked: "If
this impression is correct, can the Japanese Government
feel that a meeting between the responsible heads of
Government under such circumstances would be likely to
contribute to the advancement of the high purposes
which we have mutually had in mind?"
<p>
The impression was correct. As we have previously
noted, Toyoda, Japan's Foreign Minister, told
Nomura on the 13th September that Japan could not
accept the four principles. Nomura reported to Toyoda
on 8th October 1941 that the Americans insisted upon
the four principles as the basis on which relations
between the two countries should be adjusted, that they
had always felt that if conversations between Konoye and
the President were to occur, it would be necessary to have
a definite understanding that those principles would be
applied ot the problems in the Pacific, and that they
believed that, so long as there was disagreement on
that matter, it would be futile to discuss details. KIDO
and Konoye agreed after receiving this message that the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--947--</i></center><hr><a name=page948></a><p>
<blockquote>

prospects of an agreement were very discouraging; and
KIDO suggested that it might be necessary to reconsider
the decision of 6th September and postpone the attack
until Japan should be better prepared. KIDO suggested
that the termination of the China Incident was the first
consideration, meaning thereby the military defeat of China.

<center>
<h3>Decision for War -- 12 October 1941</h3>
</center>

War Minister TOJO, the Army Chief of Staff
and other Army leaders revealed in their discussion of
the subject with the German Ambassador in the first
days of October that they had signed the Tripartite
pact in order to carry out the advance to the South
and establish Japan in South East Asia, and that in
order to accomplished their purpose by defeating Britain,
it was necessary to keep America at bay and eliminate
the U.S.S.R. The Chief Secretary of the Cabinet discussed
the American negotiations with KIDO on 7th 
October 1941. He reported that the Army, under the
leadership of TOJO, was of the opinion that there was no
room left for the continuation of the parley with
America, but that the Navy held the opposite view. He
suggested that Konoye should talk to TOJO in an effort
ot promote a better understanding with the Navy, and then
call TOJO and the Navy Minister to a meeting with Konoye
and the Foreign Minister to secure cooperation between
the Army and Navy.
<p>
Konoye talked with TOJO, but TOJO insisted that
there was no hope for diplomatic success in the American
negotiations and that the Cabinet should make up its
mind for war. Konoye requested War Minister TOJO, Navy
Minister Oikawa, Foreign Minister Toyoda and President

<p><center><i>--948--</i></center><hr><a name=page949></a><p>
<blockquote>

of the Planning Board SUZUKI to meet at his residence
on 12th October 1941 for a final conference on the
question of war or peace. Before the conference, the
Navy Minister sent OKA to Konoye with the message that
the Navy was not ready for war with the United States,
but was prevented from saying so by its prior consent
to go to war, given at the Imperial Conference of 6th
September. Accordingly, he intended at the approaching
conference to leave the matter to Konoye, and that he
hoped Konoye would decide to continue the negotiations.
<p>
Konoye opened the meeting on 12th October
1941 by stating that at last the Ministers must decide
whether it would be war or peace and suggested that
they re-examine the possibility of success by diplomatic
negotiations. TOJO retorted that there was no hope
of success by continuing the negotiations. They Navy
Minister suggested that the decision of that question
should be left to the Prime Minister. TOJO declared
that, since all of the Ministers were responsible for
the decisions, it should not be left to the Prime Minister
alone. TOJO agreed to reconsider his determination
to break off the negotiations provided the Foreign
Minister would assure him of inevitable success by continuing
them. The Foreign Minister pointed out the
obstacles to an agreement between Japan and the United
States, and stated that the major obstacle was the presence
of Japanese troops in China. TOJO emphatically
declared that Japan could not yield on that point, and
that, due to the sacrifices she had made in the China
War, the Government must insist upon complete realization
of the Konoye principles. It was finally decided (1) that

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--949--</i></center><hr><a name=page950></a><p>
<blockquote>

Japan should not abandon the plan adopted in September
and October 1940, (2) that an effort should be made to
determine whether the negotiations with the United
States would be successful within the time to be set by
the Imperial Headquarters, and (3) that preparations
for the attack should not be discontinued unless that
question should be answered in the affirmative.
<p>
The Chief Secretary of the Cabinet reported
the results of the Conference to KIDO; and ther next day,
KIDO and SUZUKI, in discussing the Conference, came tot
the conclusion that Konoye should make further efforts to
promote and understanding between TOJO and the Navy Minister.
That night, Konoye summoned Toyoda to give a complete
report upon the Japanese-American negotiation.
Toyoda gave it as his opinion that Japan would inevitably
be forced to withdraw her troops from China in order to
reach an agreement with the United States. The next
morning, 14th October 1941, prior to the Cabinet meeting,
Konoye summoned TOJO, informed him that according to his
investigation there was no hope of obtaining Japan's
objectives through negotiating with the United States if
Japan insisted on retaining troops in China, but there
was some hope of success if Japan "yielded on the pretence
and took the reality". He tried to persuade
TOJO to agree to an abandonment of the plans for the
advance to the South and to concentration of Japan's efforts
on settlement of the China War. He pointed out the
apparent weakness of Japan and her Allies, and warned that
if Japan should attack the United States it would be a real
world war. TOJO answered that the sacrifices of Japan

<p><center><i>--950--</i></center><hr><a name=page951></a><p>
<blockquote>

in the China War were such that he could not agree to
Japanese troops being withdrawn from China even if it
meant his resignation from the Cabinet. Konoye then
requested that he repeat his statement at the cabinet
meeting. TOJO maintained his position before the
Cabinet meeting of 14th October, and the meeting adjourned
without reaching a decision.
<p>
MUTO attempted through OKA to persuade the Navy
Minister to declare whether or not the Navy was prepared
to proceed with the war, but MUTO was unsuccessful. Late
on the night of the 14th October 1941, TOJO despatched
SUZUKI to Konoye with a message to the effect that since
the Navy Minister would make no declaration in the matter,
nothing could be done, and that since the Cabinet was unable
to carry out the decision of the Imperial Conference
of 6th September, there was nothing left for them
to do but resign en bloc. He asked Konoye to inform
KIDO> Konoye in turn instructed SUZUKI to inform KIDO,
which he did the next morning. later in the day, Konoye
called on KIDO and told him that he would no longer continue
as Prime Minister because of the disagreement with
TOJO. TOJO had said that he did not wish to discuss
matters with Konoye as he was not sure he would be able
to control his anger. Konoye collected the letters of
resignation of his Ministers on the morning of the 16th
October 1941, and added his own, delivered them to the
Emperor over the objection of KIDO late in the afternoon
of that day.
<p>
Konoye's letter of resignation gives a vivid
explanation of the situation. He explained that, when
he organized the Third Konoye Cabinet to prosecute the
expansion to the South, it was his firm conviction
that his Cabinet's objective would be

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--951--</i></center><hr><a name=page952></a><p>
<blockquote>

obtained through negotiations with the United States
Government, and that although his expectations had
not bee realized to date, he still believed that
"If we take the attitude of yielding to her in
appearance but keeping for us the substance and
casting away the name", those objectives might be
obtained through the negotiations. Konoye said
that TOJO had been demanding that war be commenced
with the United States on 15th October in accordance
with the decision of the Imperial Conference of
6th September, and had given as his reason that
the situation had come to a point when no other
means could be found to obtain the Japanese demands.
Konoye declared that it was impossible for him to
accept the responsibility for plunging the Nation
again into a titanic war, the outcome of which
could not be forecast.

<center>
<h3>Tojo Becomes Prime Minister 18 October 1941</h3>
</center>

KIDO make a last minute appeal to TOJO
for harmony among the Cabinet members by explaining
that the country had a right to expect unity of
purpose and cooperation between the Army and Navy
before plunging into a war with the United States.
He suggested that the decision of the 6th September
to begin the war in the first part of October might
have been wrong and that it should be reviewed in an
effort to obtain complete agreement. TOJO agreed
with KIDO; but before KIDO could take further
action, Konoye had submitted the resignation of
his Cabinet.
<P>
KIDO immediately saw the Emperor and
discussed a successor to Konoye. KIDO recommended
either TOJO or the Navy Minister should be appointed.

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--952--</i></center><hr><a name=page953></a><p>
<blockquote>

The next morning, the Senior Statesmen assembled
with Watatsuki, Okada, Hayashi, HIROTA, Abe and
Yonai, among others, present. KIDO opposed a
suggestion of either Prince Higashikuni or Ugaki as a
successor to Konoye and suggested TOJO. He said
that the most important matters were the revision
of the decision of 6th September and the settlement
of differences between the Army and Navy. HIROTA
was among those who gave positive approval of
KIDO's suggestion that TOJO be Prime Minister,
none opposed it. Upon submitting the recommendation,
KIDO advised the Emperor to issue special instructions
to both TOJO and the Navy Minister. these special
instructions were discussed by KIDO with TOJO and
the Navy Minister in the anteroom after their
audience with the Emperor. KIDO told them that he
presumed that the Imperial message had just been
given them regarding cooperation. He understood
it to be the Emperor's wishes that in deciding
national policy it was necessary to investigate
domestic and foreign affairs more broadly and
deeply and to carry out an earnest study without
considering themselves bound by the decision of 6th
September. He then delivered to each of them
written instructions calling for cooperation
between the Army and Navy and especially calling
upon the Navy Minister to further that cooperation
more closely.
<p>
TOJO was promoted to General on 18th
October 1941, and given permission to remain on
active duty while serving as Prime Minister in
order that he might also serve as War Minister.
He held both of these position during the entire

term of his Cabinet. He also served as Minister of
Munitions and for short periods of time as Minister of
Education, Home Minister, Foreign Minister, and Minister
of Commerce and Industry. SHIMADA served as Navy

<h3>Preparations for War Carried on Under Tojo</h3>
</center>

TOJO carried on the plan decided in September
and October 1940. Under interrogation after the surrender
he was asked: "You explained that the policy after the
6th September (1941) Imperial Conference was on the one
hand to negotiate for peace and on the other to prepare
for war; did you continue that policy?" TOJO answered,
"Yes, I undertook the work as Premier".
<P>
The Japanese overseas intelligence service
was improved and extended after the TOJO Cabinet was
organized, particularly in the Netherlands East Indies,
in preparation for the capture of the oil installations in
those Islands. The <i>Kokusaku-Kenkyu-Kei,</I> or National
Policy Investigation Association, which had been in
existence since 1936, began to make plans and appointed a
"Committee for Administrative Measures" to devise plans
for administration of the Southern Areas which the
Japanese Government expected to occupy. Its first report
was forwarded to TOJO as Prime Minister in October 1941.
The Army and the Ministry of Overseas Affairs adopted the
plan. Additional invasion maps were prepared. The Army
and Navy began issuing plans and regulations for joint
operations, and the organization of the Southern Army,
which was later to have its headquarters at Singapore,
was completed and its commander selected. Its initial
headquarters was established at Saigon. The Corps in
training near Canton for the attack upon Hong Kong was
preparing intensively for the attack and, according to
captured diaries of its members, expected to complete its
training early in December.
<p>
SHIMADA and OKA were concerned with the plan
to attack Pearl Harbor. Discussions took place at the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--956--</i></center><hr><a name=page957></a><p>
<blockquote>

Naval War College regarding the plan. The Commander of
the Combined Fleet, Yamamoto, proposed to attack the
United States Pacific Fleet while it lay at anchor at
Pearl Harbor. Others advocated a waiting strategy,
which called for an attack upon the American Fleet if
and when it attempted to advance among the Japanese
fortified islands of the Pacific. Yamomoto threatened
to resign and secured the adoption of his plan. The
final plans were completed by 1st November 1941. These
plans provided for attacks against Pearl Harbor, Singapore,
and various other American, British, as well as Dutch,
possessions.
<p>
TOJO immediately upon the formation of his
Cabinet, began to act upon KIDO's advices as approved by
the Emperor "to investigate the domestic and foreign
affairs more broadly and deeply". A list of subjects
to be so investigated was completed in the latter half
of October. The list was entitled "Major Items to be
Re-Examined Concerning Essentials for the Prosecution of
National Policies". The list contained such subjects as:
"What is the future outlook of the European War Situation?",
"What is the outlook from the point of view of strategy
in regard to a war against the United States, Great
Britain and the Netherlands in the initial stage and when
protracted over several years?", "Assuming that we
initiate war in the Southern Regions this Fall, what
will be forthcoming as relative phenomena in the North?",
"What degree of cooperation can we induce Germany and
italy to give us in connection with the opening of the
war against the United States, Great Britain, and
Holland?", "Is it possible for use to restrict our
adversaries of the war to only the Netherlands, or

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--957--</i></center><hr><a name=page958></a><p>
<blockquote>

Great Britain and the Netherlands?", "Will it be possible
to attain within the shortest possible time our minimum
demand which was decided at the Imperial Conference of
6th September by continuing negotiations with the
United States?"
<p>
The foregoing subjects were assigned to
various Ministries and Bureaux for study, and the
Government conferred upon them with the Imperial General
Headquarters in a series of Liaison Conferences. These
Liaison Conferences were held almost daily as TOGO
explained to Nomura in Washington, "in order to lucubrate
"upon a fundamental national policy". The conferences
were regularly attended by TOJO, TOGO, SHIMADA, KAYA,
SUZUKI, HOSHINO, MUTO and OKA. HOSHINO, formerly Director
of the General Affairs Board of the puppet state of Manchukuo,
in which position he had worked with TOJO, and formerly
President of the Planning BOard in Japan, had been
selected as Chief Secretary of the Cabinet by TOJO because
of his long experience in economic planning, and had been
charged by TOJO to devote his main efforts to such activities
in cooperation with SUZUKI, whom TOJO had selected
to head the Cabinet Planning Board. HOSHINO also acted as
Recorder for the conferences. SUZUKI acted as liaison
between the conferences and the Lord Keeper of the Privy
Seal KIDO. MUTO as Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau acted as liaison
between their Ministries and the Army and Navy General
Staffs respectively.

<h3>Negotiations With United States of America Renewed</h3>
</center>

TOJO had selected TOGO as his Foreign Minister
primarily to conduct the negotiations with the United

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--958--</i></center><hr><a name=page959></a><p>
<blockquote>

States, Ambassador Nomura was uncomfortable and desired
to be relieved. He said in his communication to TOJO
on 23rd October, "I am sure that I, too, should go out
with the former Cabinet. I know that for some time the
Secretary of State has known how sincere I was, yet knew
how little influence I have in Tokyo. Nor do I imagine
that you all have any objections at the Foreign Ministry
now that I am already a dead horse. For me, it is
painful to continue in a deceptive existence, deceiving
myself and others". TOGO advised Nomura on 2nd November,
"We have carefully considered and discussed a fundamental
policy for the improvement of relations between Japan
and America; but we expect to reach a final decision at
the Imperial Conference on the morning of 5th November
and will let you know the result immediately. This will
be our Government's last effort to improve diplomatic
relations. When we resume negotiations, every aspect of
the situation makes it urgent that we reach a decision
at once. This is to be strictly kept for your information".
<p>
TOGO cabled Nomura again on 4th November. He
said that conference had followed conference, and at last
they were able to bring forth a counter-proposal for the
resumption of Japanese-American negotiations based upon
the unanimous opinion of the Cabinet and the Military.
He added, however, that this would be the last effort at
negotiation, that they had decided to gamble the fate of
their land on the throw of this die, and that if a quick
accord was not reached, the talks would be ruptured and
the relations of the two countries would be on the brink
of chaos. He declared that Japan was making her last
possible bargain. He instructed Nomura to follow his

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--959--</i></center><hr><a name=page960></a><p>
<blockquote>

instructions to the letter in conducting the negotiations
as there would be no room for personal interpretation.
He then impressed upon Nomura the importance of his
mission by stating that he was in a key position and that
the Cabinet was placing great hopes on his ability to
"do something good for our Nation's destiny". At that
point, he urged Nomura to think deeply and compose himself
and make up his mind to continue at his post.
<p>
TOGO, in his series of cables to Nomura
on 4th November, transmitted the counter-proposal which
had been decided upon. He said that the proposal was yet
to be sanctioned at the Imperial Conference scheduled for
the next morning, but that as soon as that sanction was
obtained, he would inform Nomura, and that he desired the
proposal presented immediately upon receipt of that
information. The proposal was designated "Proposal A",
and was in the form of an amendment of the Japanese
Government's proposals of 25th September, and was described
in the cable from TOGO to Nomura as an "ultimatum".
The proposal provided for a gradual withdrawal of Japanese
troops. The first withdrawal was to be from French Indo-China
and was to be made if and when a peace treaty should
be signed with the National Government of China. Upon
the signing of the peace treaty, troops would be withdrawn
from China, except in designated areas to be specified in
the treaty, whence they would be evacuated after a suitable
period. On the period of the stationing of troops in
these areas, TOGO told Nomura "Should the American
authorities question you in regard to 'the suitable
period' answer vaguely that such a period should
encompass 25 years". Regarding the Tripartite Pact,
the proposal renewed the Japanese Government's

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--960--</i></center><hr><a name=page961></a><p>
<blockquote>

determination not to give an assurance that Japan would
not attack the United States as provided by the Pact, but
the Japanese Government would make its own interpretation,
independently of the other Axis Powers, of its obligation
under the Pact. On the question of non-discrimination in
trade, Japan would agree to apply the principle provided
it would be applied universally throughout the world.
TOGO made it clear that while terms might be made with
American upon other matters, Japan would not yield on their
de,mand to station troops in China. Their sacrifices in
China over four years and the internal situation in Japan
made it impossible to yield upon this point. In other
words, Japan required America to condone the invasion of
China and to leave that country in servitude to Japan.
A "Proposal B" was also transmitted to Nomura to be
presented if no agreement could be reached on "Proposal A".
This will be dealt with later.
<p>
TOGO informed Nomura in his telegram on 4th
November that, in view of the gravity of the negotiations,
and in view of Nomura's request to be relieved, he was
sending Ambassador Kurusu as a Special Envoy to assist
him in conducting the negotiations, but that he was
carrying no new instructions. A few days later, TOGO
confided to the German Ambassador that Kurusu had been
instructed on the firm attitude of the japanese gOvernment
and that Kurusu had been given a definite time limit which
he could not cross. Nomura was instructed to make
arrangements for Kurusu to see the President of the United
States immediately upon his arrival.
<P>
The Cabinet imposed additional censorship
regulation on news dispatches and speeches which might
disclose Japanese war preparations and strategic activitities

<blockquote>

during the conduct of the negotiations.
<p>
An Imperial Conference was held on 5th November
1941, as TOGO had advised Nomura. TOJO, TOGO, SHIMADA,
KAYA, SUZUKI, MUTO, OKA and HOSHINO were present. The
policy to be pursued against the United States, Great
Britain and the Netherlands was decided upon. It was
decided to re-open the Japanese-American negotiations and
to offer the United States Government two proposition
in the alternative, which were designated as "A" and "B".
These were the propositions transmitted to Nomura the
day before. It was further decided that if neither of
these were accepted by the United States on or before
24th November, the Japanese government would notify the
German and Italian Governments of its intention to begin
the war against he United States and Great Britain and
call upon them to participate and to agree not to make
a separate peace. The decision contemplated using the
American Government for securing an agreement with Great
Britain if the American Government agreed to either of the

<p><center><i>--962--</i></center><hr><a name=page963></a><p>
<blockquote>

proposals.
<p>
Immediately after the conference on 5th November, TOGO
cabled Nomura that the proposals had been sanctioned at the
conference and that he was to begin the talks along the lines
given in the instructions of the day before. While arrangements
for signing any agreement must be completed by the 25th November,
Nomura was instructed to avoid giving the impression that a time
limit for agreement had been fixed by the Japanese or that the
proposal was of the nature of an ultimatum.
<p>
It was further decided at the Imperial Conference that
Thailand should be approached to permit passage of Japanese
troops through her territory. Japan would promise to respect
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Thailand. The bait
was to be held out to Thailand that Japan would consider giving
her part of Burma or Malaya. As to the Netherlands East Indies,
to conceal Japan's intentions, negotiations would be opened on
the subject of procuring essential materials for Japan. The
Philippines would be made independent after occupation, as would
also a portion of the Netherlands East Indies, while the rest
would be retained by Japan.
<p>
TOJO called upon KIDO immediately after the conference
and informed him of the decisions just mentioned, of the
formation of the Southern Army, and of the decision to send
Kurusu to Washington to assist Nomura. On 5th November 1941,
TOGO sent a further cable to Nomura making 25th November
positively the final date for signing terms with America.

<h3>Navy Order for Attack</h3>
</center>

The Commander of the Japanese Combined Fleets,
Yamamoto, visited the Chief of the Naval General Staff,
Nagano, in Tokyo on 34d November and gave his approval
to the final draft of the Combined Fleet Operations Order
which had been under preparation for months. The order
provided for the execution of the advance ot the South
by attacking Singapore and completing an enveloping
movement against the Netherlands East Indies in the manner
originally planned on 4th October 1940. It also provided
for the attack upon the Philippines which OSHIMA had
mentioned to Ribbentrop months before as being under preparation.
These attacks were to be covered by an attack
upon Pearl Harbor to destroy the United States Pacific
Fleet. The British and Americans were to be driven from
China by attacks upon Hong Kong and Shanghai, and other
incidental operations were included. The order read:
<blockquote>
The Empire is expecting war to break out with the
United States, Great Britain and the Netherlands. When
the decision is made to complete over-all preparations
for operations, orders will be issued establishing the
approximate date (Y-Day) for commencement of operations
(sic) and announcing 'First Preparations for War'.
</blockquote>
The order then continued with instructions that upon the
announcement of Y-Day, all fleets and forces, without further
special orders, would organize and complete battle
preparations, and when directed by their commanding officers,
the various fleets and forces would proceed to their
rendezvous and wait in readiness for the attack. The
order provided further: 
<blockquote>
The time for outbreak of war
(X-Day) will be given in an Imperial General Headquarters
Order. This order will be given several days in advance.

<h3>Proposal "A" Presented 7 November 1941</h3>
</center>

Ambassador Nomura presented his "<a href=../../Dip/PaW/246.html target=docwin>Proposal A</a>" to Mr.
Hull on 7th November. On 10th November, he read a memorandum
explaining that proposal to the President of the United States,
but the memorandum was vague and uncertain. on the day Nomura
was reading that memorandum, Vice-Admiral Nagumo, who was to
command the carrier task force in its attack upon Pearl Harbor,
issued his order to his task force to rendezvous at Tankan Wan
(Hitokappu Bay, Etorofu island, Kuriles). SHIMADA said that the
order directed all ships of the task force to complete battle
preparations by 20th November and proceed to the rendezvous under
strict security regulations. Combined Fleet Operation Order No.
3 of 10th November fixed 8th December as "X-Day". That was the
day when, after 0000hours, a state of war would exist.
<p>
On 12th November, Mr. Hull told Nomura that the Japanese
proposal was being studied and that he hoped to reply to it on
the 15th.
<p>
The United States Government was maintaining close
contact with the British, netherlands and Chinese Governments
during the conduct of the negotiations and there was an understanding
that if the Japanese government should agree to the four
basic principles which Mr. Hull and the President had enunciated,
those Governments would be consulted before any agreement would
be reached upon specific problems in the Far East and the Pacific
Area. Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared on 10th November,
in the course of a speech delivered in London: "We do not know
whether the efforts of the United States to preserve peace in the
Pacific will be successful. But, if they fail, I take this
occasion to say -- and it is my duty to say -- that should the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--966--</i></center><hr><a name=page967></a><p>
<blockquote>

United States be involved in a war with Japan, a british
declaration will follow within an hour". The British Ambassador
called upon TOGO the next day to explain his Governments' position.
During the course of the conversation, TOGO informed the
Ambassador that the negotiations had entered their final phase,
that Japan had made her final proposal, and that if the United
States rejected it, there would be no reason to continue
negotiations further.
<p>
The Liaison Conferences continued almost daily for the
decision of questions relating to the attack. The conference of
11th November decided upon the policy to overthrow quickly the
American, British and Dutch bases in the Far East, to establish
Japanese self-sufficiency, and at the same time to hasten the
surrender of the Chungking Regime. The plan was to concentrate
on Great Britain with the cooperation of the Axis Powers so as
to defeat that country first and then deprive America of her will
to continue the war. Japanese troops were moving into position.
The air units were assembling at Saigon for their attack upon
Singapore. The ships which were to make up the carrier task force
for the attack upon Pearl Harbor were sailing from Japanese ports
bound for their rendezvous at Tankan Wan.
<p>
The United States Government impliedly rejected the
"ultimatum" of "Proposal A" presented by Nomura on 7th November
when Mr. Hull delivered a memorandum to Nomura on 15th November
replying to that proposal. Mr. Hull pointed out that the
proposals regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops were indefinite
and uncertain, as they did not specify a time limit for
such withdrawal nor the areas to be evacuated. He said also that
the United States could not undertake that other Powers would
give universal application to the principle of non-discrimination
in trade. No reply was ever received to this memorandum. Nomura

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--967--</i></center><hr><a name=page968></a><p>
<blockquote>

had advised TOGO the day before that the United States Government
was determined to do everything possible short of war to stop
further Japanese military moves, either southward or northward;
and that, rather than yield on that point, they would not hesitate
to fight, as they had no intention of committing another mistake
like that of Munich.
<p>
After receiving the memorandum from Mr. Hull, TOGO
began final preparations for the attack. He cabled the Japanese
Consul-General in Honolulu to take extra care to preserve secrecy,
but to make his reports on ships in harbor at least twice a week,
as the situation was most critical. Nomura had asked for an
extension of time, but TOGO replied ot him on the 16th as follows:
"I set the deadline for the solution of these negotiations and
there will be no change". He instructed Nomura to press for a
solution on the basis of the proposals "A" and "B" and to do his
best to bring about an immediate solution. TOGO then turned his
attention to negotiation of an agreement with the German Government
not to conclude a separate peace in case Japan became
involved in war with the United States, regardless of the cause
of the war. The agreement was reached on 21st November.

<center>
<h3>Proposal "B" 20th November 1941</h3>
</center>

Special Envoy Kurusu arrived in Washington on 15th
November 1941, but he did not present any new proposals until he
and Nomura presented to Mr. Hull the alternative
"<a href=../Dip/PlanB.html>Proposal B</a>" on
20th November. This was the alternative which TOGO had transmitted
to Nomura on 4th November and which had been approved by
the Imperial Conference on 5th November. TOGO had instructed
Nomura not to present "Proposal B" until it became apparent that
an agreement could not be reached on "Proposal A". This
"Proposal B" was a completely new draft proposal and was not
intended as an amendment of prior proposals. It made no mention

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--968--</i></center><hr><a name=page969></a><p>
<blockquote>

of the Tripartite Pact, the question of removal of troops from
China, or the principle of non-discrimination in trade. Japan
offered to withdraw her troops from southern French Indo-China
upon acceptance of the proposals and to withdraw them from
northern French Indo-China upon negotiation of a peace treaty
with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek, or upon the conclusion of an
equitable peace in the Pacific. In return for these so-called
concessions, the United States was asked to agree not to
interfere with the negotiation of the peace treaty with generalissimo
Chiang Kai-Shek and to agree to furnish Japan with oil.
The proposal also provided for a mutual agreement to cooperate
in the acquisition and exploitation of natural resources in the
Netherlands East Indies and to cooperate in the restoration of
commercial relations to the situation existing before issuance
of the freezing orders.
<p>
The American Government arrived at the conclusion that
the Proposal B was not sincere in view of information contained
in Japanese messages which the American intelligence service had
intercepted and decoded, and in view of the fact that troops
withdrawn from southern French indo-China were to be maintained
in northern French Indo-China and on Hainan Island, whence they
could be brought back in a day or two. Japan proposed to maintain
the position she had seized vis-a-vis southern French Indo-China,
a position which threatened the countries to the south and
threatened the trade routes. The American Government considered
that acceptance of this proposal would amount to condonation of
Japan;'s past aggression and approval of unlimited conquest by
Japan in the future, as well as abandonment of the principles of
the United States of America and the betrayal of China.
<P>
Mr. Hull called a conference of the Ambassadors and
Ministers from Great Britain, Australia and the Netherlands on
the morning of 22nd November and asked for their opinions on the

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--969--</i></center><hr><a name=page970></a><p>
<blockquote>

Japanese proposals. This conference agreed that if Japan
sincerely desired peace and firmly intended to adhere to a
peaceful policy, they would welcome it and would be glad to
cooperate in resuming normal trade relations with Japan, but that
the proposals and statements of Japan's Ambassadors in Washington
seemed to be opposed to the statements of the Japanese leaders
and Press in Tokyo. The British and Dutch representatives agreed
to consult their Governments and to report their opinions to
Mr. Hull.
<p>
Mr. Hull met Nomura and Kurusu on the afternoon of
22nd November 1941. He informed them of the meeting held that
morning and of his expectation of a decision by the conference on
the following Monday, 26th November. Nomura and Kurusu pressed
for an expression of the American attitude independently of the
British and Dutch opinions. Mr. Hull replied that all of the
Powers concerned were anxious that the pressing problems in the
South Pacific be resolved, but from that viewpoint the latest
proposal was not sufficient. On 22nd November, TOGO cabled Nomura
that the 29th November was the latest date for the conclusion of
an agreement as "after that things are automatically going to happen".
<p>
Nomura and Kurusu met Mr. Hull again on 26th November.
Mr. Hull, after pointing out that the "Proposal B" violated the
four fundamental principles which he had enunciated early in
the negotiations and to which the United States of America was
committed, informed the Ambassadors that the American Government
was of the opinion that the adoption of the proposals would not
contribute to ultimate peace in the Pacific. Mr. Hull suggested
that further efforts be made to reach an agreement on the
practical application of these four fundamental principles.
With that object in view, he offered a new draft proposal which
in its essence provided for enforcement of the four fundamental

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--970--</i></center><hr><a name=page971></a><p>
<blockquote>

principles in the Far East, and which contemplated a multilateral
agreement among the United States of America, Great Britain,
China, Japan, the Netherlands, Thailand and the U.S.S.R. for
withdrawal of Japanese forces from China and for maintaining the
territorial integrity of that country.
<p>
The proposed agreement provided that Japan and the
United States of America, with a view to ensuring a lasting peace
in the Pacific, would declare (1) that they had no designs on the
territory of other nations, (2) that they would not use military
force aggressively, (3) that they would not interfere in the
internal affairs of other states, and (4) that they would settle
international disputes by peaceful processes. These were the
four general principles which Mr. Hull had stated as early as
16th April 1941, and which the United States of America had all
along insisted must be agreed upon in principle and applied in
practice. They were principles to which Japan had, prior to 1930,
repeatedly stated her adherence, but which she had since that
date often infringed in practice.
<p>
In the domain of international commerce, it was proposed
(1) that there should be no discrimination as between nationals
of different states, (2) that excessive restrictions on the flow
of international trade should be abolished, (3) that there should
be access without discrimination by the nationals of all states
to raw materials, and (4) that trade agreements between states
should ensure the protection of the interests of the populations
of countries which must import goods for consumption. these were
principles to which Japan in her dependence on international
trade and as a large importer of goods for consumption could
hardly object, and indeed there had already been agreement on
the substance of them in the course of the prior negotiations.
But the practical application of all the above principles was a
different matter. Japan had waged a war of aggression against China

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--971--</i></center><hr><a name=page972></a><p>
<blockquote>

for years, in the course of which she had possessed herself of
Manchuria, had occupied a large part of the rest of China, and
had controlled and diverted much of Chinese economy to her own
uses. She had no obtained the essential bases in French Indo-China
for, had made all the preparations for, and was poised to
launch a new series of predatory attacks upon her neighbors to
the South. She hoped that these would secure for her the booty
of her past aggressions and the further territories and
materials she required to make her dominant in East Asia and
the Western and Southern Pacific. The practical application of
the above principles would involve the surrender of the fruits
of her past aggression and the abandonment of her schemes for
further aggression towards the South.
<p>
From the beginning of the negotiations, the United
States of America had steadfastly insisted on an acknowledgment
of the principles she stated, and Hull had repeatedly called
attention to the necessity of working out the translation of
these principles into practice. In the early stages of the
negotiations, Japan had evaded giving an unequivocal declaration
of agreement with the principles. About the month of August
1941, Konoye succeeded after great difficulty in obtaining the
consent of the Military to his informing the United States of
America that Japan accepted the four principles. As we have
seen, this was a mere empty gesture. There was no intention to
apply the principles. The leaders of Japan had never been prepared
to give practical application to the principles, to surrender the
booty of the past and to abandon the booty in prospect. They had
carried on the negotiations in that knowledge, although they had
all along been warned by the United States of America that the
practical application of the principles was an essential to any
agreement. Some of them apparently hoped by a mixture of military
threat and diplomatic manoeuvre to persuade the United States of America

<p><center><i>--972--</i></center><hr><a name=page973></a><p>
<blockquote>

to relax the application of her principles so far at
least as to allow Japan to retain the dominant position
she had seized in Manchuria and China. They
were not certain that Japan would emerge victorious
from a war with the United States of America and the
Western Powers, and, if they could persuade these
powers to acquiesce in the position Japan had secured
in Manchuria and the rest of China, they were prepared
to abandon, for a while, the projected advance to the
South. Others of them did not believe that the Powers
could be so beguiled and only acquiesced in the protraction
of the negotiations until those who were more
hopeful should be persuaded that the beguilement was
impossible -- which would make for national unity -- and
until Japan's preparations for war should be completed.
<P>
In his note of 26th November, Hull detailed
certain measures which were essential if the principles
were to be acknowledged and put into practice. These
were (1) that there should be a non-aggression pact
among all the nations with interests in the Far East,
(2) that all these nations should reject preferential
treatment in their economic relations with
French Indo-China, (3) that Japan should withdraw her
armed forces from China and French Indo-China, and (4)
that Japan should withdraw all support from her puppet
government in China.
<p>
This suggested practical application of the
principles brought the leaders of Japan sharply face
to face with reality. They had never been prepared 
to apply the principles in practice and were not prepared
to do so now. Their preparations for war were now complete.
The fleet which was to strike at Pearl Harbor

sailed this day in the early morning. They unanimously
resolved to go to war and so to manipulate the diplomatic
exchange that their military forces would be
able to attack the armed forces of the United States
of America and Britain at the chosen points before
warning, through the breaking off of the negotiations,
could reach them.
<p>
Komura and Kurusu cabled TOGO that their
failure and humiliation were complete. On 27th November,
the Japanese Foreign Office instructed Kurusu not
to break off negotiations. TOGO telegraphed Nomura
and Kurusu on 28th November, He said, "In spite of the
efforts you two Ambassadors have made, it is surprising
and regrettable that such a proposal as the recent one
(Mr. Hull's proposal of 26th November) had been made
to Japan by the United States. It is impossible for
us to negotiate on the basis of their proposal. WIth
the submission of the Imperial Government's opinion
of the American proposal (which will be telegraphed in
two or three days) the situation will be such that
there will be nothing left but to practically drop
the negotiation. But, we wish you to refrain from
giving the impression to the United States that the
negotiation is broken off. Tell them that you are
waiting for instructions from your Government." On
the 29th November 1941, the Japanese Foreign Office
instructed Kurusu and Nomura to make certain representations
to the United States State Department but
to be careful not to say anything which could be construed
as a rupture of the negotiations. The Foreign
Office repeated this warning to the Japanese Ambassadors
in Washington on the 30th November.

KIDO had discussed the situation with the
Emperor on 19th November. He advised the Emperor that
if the war should be commenced merely because the time
limit for the negotiations had expired, it might subject
the Emperor to undue criticism and that, therefore, the
Premier should be ordered to convene another Imperial
Conference, in which the former Prime Ministers would be
allowed to participate, before giving his sanction to
commencement of the war. At a later conference between
KIDO and the Emperor on 26th November, they decided
that under the circumstances, another Imperial Conference
upon the war should be held. Accordingly, on the
morning of 29th November, the Jushin, or Council of 
Senior Statesmen, was convened in preparation for their
meeting with the Emperor later in the day. During the
morning session, TOJO, SUZUKI, SHIMADA, TOGO, and
KIMURA were present. TOJO explained the inevitability
of war with the United States. After an interval, the
Jushin and TOJO met with the Emperor, who heard each
man's opinion in turn. TOJO gave the Governments'
point of view. The discussion proceeded upon the theory
that war was inevitable, as TOJO had said, and HIRANUMA,
as well as the other members of the Jushin, with the
exception of HIROTA and Konoye, contented themselves
with giving advice based on that assumption.

Harbor was freely discussed. The form and substance
of the note to the Government of the United States rejecting
Mr. Hull's draft proposal of the 26th and implying
a rupture in the negotiations at Washington was
agreed upon. It was agreed that a declaration of war
would not be necessary. The time of delivery of the
note was discussed. TOJO said that there were various
theories advanced as to the time that should elapse
between the delivery of the note implying a rupture in
the negotiations and the actual attack upon Pearl Harbor.
He said that some thought an hour-and-a-half should be
the time allowed, and that other periods of time suggested
were one hour, thirty minutes, etc. All agreed
that the time of delivery of the note should not be
permitted to destroy the element of surprise in the
attack. MUTO said it was finally decided to allow the
Navy General Staff to decide upon the time to be allowed
between the delivery of the note and the beginning
of the attack; that the Navy General Staff was to
estimate when their operations would take place and
then notify the Liaison Conference of the time at which
the United States could be notified.

others. TOJO presided at the conferences; he explained
the purpose of the conference, and thereafter the Ministers

question of war or peace with the United States,
Great Britain and the Netherlands. The decision was
in favor of war. The record of that decision reads,
"Our negotiations with the United States regarding
the execution of our national policy, adopted 5th
November, have finally failed. Japan will open
hostilities against the United States, Great Britain
and the Netherlands." KIDO recorded in his diary:
"At 2 p.m. the Imperial Conference was held, and at
last, the war against the United States was decided
upon. At 4:30 p.m. the Prime Minister visited me to
discuss the Imperial Rescript to Declare War." The
next day, that is to say 2nd December, the Imperial
General Headquarters issued the order designating
8th December as X-Day, but as we have seen this date
had already been fixed by Combined Fleet Operations
Order No. 3 of 10th November 1941.
<p>
Admiral Yamamoto issued an order from his
flagship in Hiroshima Bay on 22nd November 1941, which
was directed to the carrier task force then in its
rendezvous at Tankan Wan. the order was to the effect
that the force would move out of Tankan Wan on 26th
November and proceed without being detected to
Latitude 40 degrees North, Longitude 170 degrees
West, so as to arrive there by 3rd December. Refueling
was to be carried out there as quickly as possible.
On the morning of 26th November, the carrier task
force steamed out of Tankan Wan, headed for its
refueling point. The force consisted of Japan's
six large aircraft carriers, as well as battleships
and destroyers and other craft. Admiral Nagumo had

Nothing further was necessary, for on 23rd November
he had issued detailed orders for the attack.

<center>
<h3>Termination of Negotiations With United States of America</h3>
</center>

In Washington, the peace negotiations were
continuing. President Roosevelt, Secretary Hull, and
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu held a conversation on
27th November 1941 from 2:30 p.m. for a period of
about an hour. After this interview, Kurusu attempted
to carry on a telephone conversation with a member
of the Japanese Foreign Office in Tokyo, in which he
displayed an ignorance of voice code but a surprising
knowledge of the plans of the TOJO Cabinet to use
the negotiations in Washington as a screen to cover
the attack upon the Allied possessions in the Pacific.
He was advised that the attack was imminent and that
he was expected to keep the negotiations going at
all costs, in effect,k that the appearance of continued
negotiations was to be maintained although "the date
set&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has come and gone". The United States was to
be prevented "from becoming unduly suspicious'.
<P>
At about 10 a.m. on 7th December 1941
(Washington time 8 p.m. 6th December), TOGO's message
to Nomura and Kurusu transmitting the note to be
delivered ot the United States Government in reply
to the United States draft proposal of 26th November
and implying a rupture in the negotiations began to
arrive in Washington. It was transmitted in several parts.
[The "<a href=../Dip/Fourteen.html target=docwin>Fourteen Part Message</a>" <i>--HyperWar</i>]
In one part, TOGO informed Nomura that,
"Although the exact time for presenting the note to

preparations should be made upon receipt of this
memorandum so that it can be carried out as soon as
instructions for such action are received".
<p>
President Roosevelt, in a final effort to
reach a peaceful settlement with the Japanese
Government, dispatched a personal message to the
Japanese Emperor. The message was sent to the
American Ambassador in Tokyo, Mr. grew, with instructions
to deliver it to the Emperor. This message
reached Tokyo at noon, and although its contents were
known to Japanese Officials in the course of the
afternoon, it was not delivered to Mr. Grew until nine
o'clock that night. As soon as he had decoded the
message, Mr. Grew called upon Foreign Minister TOGO
at 15 minutes after midnight on the morning of 8th
December 1941, and requested an audience with the
Emperor for the purpose of delivering the message;
but TOGO informed Mr. grew that he would present the
message to the Throne. Mr. grew took his leave at
30 minutes after midnight (Washington time 10:30 a.m.,
7th December 1941). By this time, the two countries
were at war, as the Naval Operations Orders already
referred to fixed 0000 hours of the 8th December
(Tokyo time) as the time at which "a state of war
will exist". The attack upon Kota Bharu commenced
at 1:25 a.m. and upon Pearl Harbor at 3:20 a.m.
(both Tokyo time). No satisfactory explanation of
the delay in delivering to Mr. Grew the President's
message to the Emperor was given to this Tribunal.
Whatever effect that message might have had was
precluded by this unexplained delay.

<h3>Pearl Harbor</h3>
</center>

The Japanese Task Force had proceeded to
carry out its operation orders as scheduled. One
hour after Mr. Grew had taken his leave of TOGO,
that is to say at 1:30 a.m., 8th December 1941
(Pearl Harbor time, 6 a.m., 7th December) (Washington
time, 11:30 a.m., 7th December), the planes which
were to deliver the first attack on Pearl Harbor took
off from the decks of their carriers at a point
approximately 230 miles north of Pearl Harbor.
Ambassador Nomura in Washington had asked for an 
appointment to see Secretary Hull at 3 a.m., 8th
December 1941) Washington time, 1 p.m., 7th December),
but he later telephones and asked that the appointment
be postponed to 3:45 a.m., 8th December 1941)
(Washington time, 1:45 pm., 7th December). Before
Nomura called upon Mr. Hull, the first assault upon
Pearl Harbor was delivered at 3:20 a.m., 8th December
1941 (Pearl Harbor time, 7:50 a.m., 7th December)
(Washington time, 1:20 p.m., 7th December). Ambassadors
Nomura nd Kurusu arrived at Secretary Hull's office
at 4:05 a.m., 8th December 1941 (Washington time,
2:05 p.m., 7th December), which was 45 minutes after
the first attack was actually delivered at Pearl
Harbor, and were not received by Mr. Hull until
one hour after the attack had begun. The Japanese
Ambassador stated that he had been instructed to
deliver his message at 3 a.m., 8th December 1941
(Washington time, 1 p.m., 7th December), but that he
was sorry that he had been delayed owing to trouble
in decoding and transcribing the message. The

Secretary asked why he had been told to deliver
the message at the specific hour of 1 p.m. Washington
time. the Ambassador replied that he did not know,
but that was his instruction. It is true that TOGO
had telegraphed instructions to Nomura on 8th
December 1941 (Washington time, 7th December), as
follows: "Will the Ambassador please submit to the

upon Pearl Harbor by horizontal bombers from 4:10 a.m.
to 4:45 a.m. (Pearl Harbor time, 8:40 a.m. to 9:15 a.m.),
and a third attack was delivered by dive bombers from
4:45 a.m. to 5:15 a.m. (Pearl Harbor time 9:15 a.m.
to 9:45 a.m.).

<center>
<h3>Kota Bharu</h3>
</center>

Forty-five minutes after Mr. Grew had taken his
leave of TOGO in Tokyo, that is to say at 1:25 a.m., 8th
December 1941 (Kota Bharu time, 11:45 p.m., 7th December)
(Washington time, 11:25 a.m., 7th December), the beach
defence troops on the Badang and Sabak Beaches on the
east coast of British Malaya, the point of junction of
which at Kuala Peamat is about one-and-a-half miles
northeast of Kota Bharu Airfield, reported ships anchoring
off the coast. TOJO said that these ships had sailed
from Saigon in French Indo-China. At 1:40 a.m., 8th
December 1941( Kota Bharu time, midnight 7th December)
(Washington time, 11:40 a.m., 7th December), these ships
began shelling the beaches. This was one hour and twenty
minutes before the time at which it had originally been
arranged that Kurusu and Nomura should call on Mr. Hull
with the Japanese note and two hours and twenty-five
minutes before they actually arrived at Secretary Hull's
office. About 2:05 a.m., 8th December 1941 (Kota Bharu
time, 12:25 a.m., 8th December) the first wave of
Japanese troops landed at the junction of Badang and 
Sabak Beaches. Having secured the first line of beach
defences, the Japanese began the second phase of their 
landing operations against the British Malaya Peninsula.
This second phase was a landing operation at Singora and
Patani, which towns were located just north of the

boundary between British Malay and Thailand, and were
therefore in Thailand. This second landing began at
3:05 a.m., 8th December 1941 (Kota Bharu time, 1:25 a.m.,
8th December) (Washington time, 1:05 p.m., 7th December).
Air reconnaissance revealed that the Japanese ships were
disembarking troops at Singora and Patani and that the
airdrome at Singora was under occupation by the Japanese
landing party. The Japanese forces later crossed the
Malaya-Thailand Border at Pedang Besar and at Kroh to
execute a flanking movement against Kota Bharu.
<p>
An air raid was made upon the City of
Singapore in British Malaya by Japanese planes beginning
at 6:10 a.m., 8th December 1941 (Singapore time, 4:30
a.m., 8th December) (Washington time, 4:10 p.m., 7th
December). These attacking planes came from bases
in French Indo-China according to TOJO and from carriers
off-shore. Bombs were dropped on the Seletar and Tengah
airfields, as well as on the city.

<h3>The Philippines, Wake and guam</h3>

The first attack on the Island of guam
was delivered at 8:05 a.m., 8th December 1941
(Washington time, 6:05 p.m., 7th December), when
eight Japanese bombers came through the clouds and
dropped bombs in the vicinity of the Cable Station

and Pan American compound.
<p>
During the early morning hours of 8th
December 1941 (Wake and Washington time, 7th
December), the attack began on Wake Island with
bombing by Japanese planes.
<p>
The Philippines received their first
attacks on the morning of 8th December 1941 (Washington
time, 7th December) also. Heavy bombing attacks
were made by the Japanese forces on the city of
Davao on the Island of Mindanao and on Clark Field
on the Island of Luzon.

<h3>Hong Kong</h3>
</center>

Hong Kong received its first attack at
9:00 a.m., 8th December 1941 (Hong Kong time,
8:00 a.m. 8th December) (Washington time, 7:00
p.m. 7th December). Although war had not been
declared against Great Britain, a broadcast from
the Tokyo Radio, which was in code and which
gave warning to the Japanese nationals that war
with Great Britain and the United States was
imminent, had been picked up by the authorities
at Hong Kong around 5:45 a.m. 8th December 1941.
This warning allowed the defenders of Hong Kong
to make some preparation for the expected attack.

were able to take over the Bund without difficulty.
They had taken complete possession of it
by 4:00 a.m., 8th December 1941 (Shanghai time,

<h3>The Japanese Note Delivered in Washington on 7th December 1941</h3>
</center>

<a href=IMTFE-B.html#B-16 target=docwin>Hague Convention No. III</a> of 1907, relative
to the opening of hostilities, provides by
its first Article "The Contracting Powers recognize
that hostilities between themselves must
not commence without previous and explicit
warning in the form either of a reasoned
declaration of war or of an ultimatum with
conditional declaration of war". That Convention
was binding on Japan at all relevant
times. Under the Charter of the Tribunal,
the planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of
a war in violation of international law, treaties,
agreements or assurances is declared to be a
crime. Many of the charges in the indictment
are based wholly or partly upon the view that
the attacks against Britain and the United States
were delivered without previous and explicit
warning in the form either of a reasoned declaration
of war or of an ultimatum with conditional
declaration of war. For reasons which
are discussed elsewhere, we have decided that it
is unnecessary to deal with these charges. In
the case of counts of the indictment which charge

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--985--</i></center><hr><a name=page986></a><p>
<blockquote>

conspiracy to wage aggressive wars and wars in
violation of international law, treaties, agreements
or assurances we have come to the conclusion
that the charge of conspiracy to wage
aggressive wars has been made out, that these
acts are already criminal in the highest degree,
and that it is unnecessary to consider whether
the charge has also been established in respect
of the list of treaties, agreements and assurances
-- including Hague Convention III -- which
the indictment alleges to have been broken. We
have come to a similar conclusion in respect to
the counts which allege the waging of wars of
aggression and wars in violation of international
law, treaties, agreements and assurances. With
regard to the counts of the indictment which
charge murder in respect that wars were waged
in violation of Hague COnvention No. III of 1907
or of other treaties, we have decided that the
wars in the course of which these killings
occurred were all wars of aggression. The waging
of such wars is the major crime, since it involves
untold killings, suffering and misery.
No good purpose would be served by convicting
any defendant of that major crime and also of
"murder" <i>eo nomie.</i> Accordingly, it si unnecessary
for us to express a concluded opinion
upon the exact extent of the obligation imposed
by Hague Convention III of 1907. It undoubtedly
imposes the obligation of giving previous and
explicit warning before hostilities are commenced,
but it does not define the period which

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--986--</i></center><hr><a name=page987></a><p>
<blockquote>

must be allowed between the giving of this warning
and the commencement of hostilities. The position
was before the framers of the Convention and
has been the subject of controversy among international
lawyers ever since the Convention was
made. This matter of the duration of the period
between warning and hostilities is of course
vital. If that period is not sufficient to allow
of the transmission of the warning to armed
forces in outlying territories and to permit them
to put themselves in a state of defence, they may
be shot down without a chance to defend themselves.
It was the existence of this controversy
as to the exact extent of the obligation imposed
by the Convention which opened the way for TOGO
to advise the Liaison Conference of 30th November
1941 that various opinions were held as to
the period of warning which was obligatory, that
some thought it should be an hour and a half,
some an hour, some half an hour. The Conference
left it to TOGO and the two chiefs of Staff to
fix the time of the delivery of the Note to
Washington with the injunction that that time must
not interfere with the success of the surprise
attack. In short, they decided to give notice that
negotiations were broken off at so short an interval
before they commenced hostilities as to
ensure that the armed forces of Britain and the
United States at the points of attack could not
be warned that negotiations were broken off.
TOGO and the naval and military men, to whom the
task had been delivered, arranged that the Note

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--987--</i></center><hr><a name=page988></a><p>
<blockquote>

should be delivered in Washington at 1:00 p.m.
on 7th December 1941. The first attack on Pearl
Harbor was delivered at 1:20 p.m. Had all gone
well, they would have allowed twenty minutes for
Washington to warn the armed forces at Pearl
Harbor. But so anxious were they to ensure that
the attack would be a surprise, that they allowed
no margin for contingencies. Thus, through the
decoding and transcription of the Note in the
Japanese Embassy taking longer than had been
estimated, the Japanese Ambassadors did not in
fact arrive with the Note at Secretary Hull's
office in Washington until 45 minutes after the
attack had been delivered. As for the attack on
Britain at Kota Bharu, it was never related to
the time (1:00 p.m.) fixed for the delivery of
the Note at Washington. This fact has not been
adequately explained in the evidence. The attack
was delivered at 11:40 a.m. Washington time, one
hour and twenty minutes before the Note should
have been delivered if the Japanese Embassy at
Washington had been able to carry out the
instructions it had received from Tokyo.
<p>
We have thought it right to pronounce
the above findings in fact, for these matters have
been the subject of much evidence and argument,
but mainly in order to draw pointed attention to
the defects of the Convention as framed. It
permits of a narrow construction and tempts the
unprincipled to try to comply with the obligation
thus narrowly construed, while at the same time
ensuring that their attacks shall come as a

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--988--</i></center><hr><a name=page989></a><p>
<blockquote>

surprise. With the margin thus reduced for the
purpose of surprise, no allowance can bge made for
error, mishap or negligence leading to delay in
the delivery of the warning, and the possibility
is high that the prior warning which the Convention
makes obligatory will not in fact be
given. TOJO stated that the Japanese Cabinet
had this in view, for they envisaged that the more
the margin was reduced, the greater the possibility
of mishap.
<blockquote>
<table border bgcolor=#a0a0a0 cellpadding=3>
<tr>
	<td>My apologies for the intrusion, but the preceding section strikes
		the editor as highly confusing: if the Note had been delivered an
		hour or day or even a year before the attack, it in no way constitutes
		a "reasoned declaration of war" <i>or</i> an "ultimatum with
		conditional declaration of war" as required by the Convention.
		It simply declares the existing negotiations at an impasse. The Note
		does not even declare a rupture in diplomatic relations, let alone
		threaten or declare war.

<h3>The Formal Declaration of War</h3>
</center>

The Japanese Privy Council's Committee
of Investigation did not begin the consideration
of the question of making a formal declaration
of war upon the United States, Great Britain and
the Netherlands until 7:30 a.m., 8th December
(Tokyo time), when it met in the Imperial Palace
for that purpose at that time. SHIMADA announced
that the attacks had been made upon Pearl Harbor
and Kota Bharu; and a bill declaring war on the
United States and Great Britain, which had been
drafted at the residence of HOSHINO during the
night, was introduced. In answer to a question
during the deliberations on the bill, TOJO declared
in referring to the peace negotiations at
Washington that, "those negotiations were continued
only for the sake of strategy". TOJO also
declared during the deliberations that war would
not be declared on the Netherlands in view of
future strategic convenience; and that a declaration
fo war against Thailand would not be made,

as negotiations were in progress between Japan
and Thailand for the conclusion of "an Alliance
Pact". The Bill was approved; and it was
decided to submit it to the Privy Council. The
Privy Council met at 10:50 a.m., 8th December
1941 and passed the Bill. The Imperial Rescript
declaring war against the United States and Great
Britain was issued between 11:40 and 12:00 a.m.,
8th December 1941 (Washington time, 10:40 p.m.
and 11:00 p.m., 7th December) (London time,
2:40 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., 8th December). Having
been attacked, the United States of America and
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland declared war on Japan on 9th December
1941 (London and Washington, 8th December). On
the same day, the Netherlands, Netherlands East
Indies, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,
Free France, Canada and China also declared war
on Japan. The next day, MUTO stated in a conversation
with the Chief of Operations of the Army
General Staff that the sending of Ambassador
Kurusu to the United States was nothing more than
a sort of camouflage of events leading to the
opening of hostilities.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
</center>

It remains to consider the contention
advanced on behalf of the defendants that Japan's
acts of aggression against France, her attack
against the Netherlands, and her attacks on Great
Britain and the United States of America were
justifiable measures of self-defence. It is

<p><center><i>--990--</i></center><hr><a name=page991></a><p>

argued that these Powers took such measures to
restrict the economy of Japan that she had no way
of preserving the welfare and prosperity of her
nationals but to go to war.
<P>
The measures which were taken by these
Powers to restrict Japanese trade were taken in
an entirely justifiable attempt to induce Japan
to depart from a course of aggression on which
she had long been embarked and upon which she had
determined to continue. Thus, the United States
of America gave notice to terminate the Treaty of
Commerce and Navigation with Japan on 26th July
1939, after Japan had seized Manchuria and a large
part of the rest of China, and when the existence
of the treaty had long ceased to induce Japan to
respect the rights and interests of the nationals
of the United States in China. It was given in
order that some other means might be tried to
induce Japan to respect these rights. Thereafter,
the successive embargoes which were imposed on
the export of materials to Japan were imposed as
it became clearer and clearer that Japan had
determined to attack the territories and interests
of the Powers. They were imposed in an attempt
to induce Japan to depart from the aggressive
policy on which she had determined, and in order
that the Powers might no longer supply Japan with
the materials to wage war upon them. In some
cases, as for example in the case of the embargo
on the export of oil from the United States of
America to Japan, these measures were also taken
in order to build up the supplies which were

<p><center><i>--991--</i></center><hr><a name=page992></a><p>
<blockquote>

needed by the nations who were resisting the
aggressors. The argument is indeed merely a repetition
of Japanese propaganda issued at the time she
was preparing for her wars of aggression. It is not
easy to have patience with its lengthy repetition at
this date, when documents are at length available
which demonstrate that Japan's decision to expand
to the North, to the West and to the South at the
expense of her neighbors was taken long before any
economic measures were directed against her, and was
never departed from. The evidence clearly establishes,
contrary to the contention of the defense, that the
acts of aggression against France, and the attacks
on Britain, the United States of America and the
Netherlands were prompted by the desire to deprive
China of any aid in the struggle she was waging
against Japan's aggression, and to secure for Japan
the possessions of her neighbors in the South.
<p>
The Tribunal is of opinion that the
leaders of Japan in the years 1940 and 1941
planned to wage wars of aggression against France
in French Indo-China. they had determined to
demand that France cede to Japan the right to
station troops and the right to air bases and
naval bases in French Indo-China, and they had
prepared to use force against France if their
demands were not granted. They did make such
demands upon France under threat that they would
use force to obtain them, if that should prove
necessary. In her then situation, France was compelled
to yield to the threat of force and granted

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--992--</i></center><hr><a name=page993></a><p>
<blockquote>

the demands.
<p>
The Tribunal also finds that a war of
aggression was waged against the Republic of
France. The occupation by Japanese troops of
portions of French Indo-China, which Japan had
forced France ot accept, did not remain peaceful.
As the war situation, particularly in the Philippines,
turned against Japan, the Japanese Supreme
War Council, in February 1945, decided to submit
the following demands to the Governor of French
Indo-China: (1) that all French troops and armed
police be placed under Japanese command, and 92)
that all means of communication and transportation
necessary for military action be placed under
Japanese control. These demands were presented
to the Governor of French Indo-China on 9th
March 1945, in the form of an ultimatum backed by
the threat of military action. He was given two
hours to refuse or accept. He refused, and the
Japanese proceeded to enforce their demands by
military action. French troops and military 
police resisted the attempt to disarm them. There
was fighting in Hanoi, Saigon, Phnom-Penh,
Nhatrang, and towards the Northern frontier. We
quote the official Japanese account, "In the
Northern frontiers the Japanese had considerable
losses. The Japanese army proceeded to suppress
French detachments which had fled to the mountains.
In a month public order was re-established except
in remote places". The Japanese Supreme War
Council had decided that, if Japan's demands were

<p><center><i>--993--</i></center><hr><a name=page994></a><p>
<blockquote>

refused and military action was taken to enforce
them, "the two countries will not be considered
as at war". This Tribunal finds that Japanese
actions at that time constituted the waging of a
war of aggression against the Republic of France.
<p>
The Tribunal is further of opinion that
the attacks which Japan launched on 7th December
1941 against Britain, the United States of America,
and the Netherlands were wars of aggression.
They were unprovoked attacks, prompted by the
desire to seize the possessions of these nations.
Whatever may be the difficulty of stating a
comprehensive definition of "a war of aggression",
attacks made with the above motive cannot but be
characterized as wars of aggression.
<P>
It was argued on behalf of the defendants
that, in as much as the Netherlands took
the initiative in declaring war on Japan, the war
which followed cannot be described as a war of
aggression by Japan. The facts are that Japan
had long planned to secure for herself a dominant
position in the economy of the Netherlands East
Indies by negotiation or by force of arms if
negotiation failed. By the middle of 1941, it was
apparent that the Netherlands would not yield to
the Japanese demands. The leaders of Japan then
planned and completed all preparations for
invading and seizing the Netherlands East Indies.
The orders issued to the Japanese army for this
invasion have not been

recovered, bu the orders issued to the Japanese
navy on 5th November 1941 have been adduced in evidence.
This is the Combined Fleet Operations Order No. 1
already referred to. The expected enemies are stated
to be the United States, Great Britain and the Netherlands.
The order states that the day for the outbreak
of war will be given in an Imperial General Headquarters
order, and that <u>after 0000 hours on that day a state
of war will exist</u> and the Japanese forces will commence
operations according to the plan. The order of Imperial
General Headquarters was issued on 10th November and
it fixed 8th December (Tokyo time), 7th December
(Washington time) as the date on which a state of war
would exist and operations would commence according to
the plan. In the very first stage of the operations so
to be commenced, it is stated that the Southern Area
Force will annihilate enemy fleets in the Philippines,
British Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies area.
There is no evidence that the above order was ever
recalled or altered in respect to the above particulars.
In these circumstances we find in fact that orders
declaring the existence of a state of war and for the
execution of a war of aggression by Japan against the
Netherlands were in effect from the early morning of
7th December 1941. The fact that the Netherlands, being
fully apprised of the imminence of the attack, in self
defence declared war against Japan on 8th December and
thus officially recognized the existence of a state of
war which had been begun by Japan cannot change that
war from a war of aggression on the part of Japan into
something other than that. In fact, Japan did not declare
war against the Netherlands until 11th January 1942

when her troops landed in the Netherlands East Indies.
The Imperial Conference of 1st December 1941 decided
that "Japan will open hostilities against the United
States, Great Britain and the Netherlands". Despite
this decision to open hostilities against the Netherlands,
and despite the fact that orders for the execution of
hostilities against the Netherlands were already in
effect, TOJO announced to the Privy Council on 8th
December (Tokyo time) when they passed the Bill making
a formal declaration of war against the United States
of American and Britain that war would not be declared
on the Netherlands in view of future strategic convenience.
The reason for this was not satisfactorily
explained in evidence. The Tribunal is inclined to
the view that it was dictated by the policy decided in
October 1940 for the purpose of giving as little time as
possible for the Dutch to destroy oil wells. It has no
bearing, however, on the fact that Japan launched a war
of aggression against the Netherlands.
<p>
The position of Thailand is special. The
evidence bearing upon the entry of Japanese troops
into Thailand is meagre to a fault. It is clear
that there was complicity between the Japanese leaders
and the leaders of Thailand in the years 1939 and 1490
when Japan forced herself on France as mediator in
the dispute as to the border between French Indo-China
and thailand. There is no evidence that the position of
complicity and confidence between Japan and Thailand,
which was then achieved, was altered before December
1941. It is proved that the Japanese leaders planned to
secure a peaceful passage for their troops through
Thailand into Malay by agreement with Thailand. They did

<p><center><i>--996--</i></center><hr><a name=page997></a><p>

not wish to approach Thailand for such an agreement until
the moment when they were about to attack Malaya, lest
the news of the imminence of that attack should leak out.
The Japanese troops marched through the territory
of Thailand unopposed

<p><center><i>--997--</i></center><hr><a name=page998></a><p>
<blockquote>

on 7th December 1941 (Washington time). The only
evidence the prosecution has adduced as to the
circumstances of that march is (1) a statement made to
the Japanese Privy Council between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.
on 8th December 1941 (Tokyo time) that an agreement
for the passage of the troops was being negotiated,
(2) a Japanese broadcast announcement that they had
commenced friendly advancement into Thailand on the
afternoon of the 8th December (Tokyo time) (Washington
time, 7th December), and that Thailand had facilitated
the passage by concluding an agreement at 12:30 p.m.,
and (3) a conflicting statement, also introduced by
the prosecution, that Japanese troops landed at
Singora and Patani in Thailand at 3:05 in the morning
of 8th December (Tokyo time). On 21st December 1941,
Thailand concluded a treaty of alliance with Japan.
No witness on behalf of Thailand has complained of
Japan's actions as being acts of aggression. In
these circumstances, we are left without reasonable
certainty that the Japanese advance into Thailand
was contrary to the wishes of the Government of
Thailand and the charges that the defendants initiated
and waged a war of aggression against the Kingdom of
Thailand remain unproved.
<p>
Count 31 charges that a war of aggression was
waged against the British Commonwealth of Nations.
The Imperial Rescript which was issued about 12 noon
on 8th December 1941 (Tokyo time) states "We hereby
declare war in the United States of America and the
British Empire." There is a great deal of lack of
precision in the use of terms throughout the many

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--998--</i></center><hr><a name=page999></a><p>
<blockquote>

plans which were formulated of an attack on
British possessions. Thus, such terms as "Britain",
"Great Britain", and "England" are used without
discrimination and apparently used as meaning the
same thing. In this case, there is no doubt as to
the entity which is designated by "the British
Empire". The correct titel of that entity is
"the British Commonwealth of Nations". That by the
use of the term "the British Empire" they intended
the entity which is more correctly called "the
British Commonwealth of Nations" is clear when we
consider the terms of the Combined Fleet Operations
Order No. 1 already referred to. That order provides
that a state of war will exist after 0000 hours
X-Day, which was 8th December 1941 (Tokyo time), and
that the Japanese forces would then commence operations.
It is provided that in the very first phase of the
operations, the "South Seas Force" will be ready for
the enemy fleet in the Australia area. Later, it was
provided that "The following are areas expected to
be occupied or destroyed as quickly as operational
conditions permit, a, Eastern New Guinea, New Britain".
These were governed by the Commonwealth of Australia
under mandate from the League of Nations. The areas
to be destroyed or occupied are also stated to 
include "Strategic points in teh Australia area".
Moreover, "important points in the Australian coast"
were to be mined. Now the Commonwealth of Australia
is not accurately described as being part of
"Great Britain", which is the term used in teh
Combined Fleet Secret Operations Order No. 1, nor

is it accurately described as being part of "the
British Empire", which is the term used in the
Imperial Rescript. It is properly designated as
part of "the British Commonwealth of Nations".
It is plain therefore that the entity against which
hostilities were to be directed and against which
the declaration of war was directed was "the British
Commonwealth of Nations", and Count 31 is well-founded
when it charges that a war of aggression was
waged against the British Commonwealth of Nations.
<p>
It is charged in Count 30 of the Indictment
that a war of aggression was waged against the
Commonwealth of the Philippines. The Philippines
during the period of the war were not a completely
sovereign state. So far as international relations
were concerned, they were part of the United States
of America. It is beyond doubt that a war of
aggression was waged agasint the people of the
Philippines. For the sake of technical accuracy
we shall consider the aggression against the people
of the Philippines as being a part of the war of
aggression waged against the United States of America.

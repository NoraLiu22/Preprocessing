Tasty Buds</H1></center></u>
For grades 3-12<p> 

The taste buds on the tongue are, of course, important for the flavor of
food.  See if different parts of the tongue are most sensitive to
different characteristics of food (i.e., salty, bitter, sour, sweet).  
Get examples of each of these tastes (for example, salty water, sugary
water, vinegar or lemon for sour and onion juice for bitter).  Give each
person a set of solutions and some toothpicks.  Dip the toothpicks into
the solutions and <b>lightly</b> touch the tongue.  Repeat the tests on
different portions of the tongue. It may help to drink a bit of water in
between tests.  Also be careful in testing the back part of the
tongue...some people may gag!  Are parts of the tongue more
sensitive to specific flavors or are all parts of the tongue equally 
sensitive to the flavors?  If so, indicate on a drawing of the tongue 
the areas that are most sensitive to the different tastes.  Compare 
tongue drawings with tongue drawings from other people.  <P>

The Nose Knows</H1></center></u>

For grades K-6<P> 

The nose is responsible for part of the flavor of food.  To demonstrate
this, blindfold a person and have that person hold their nose.  Give them
something to taste such as an pear or apple slice.  Can they tell the
difference between the pear and the apple?  Try to distinguish the pear
slice from the apple slice.  Other good comparison items are baby foods:  
they come in a variety of fruit and vegetable flavors.  A test
food most kids like is the jelly bean.  Buy several flavors
of jelly beans and have everyone try to guess the flavor (with and without
the use of their nose).  The advantage of using the baby foods and jelly
beans is that they are have the same texture.  Therefore, the blindfolded
person will not be able to use touch information to distinguish the
different items.<P> <img src = "mat2.gif"> Materials: <UL> <LI>Foods to

Taste Match Game</H1></center></u>
For grades K-3<P>
Can you put different foods into sweet, bitter, sour or salty groups?  
Gather up 3-4 different foods that fit into those 4 categories of taste.  
If you can't find any "real" food, you can cut out pictures from 
magazines, but you won't get a chance to taste it.  Taste one of the items 
and record whether it tastes sweet, bitter, sour or salty.  After you have 
tried all the food, compare your results with the rest of the class.  Does 
everyone agree?<P>

No Saliva, No Taste?</H1></center></u>
For grades 3-12<P>

In order for food to have taste, chemicals from the food must first 
dissolve in saliva.  Once dissolved, the chemicals can be detected by 
receptors on taste buds.  Therefore, if there is no saliva, you should not 
be able to taste anything.  To test this theory, dry your tongue with a 
clean paper towel.  Once your tongue is dry, try tasting a few samples 
of salt, sugar or other dry foods.  Rinse your mouth and dry your 
tongue after each test.<P>

<u>Experiment #1</u><BR>
For grades 3-12<P>
Does what you see influence what you taste?  Find out here.  Get four 
different flavored sodas (fruity ones such as lemon, grape, cherry, etc.).  
These sodas should also be different colors.  Also get one unflavored, clear 
soda (such as, club soda or seltzer water).  Add a few drops of food 
coloring to the unflavored, clear soda (orange works well).  This will 
make it LOOK like orange soda, but of course, it will NOT have any taste.  
Pour the five drinks into different cups for taste testers.  Ask people to 
tell you what each drink tastes like.<P>

<img src = "quest1.gif"> How many people said your unflavored drink was 
"Orange"?<P>
Food companies add color to food to influence what it tastes like.  People 
like to see foods in colors that they expect.<P>

<u>Experiment #2</u><br>
For grades 3-12<P>
<img src = "./gif/chocojar.gif" align=right hspace=15
width="100" height="74">
In this experiment, use jelly beans instead of soda.  For each subject you
test, you will need pairs of jelly beans.  For example, get
2 cherry jelly beans, 2 lime jelly beans, 2 lemon jelly beans and 2 orange
jelly beans.  Each jelly bean flavor has its own unique color:  red for
cherry, green for lime, yellow for lemon and orange for orange.  Divide
the jelly beans into two groups:  each group should have one of each
flavor. <P>

Label small containers or napkins with the numbers 1 through 4.  Place the
jelly beans from the first group into a container or on a napkin - one
jelly bean into each container or on each napkin.   Wrap the jelly
beans in the second group in foil or place them in a cup so that your 
subjects cannot see them.  Label these cups with the numbers 1 through
4.  Make sure that the flavors of the second group have different numbers
than the flavors in the first group.<p>

Now you are ready to start the experiment.  If you want, you can tell your
subject the names of the flavors that they will be tested.  In other
words, you can say, "The jelly beans you taste will be either cherry,
orange, lime or lemon." Tell your subject to look at the jelly bean in
container #1 of the first group and then taste the jelly bean.  After they
have tasted the jelly bean, tell your subject to write down its flavor.  
Do the same thing with jelly beans #2-#4.<P>

The next part of the experiment is a bit more difficult.  You must keep
the color of the jelly beans in group 2 hidden from your subjects.  You
can blindfold your subjects or have them close their eyes while they taste
the jelly beans.  Keep track of the flavors that your subjects say each
jelly bean tastes like.  You can even tell your subjects that the flavors
they will taste will be the same as before.<P>

<img src = "quest1.gif"> What are the results?  Did you subjects make any
mistakes when they could not see the color of the jelly bean?  If they
did, what was the most common mistake?  What would happen if you used an
unusual flavor?  What would happen if you found a jelly bean with an
abnormal color...for example a red-colored lemon-flavor jelly bean?<P>

each subject)

<p align="left">
Digital curation is a complex of actors, policies, practices, and technologies that enables meaningful consumer engagement with content of interest across space and time.  At the University of California Curation Center (UC3) we have embarked on a comprehensive reassessment of our curation services and systems to ensure that they are meeting our goals most effectively.  In doing so we found ourselves almost immediately asking seemingly simple, yet deceptively difficult to answer questions, such as what exactly do we mean by digital curation and preservation?  While there exist a number of useful frameworks for specific areas of curation activity, for example, the Open Archival Information System (OAIS), Trusted Repositories Audit and Certification (TRAC), Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), and others, it is not clear how, or indeed whether, these disparate efforts cohere into a unified and encompassing model of the curation domain.  For example, many of the concepts at the heart of these standards, perhaps most problematically, "digital object", remain woefully overloaded and under-formalized.  Consequently, UC3 has developed a new model of the curation domain to provide a self-consistent and comprehensive conceptual foundation for the planning and evaluation of its activities (<a href="http://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/Foundations">http://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/Foundations</a>).
</p>

<p align="left">
The UC3 model draws freely from many prior efforts in the digital library field, but also incorporates a number of relevant concepts from other disciplines.  Most notably, the model considers digital content in terms of five semiotic dimensions of semantics, syntactics, empirics, pragmatics, and dynamics, which refer respectively to content's underlying abstract <i>meaning</i> or <i>affect</i>, symbolic <i>encoding</i> structures, physical <i>representations</i>, realizing <i>behaviors</i>, and <i>persistence</i> and <i>evolution</i> through time.  Correspondingly, there is a hierarchical typology of accumulating content utility comprising <i>entities</i>, <i>artifacts</i>, <i>articles</i>, <i>commodities</i>, <i>assets</i>, and <i>heirlooms</i>, which are respectively existential, intentional, purposeful, meaningful, useful, and reliable digital objects.  An entity, for example, refers to any undifferentiated digital carrier; an artifact is created through a formative act of <i>identification</i> that demarcates and fixes a <i>particular</i> set of bits on a carrier that can then effectively be the focus of curation interest; an article is created through an informative act of <i>characterization</i> that types an otherwise syntactically opaque artifact; a commodity is created through another informative act of characterization that <i>describes</i> an otherwise semantically opaque article, and so on.
</p>

<p align="left">
Content engagement is modeled in terms of <i>productive</i>, <i>managerial</i>, and <i>consumptive</i> roles and loci of concerns that co-exist across a continuum of <i>originating</i>, <i>organizing</i> and <i>pluralizing</i> dimensions that respectively encompass the establishment of, codification and imposition of structure upon, and extension of the reach and consequence of curated content.  Curation policies, strategies, and plans are modeled in terms of six imperatives: <i>predilect</i>, <i>collect</i>, <i>protect</i>, <i>introspect</i>, <i>project</i>, and <i>connect</i>.  Each of these imperatives is applicable to every typological class.  For example, the protect imperative applied across entities, artifacts, articles, commodities, assets, and heirlooms leads to considerations of <i>environmental</i>, <i>administrative</i>, <i>technical</i>, <i>intellectual</i>, <i>access</i>, and <i>change</i> control.
</p>

<p align="left">
The UC3 curation domain model provides a comprehensive, yet parsimonious framework in which to conceive, plan, and evaluate its services and initiatives.  While the terminology and concepts defined by the model may appear somewhat unfamiliar, they can be used to make unambiguous, concise, yet nuanced statements concerning curation intention, policy, and outcomes.  UC3 welcomes comment and discussion of its work (<a href="http://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/Foundations">http://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/Foundations</a>).

<p align="left">
Open Access (OA) to scholarly knowledge has reached a great height in recent years, due to overwhelming supports from the scholarly communities and national funding agencies. However, there is constant need of capacity development of graduating and early-career researchers, who later will be engaged with OA contents as user, reviewer and creator. The research lifecycle has an important phase, i.e., dissemination of research findings, which now embraces OA channels in many countries. Many for-profit publishers are offering avenues of disseminating research papers through hybrid journals, i.e., publishing in both subscription-based and OA contents. Here an author may need to pay a publishing fee/article processing charge (APC) for publishing an OA article in a hybrid journal, while rest of the articles may not be accessible to researchers in non-subscriber institutions. Recently, collectively consensus has arrived with authors to resist transfer of copyright to publishers. Instead they wish to retain copyright and a Licence to Publish (LTP) agreement is given to publishers for publishing research papers. The SPARC Authors' Addendum is one such instrument to establish LTP agreements between authors and publishers, and for retaining copyright by the authors. Authors who retain copyright with themselves have much more flexible ways to disseminate their published works through their institutional repositories, subject repositories and academic social networks. On the other hand, Creative Commons (CC) licenses are commonly used in disseminating OA contents both in online and offline modes. 
</p>

<p align="left">
All these aspects are very new to graduating young scholars, particularly those who are based in developing countries or the Global South. They need to be made aware and sensitized of these developments in scholarly communications spheres and processes. With the arrival of OA journals and knowledge repositories, researchers have far more choices of disseminating their research findings and also getting immediate global attention or recognition. OA research, similar to other published research, can be measured through citation counts, article-level metrics or altmetrics. Young researchers also need to know about predatory OA journals and publishers, which try to enter into the OA ecosystem compromising quality of research.
</p>

<p align="left">
With this situation, UNESCO in association with the Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia (CEMCA) of the Commonwealth of Learning (COL), launched a set of open access curricula and self-directional learning (SDL) modules for researchers, librarians and library schools<sup><a href="#das3">3</a></sup>. The OA curricula is produced for two distinct target groups, namely, (I) Open Access for Researchers, and  (II) Open Access for Library Schools. The researchers' curricula is an elaborative exploration of scholarly communication processes, concepts of openness and open access, intellectual property rights and research evaluation metrics, while the library schools' curricula has more insights on how library and information professionals would deal with advocating OA scholarly communications and managing OA resources in their institutions. The researchers' curricula consist of five modules whereas library schools' curricula consist of four modules. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The initial structure of OA Curricula was prepared jointly by the project director and UNESCO experts. An international multi-stakeholder experts' meeting on development of curriculum and self-directed learning tools for OA was held on 4-6 September 2013 at New Delhi, where 23 experts participated to finalize the curriculum<sup><a href="#das1">1</a></sup>. Two supplementary online consultations were also held to substantiate the expert meeting, which helped UNESCO to outline the content for each of the curriculum and provided a framework to develop modules. The OA Curricula was prepared as an outcome of the project titled <i>Development of Curriculum and Self-Directed Learning Tools for Open Access</i>, led by Dr. Sanjaya Mishra of COL as project director. Another research outcome of this project was a report titled <i>Situation Analysis and Capacity Building Needs for Open Access</i>, which influenced the preliminary structure of OA curricula<sup><a href="#das2">2</a></sup>.</p> 

<p align="left">
Presently available in print format, UNESCO is planning to make these OA Curricula and SDL Modules available online with a CC license downloadable from the UNESCO website<sup><a href="#das3">3</a></sup>.

DigitalLearn.org provides training for those looking to gain new digital literacy skills as well as resources and a community of practice for staff and volunteers in libraries, community organizations, non-profits, schools, and other digital literacy training sites. The Public Library Association (PLA) created the program in partnership with the American Library Association (ALA) Office of Information Technology and Policy and the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies (COSLA) with supplemental funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services and guidance from a diverse community of stakeholders and digital literacy advocates. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The "Learn" portion of DigitalLearn.org provides free interactive and self-directed elearning classes that cover a wide range of digital skills, including both basic and practical skills.  It was launched In May 2013 and it remains the most widely used resource within the program. New classes, including a growing selection in Spanish, are added to the site regularly. A PDF certificate is provided to participants upon completion. To date, over 17,000 people have completed an online course on the DigitalLearn.org site and its courses are regularly offered as library resources, included in non-profit curriculums, and even are included in parent education days at schools. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The "Teach" portion of the site contains a community of practice for trainers, volunteers, and others working to increase digital literacy and digital engagement to connect and collaborate. This portion was launched in June of 2013 and currently has just over 330 unique posts from more than 10,000 members. Many of the members share curriculum and class materials for others to use. Additionally, there are regular posts about upcoming events, including webinars, news items relevant to the field, questions from those seeking guidance, and people sharing insights from their work and experiences. The DigitalLearn.org  trainer community of practice (CoP) is the most active CoP PLA has ever launched. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Although the grant funding for DigitalLearn.org expired in August 2014, PLA has committed to the program  and will continue to foster the growth and engagement that make it a vital asset to the digital literacy community. PLA is actively working to acquire additional funding, to build new partnerships, to expand elearning content and to improve the user experience and structure of the site. 
</p>

In February, the <a href="http://openpreservation.org/" target="das1">Open Preservation Foundation</a> (OPF) announced it was taking up stewardship of <a href="http://jhove.sourceforge.net/" target="das1">JHOVE</a> (JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment) alongside <a href="https://github.com/opf-labs/jhove2" target="das1">JHOVE2</a> (its successor).
</p>

<p align="left">
JHOVE is an extensible software framework that performs format
identification, validation, and characterisation of digital objects. It is
a widely used tool in the digital preservation community. The recent OPF
member survey showed it is the most commonly used software amongst its
members. In the results of the OPF broader digital preservation community
survey, which will be published shortly, participating organisations also rated JHOVE as one of the top most important tools amongst dozens.
</p>

<p align="left">
The OPF will take up curation of JHOVE in accordance with its <a href="http://openpreservation.org/technology/principles/software-maturity/" target="das1">software
maturity model</a>. The model comprises five key strategies: quality, visibility, training, open licensing and community integration. In line with each strategy it defines the characteristics of a mature software product and the levels of support that should be provided. The model aims to ensure that software is sustainable by the digital preservation community through use and
maintenance with support from the OPF.
</p>

<p align="left">
During March the OPF will be working with Portico and other <a href="http://openpreservation.org/about/members/" target="das1">members</a> to complete the transfer of JHOVE to its new home. The latest code base will move to the OPF <a href="https://github.com/openpreserve" target="das1">GitHub organisation page</a>. All documentation, source code files, and full change history will be publicly available, alongside other OPF supported software <a href="http://openpreservation.org/technology/projects/" target="das1">projects</a>, including JHOVE2, Fido, jpylyzer, and the SCAPE project tools.
</p>

<p align="left">
Once the initial transfer is complete the next step will be to set up a
continuous integration (CI) build on <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="das1">Travis</a>, an online CI service that's integrated with GitHub. This will ensure that all new code submissions are built and tested publicly and automatically, including all external pull requests. This will establish a firm foundation for future changes based on agile software development best practises.
</p>

<p align="left">
With this foundation in place OPF will test and incorporate JHOVE fixes
from the community into the new project. Several OPF members have already
developed fixes based on their own automated processes, which they will be
releasing to the community. Working as a group these fixes will be examined
and tested methodically. At the same time the OPF's priority will be to
produce a <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages" target="das1">Debian package</a> that can be downloaded and installed from its apt repository.
</p>

<p align="left">
Following the transfer OPF will gather requirements from its members and
the wider digital preservation community. The OPF aims to establish and
oversee a self-sustaining community around JHOVE that will take these
requirements forward, carrying out roadmapping exercises for future
development and maintenance. The OPF will also assess the need for specific
training and support material for JHOVE such as documentation and online or
virtual machine demonstrators.
</p>

<p align="left">
The transfer of JHOVE is supported by its creators and developers: <a href="http://library.harvard.edu/" target="das1">Harvard
Library</a>, <a href="http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/" target="das1">Portico</a>, the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/" target="das1">California Digital
Library</a>, and <a href="http://www.garymcgath.com/" target="das1">Gary McGath</a>. The original project was part-funded by the <a href="http://mellon.org/" target="das1">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> in 2003.

</p>

<p align="left">
Nearly 20 years after introducing the Documenting the American South digital collection (<a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/">http://docsouth.unc.edu/</a>), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library has released DocSouth Data (<a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/">http://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/</a>). DocSouth Data makes it easy to download items from the collection in plain text for use with common text mining tools. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The popularity of digital humanities has led to increased interest among humanists in text mining and data analysis. While many tools are available for anyone who wants to experiment with these techniques, researchers often hit a roadblock when it comes to finding collections that are ready for analysis. 
</p>

<p align="left">
DocSouth Data began as an idea to address this challenge by providing access to the data behind the North American Slave Narratives (<a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/">http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/</a>) collection; the most widely used collection in Documenting the American South. 
</p>

<p align="left">
This was an obvious choice for several reasons; First, it is an extremely compelling collection of historical significance. Second, it is complete and coherent in that it includes all known autobiographical narratives of fugitive and former slaves published as broadsides, pamphlets, or books in English up to 1920. Third, these files were transcribed by hand, making the data far more accurate and reliable than many OCR texts.
</p>
 
<p align="left">
DocSouth Data also provides texts from three additional collections of similar quality: The Church in the Southern Black Community (<a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/">http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/</a>), First-Person Narratives of the American South (<a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/">http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/</a>), and the Library of Southern Literature (<a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/">http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/</a>). 
</p>

<p align="left">
Users can download the collections in two ways: By using a link on the homepage of each collection for which there is a DocSouth Data download, or by navigating directly to the DocSouth Data page at <a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/" target="das1">http://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/</a> and using the links there.
</p>

<p align="left">
DocSouth Data was designed specifically with a tool called Voyant (<a href="http://voyant-tools.org/">http://voyant-tools.org/</a>) in mind. Created by literature scholars, Voyant easily allows users to create visualizations based on word frequencies and locations within a text. Many other common text analysis tools can also be used to explore the collections. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The UNC Library is particularly excited about this project, as it represents a highly collaborative effort to make some of our richest and most distinctive collections accessible to cutting edge research methods.

<p>March 11, 2015 &#151; &quot;The National Information Standards
Organization has been awarded a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
to develop a Consensus Framework to Support Patron Privacy in Digital
Library and Information Systems. The grant will support a series of
community discussions on how libraries, publishers, and information systems
providers can build better privacy protection into their operations. The
grant will also support creation of a draft framework to support patron
privacy and subsequent publicity of the draft prior to its advancement for
approval as a NISO Recommended Practice....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...This project will consist of three phases. The first will be
a pre-meeting
discussion phase, which will consist of four virtual forums to discuss
privacy of internal library systems, privacy of publisher systems, privacy
of provider systems, and legal aspects influencing data sharing and
policies. Each of the discussion sessions will be a three-hour web-based
session designed to lay the groundwork for a productive in-person meeting at
the conclusion of the American Library Association meeting in San Francisco,
CA in June 2015. Following the in-person meeting, a Framework document will
be completed detailing the privacy principles and recommendations agreed to
by the participants, and then circulated for public comment and
finalization.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Double-blind peer review for <i>Nature</i> journals</p>


<p>February 18, 2015 &#151; &quot;Authors will be able to opt for double-blind peer review across <i>Nature</i> and the <i>Nature Research Journals</i>.  <i>Nature Communications</i>, Nature Publishing Group's flagship open access journal, will be joining the trial later in 2015. ... Double-blind peer review is being introduced in response to author feedback, and follows trials by <i>Nature Geoscience</i> and <i>Nature Climate Change</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In double-blind peer review both the authors and the reviewers are anonymised. The <i>Nature</i>-branded journals will also continue to offer single-blind peer review, in which the reviewers are anonymous but know the authors' identity. Corresponding authors will be able to choose whether single-blind or double-blind peer review is used on their submission.  Advocates of double-blind peer review argue that it removes biases that relate to the authors (for example those based on gender, seniority or organisation) that might otherwise impact the objectivity with which the review is carried out.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">UKSG Transfer Code of Practice to be Maintained by NISO</p>


<p>February 9, 2015 &#151; &quot;The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and UKSG announce that the <i>Transfer Code of Practice</i> will now be supported and maintained by NISO. The Code provides voluntary guidelines for publishers to follow when transferring journal titles between parties to ensure that the journal content remains easily accessible by librarians and readers. NISO has republished Transfer version 3.0 as a NISO Recommended Practice (NISO RP-24-2015) and will move all supporting documentation to the NISO website. A NISO Standing Committee has been established to manage the ongoing support of the <i>Transfer Code of Practice</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'The Transfer project was initiated by UKSG in 2006 and the first version of the Code was released in 2007 in response to issues identified by the scholarly communications community when journal titles change platform providers or owners,' explains Elizabeth Winter, Electronic Resources Coordinator, Georgia Institute of Technology Libraries, and Co-chair of the NISO Transfer Standing Committee. 'Such transfers can negatively impact libraries, intermediaries (such as serials subscription agents, link resolver administrators, and vendors of large-scale discovery systems), and readers. Often the journal would seem to disappear and links from existing information systems to the content would break, even though the title was still being published. Publishers and platform providers have a vested interest in ensuing that their content is easily accessible. The Transfer Code provides them with the specifics of how they can make sure that all of their stakeholders can continue to make the content available with the least amount of disruption.'...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The Transfer Code of Practice is available on the NISO website from the Transfer Standing Committee's webpage: <a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/transfer/">http://www.niso.org/workrooms/transfer/</a>. The ETAS alerting service continues to be available at: <a href="http://etas.jusp.mimas.ac.uk/">http://etas.jusp.mimas.ac.uk/</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>February 2, 2015 &#151; &quot;Today the President released his FY 2016 Budget Request to the U.S. Congress. The budget includes $237,427,957 for the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). With these funds, IMLS will provide leadership for the nation's 123,000 libraries and 35,000 museums in all fifty states and U.S. territories through grant making, policy development, and research. The Congressional Justification, which contains detailed information on the Budget Request, is now available at <a href="http://www.imls.gov/assets/1/AssetManager/FY16_CJ.pdf">http://www.imls.gov/assets/1/AssetManager/FY16_CJ.pdf</a> on the IMLS website, as well as the IMLS Budget table: <a href="http://www.imls.gov/assets/1/AssetManager/BudgetHistory_13-16.pdf">http://www.imls.gov/assets/1/AssetManager/BudgetHistory_13-16.pdf</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The President requests a $9.6 million increase over the FY 2015 enacted level, of which $8.8 million supports a national digital platform, which will be funded through the IMLS National Leadership Grant programs for Libraries ($5.3 million) and Museums ($3.5 million). The agency will focus the additional resources on promoting development of new standards for continuing education for library and museum professionals....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...IMLS grant programs support library services in every state and territory through a population-based formula grant. The agency also administers competitive grant programs for libraries and museums that engage hundreds of library, museum, education, and technology professionals in a rigorous peer review process to identify well-designed projects. IMLS supports projects that strengthen library and museum services for Native Americans and Native Hawaiians, as well as projects that strengthen African American museums.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">IMLS to Award $154.8 Million to States to Improve Library Services</p>


<p>January 21, 2015 &#151; &quot;The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) today released its <a href="http://www.idevmail.net/link.aspx?l=9&amp;d=73&amp;mid=333844&amp;m=2489">Fiscal Year 2015 allotment table</a> for 56 State Library Administrative Agencies (SLAAs), totaling $154,848,000. These annual grants represent the largest source of federal funding support for library services in the U.S.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The grants allocate a base amount to each of the SLAAs, plus a supplemental amount based on population. The agency's <a href="http://www.idevmail.net/link.aspx?l=2&d=73&mid=333844&m=2489">Grants to States</a> program provides federal funds as a supplement to existing state library services rather than a replacement for state funding, and it assures local involvement through financial matching requirements. The newly released allotment table identifies both the federal (66%) and state match share (34%) for each SLAA.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">NISO Identifies Emerging Trends and Strategic Directions for Future Standards Work</p>


<p>January 12, 2015 &#151; &quot;The Architecture Committee of the
National Information Standards Organization (NISO) has issued a NISO
Strategic Directions document that identifies the trends and emerging themes
that will direct the future development portfolios of standards and
recommended practices. In 2007, NISO created a new governance structure and,
as part of this restructuring, implemented the NISO Framework, an
overarching model and roadmap for NISO's standards work. Seven years later,
NISO continues to structure the standards portfolio around the core areas of
Content and Collection Management, Business Information, and Discovery and
Delivery-with a Topic Committee providing leadership for each area. The
Architecture Committee determines overall strategic vision for NISO's work,
oversees the work of the Topic Committees, and addresses any overlapping
areas. The 2015 Strategic Directions document reflects a review by the Topic
Committees of their current and recent portfolios, and a discussion of
potential future activities where NISO should be involved in the development
of new standards and recommended practices.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'The Architecture Committee launched the strategic directions initiative
with a community survey to gather opinions on the key challenges facing our
constituents over the next three years,' explains Michael Teets, OCLC Vice
President Strategy, Governance and Architecture, and Vice Chair of the NISO
Board of Directors and Chair of the NISO Architecture Committee. 'This input
was used by the Topic Committees along with their own knowledge and research
to determine where NISO can make the most impact in the community through
the development of new standards or recommended practices.'&quot;</p>

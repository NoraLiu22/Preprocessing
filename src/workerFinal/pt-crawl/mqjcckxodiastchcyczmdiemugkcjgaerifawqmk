                     <h2>ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC</h2>

                     <p>The rock music that developed in the Great
Plains is derived from many sources, notably,
the blues, country, and various ethnic folk
styles. Many of the artists who were born and
raised in the Great Plains have exerted a great
influence on the direction that rock music has
taken since the late 1950s. Many others have
had a more local influence, for every Plains
town of any size has its own pulsating rock
scene.</p>

                     <p>The earliest and most influential of the
Great Plains musicians are from Texas. Lubbock's
Buddy Holly (1936-59), with his band,
the Crickets, had several major hits in the late
1950s, beginning with "That'll Be the Day"
(1957). Though strongly influenced by rock
styles from Memphis and Chicago, the Crickets
developed their own rock sound, which
incorporated a West Texas feel, that affected
the next generation of rockers, including the
Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Grateful
Dead. Other Texas artists associated with
Holly include the Big Bopper, J. P. Richardson
(1931-59) from Sabine Pass, who was killed in
the same plane crash as Holly, and Waylon
Jennings (1937-2002) of Littlefield, the bassist
for the Crickets who relinquished his airplane
seat to Richardson. Jennings emerged in the
1970s as an important figure in outlaw music
(country music with a strong rock foundation),
in which he was joined by fellow Texan
Willie Nelson, who was born in Abbot in 1933.
Jennings and Nelson are crossover artists,
equally popular with rock and country fans.
Also fatefully associated with Holly is Bobby
Vee, who was born in Fargo, North Dakota, in
1943. Vee's band was brought in as a replacement
act for the February 3, 1959, concert in
Moorhead, Minnesota, that Holly had been
scheduled to play. Vee later had several Top 10
hits in the 1960s, including "Take Good Care
of My Baby" (1961) and "The Night Has a
Thousand Eyes" (1962).</p>

                     <p>Roy Orbison (1936-1988), from Vernon and
Wink, began his career in Texas but eventually
moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he recorded
several songs at Sun Studio, the birthplace
of rockabilly. Orbison had two number
one hit singles, "Running Scared" (1961) and
"Oh, Pretty Woman" (1964). Despite several
personal tragedies in the late 1960s, Orbison
continued to perform in the 1970s and 1980s.
In 1988 he joined George Harrison, Bob Dylan,
Jeff Lynne, and Tom Petty for a triumphant
return to the spotlight in The Traveling Wilburys,
but he died of a heart attack shortly after
the release of their first album.</p>

                     <p>Texas remains the most fertile ground for
rock music on the Plains. Lubbock produced
Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock,
Amarillo Joe Ely, and Fort Worth Townes Van
Zandt. Gilmore, Hancock, and Ely played together
in the acoustic band the Flatlanders in
the early 1970s, a suitable name for musicians
from the Staked Plains of Texas.</p>

                     <p>Several artists from Oklahoma significantly
contributed to the development of rock as
songwriters and performers. Among these are
Hoyt Axton, who was born in 1938 in Duncan.
Among his many songs are "The Pusher" (recorded
by Steppenwolf in 1964) and "Joy to
the World" (a hit for Three Dog Night in
1971). Jimmy Webb, born in Elk City in 1946
(and a millionaire by age twenty-one) is another
prolific Oklahoma songwriter whose
hits include "By the Time I Get to Phoenix"
(Glen Campbell, 1967), "Up, Up, and Away"
(the Fifth Dimension, 1967), and "MacArthur
Park" (Richard Harris, 1968). J. J. Cale (born
in Oklahoma City in 1938) was yet another
talented Oklahoma musician, composing "After
Midnight" (1970) and "Cocaine" (1977) for
Eric Clapton and "Call Me the Breeze" for
Lynyrd Skynyrd (1974) among many others.
Cale became a popular recording artist in the
1970s, offering his own slower, emotional renditions
of these songs.</p>

                     <p>Leon Russell (born in 1941), from Lawton,
became a session instrumentalist in Los Angeles
in 1958, playing guitar, bass, keyboards,
and trumpet. By the 1960s he had established
himself as an important writer and producer,
working with artists like Glen Campbell, the
Byrds, and Gary Lewis and the Playboys. In
1970 Russell was the charismatic musical director
for Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen
tour, and he later helped organize
the band for George Harrison's benefit concert
for Bangladesh. Russell composed many
memorable songs that were featured on his
own down-home albums and recorded by
others; for example, "Delta Lady" was a hit for
Joe Cocker in 1969, and "Superstar" was a major
success for the Carpenters in 1971. Russell
is a consummate session man who has recorded
with artists as different as Frank Sinatra,
Herb Albert, and Bob Dylan.</p>

                     <p>Judy Collins, born in Seattle in 1939 but
raised in Denver, and John Denver (1943-97),
born in Roswell, New Mexico, came out of the
western Plains. Collins, who developed her art
in Denver's coffeehouses, had hits with pop
ballads like "Both Sides Now" (1967) and
"Send in the Clowns" (1975). Denver's music is
more folk-oriented country rock, praising the
virtues of country living, particularly in the
Rocky Mountains. Denver's most memorable
hits include "Rocky Mountain High" (1972)
and "Annie's Song" (1975). After enjoying a
great deal of success in the 1970s, Denver's career
stalled in the 1980s. He was beginning a
comeback in the late 1990s when he was killed
in an airplane accident.</p>

                     <p>Several musicians who were born or raised
in the Prairie Provinces have also been influential
in the development of rock. Joni Mitchell
was born in 1943 in Fort Macleod, Alberta,
and studied art in Calgary. She worked the
folk scene in Toronto and had her first hit with
"Big Yellow Taxi" (1970). A durable and talented
artist, Mitchell has incorporated jazz elements
in her music, particularly, her album
Mingus (1979). Neil Young, one of the major
figures in American rock music, spent his formative
years in Winnipeg before moving back
to Toronto (his birthplace, in 1945) and then
on to Los Angeles. Influenced by 1950s rock
and roll styles, Young came into prominence
in the late 1960s as the lead guitarist for Buffalo
Springfield. After the demise of the band,
Young recorded two albums before joining the
supergroup Crosby, Stills and Nash. They recorded
the album <em>D&#233;j&#224; vu</em> in 1970, but personality
conflicts led to Young leaving the group.
He recorded several albums in the 1970s, notably,
the critically acclaimed Harvest (1971),
and has continued to record prolifically. Because
of his minimalist approach to guitar
soloing, Young is also considered to be the
"godfather" of alternative rock, as his eulogy
to Kurt Cobain (Sleeps with Angels, 1994) and
his collaborations with Pearl Jam (Mirror Ball,
1995) prove.</p>

                     <p>All members of the Guess Who also came out
of Winnipeg. Their numerous hits include
"These Eyes" (1969) and "American Woman"
(1970). At the height of their popularity, lead
guitarist Randy Bachman left the band for personal
reasons, and the group disbanded in 1975.
Bachman joined his brothers Robbie and Tim
and friend Fred Turner to create Bachman-
Turner Overdrive. BTO had several hit songs in
the 1970s, including "You Ain't Seen Nothing
Yet" and "Taking Care of Business" (both 1974),
before disbanding in 1977.</p>

                     <p>Many more Great Plains musicians have
contributed to the development of rock music.
With few exceptions, these artists are
rooted in varying combinations of folk, country,
and blues styles. Again, with few exceptions,
they were obliged to leave the region,
generally for the coasts, to make their names
in the business. But Plains Texans often went
only as far as Austin, and others like Neil
Young and Joni Mitchell still refer to the
Plains as home.</p>

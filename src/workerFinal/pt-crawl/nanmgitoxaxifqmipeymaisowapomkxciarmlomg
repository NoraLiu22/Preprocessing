Rap music (also referred to as rap or hip-hop music) evolved in conjunction with the cultural movement called hip-hop. Rap emerged as a minimalist street sound against the backdrop of the heavily orchestrated and formulaic music coming from the local house parties to dance clubs in the early 1970s. Its earliest performers comprise MCs (derived from master of ceremonies but referring to the actual rapper) and DJs (who use and often manipulate pre-recorded tracks as a backdrop to the rap), break dancers and graffiti writers.</p></section><section class="lazyrender flex flex-col items-center false false false flex flex-col items-center"><div class="w-px h-[64px] sm:h-[100px]" style="background:currentColor"></div><h2 class="font-ui font-bold p-3 w-full max-w-lg border leading-5 text-sm text-center ">Context and History</h2><div class="w-px h-[64px] sm:h-[100px]" style="background:currentColor"></div></section><section class="false false mb-6 max-w-4xl w-full lazyrender mx-auto font-body text-lg md:text-xl richtext" dividers="[object Object]"><p name="p"><strong><em>Old School Roots: early 1970s to the mid-1980s</em></strong></p><p name="p">From its humble beginnings in the Bronx, NY, rap music has moved into the mainstream, redefining the soundscape and character of American popular culture and contributing to the growth of a billion-dollar entertainment industry. Hip-hop music culture is a product of African American, Afro-Caribbean and Latino inner-city communities plagued by poverty, the proliferation of drugs, and gang violence in the 1960s and early 1970s. Some MCs and DJs were members or former members of gangs who used DJing, dancing, and MCing as an alternative to gang warfare. DJ Kool Herc gave the community its blueprints and its first brand of hip-hop music, called b-beat. Hip-hop DJs and MCs originally performed in local house parties and community centers, city parks, neighborhood block parties, and, eventually, local clubs. By the mid-1970s, performance venues included local clubs whose proprietors recognized the commercial potential of this artistic expression. Record and film producers then noticed and began to capitalize on hip-hop culture. Sylvia Robinson of Sugarhill Records introduced rapping into the mainstream with the release of <span class="inline overflow-visible cursor-pointer text-red "><svg fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="inline p-px w-[1em] h-[1em] mr-[0.2em] fill-[red]" style="transform:translateY(-15%)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12s12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0 0 5.373 0 12zm10 6 6.545-6L10 6v12z" fill="#CF1126"></path></svg><span>“Rapper’s Delight”</span></span> (1979) by the Sugarhill Gang. In the 1980s several commercial hip-hop films such as<em> Wild Style</em> (1982), <em>Style Wars</em> (1983), Beat Street (1984), <em>Krush Groove</em> (1985) and <em>Disorderlies</em> (1987) flooded the market with the sound of rap. Major record companies formed partnerships with independent labels and producers specializing in rap music. MCing evolved into the rap music industry while DJing went underground and re-established itself as turntablism (the art of manipulating music with LP records and mixers to create unique rhythms and sounds). Changes to the musical production of hip-hop, along with growing stylistic diversity and advances in technology, led to the community-imposed concept of an old and new school. The “Old School” is associated with the period from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s. Initially, DJs were the featured attraction, juggling beats amplified through large sound speakers and shouting praises and catch-phrases to incite crowd participation. Pioneering DJs include Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa, Grand Wizard Theodore, Grandmaster Flash, and Grandmixer D.ST. When their musical collages and turntable manipulations became so complex that they required their full attention, DJs included a crew of MCs to engage and interact with the crowd of dancers. Grandmaster Flash transferred his street or live mixing style to the studio on “Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel” (1981). A year later, Afrika Bambaataa (<span class="inline overflow-visible cursor-pointer text-red "><svg fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="inline p-px w-[1em] h-[1em] mr-[0.2em] fill-[red]" style="transform:translateY(-15%)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12s12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0 0 5.373 0 12zm10 6 6.545-6L10 6v12z" fill="#CF1126"></path></svg><span>“Planet Rock,”</span></span> 1982) advanced the studio DJing tradition through the use of synthesizers, the 808 drum machine, computers, and analog and digital recording machines and other advanced technologies influenced by Kraftwerk’s “Trans-Europe Express” (1977), and “Numbers” (1981) coupled with funk aesthetics such as Captain Sky’s “Supersperm” (1978) and the rock-style of Babe Ruth Band’s “The Mexican” (1972).</p><p name="p"><br/></p></section><section class="false mt-6 mb-6 !grid subgrid" dividers="[object Object]"><div class="jsx-e9704e6577f6ea52 grid pageGrid !col-span-full relative grid-cols-[var(--grid-page)] auto-rows-min bg-black py-7 "><div class="jsx-cebddd4a6312a665 mediadetails font-ui text-center md:text-left text-sm mx-auto md:mx-0 sticky z-50 max-w-xs text-grey-100 top-6">&quot;It&#x27;s Nasty&quot; - Grandmaster Flash &amp; The Furious Five</div><div class="sticky top-24 invisible" caption="&quot;It&#x27;s Nasty&quot; - Grandmaster Flash &amp;amp; The Furious Five" style="z-index:0"><div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center" style="height:calc(100vh - 12rem)"><div class="w-full"><div class="max-w-[80%] mx-auto" style="aspect-ratio:16/9;height:100%;background-image:url(https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video125/v4/0f/b3/e3/0fb3e39a-eb81-b855-71a2-90e90d1e3c15/USRH12101977.sca1.jpg/1600x900mv.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center"><div style="width:100%;height:100%"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="invisible"></div></div></section><section class="false mt-6 mb-6 max-w-4xl w-full lazyrender mx-auto font-body text-lg md:text-xl richtext" dividers="[object Object]"><p name="p"><strong><em>The Golden Era: Commercialization and the New School Artists (mid-1980s to the mid-1990s)</em></strong></p><p name="p">“New School” rap was coined by the 2nd generation artist (1984) to distinguish the pop sensibilities of the first commercial generation of rap artists and ranged from the pop-oriented humorous style of the Fat Boys (“Jail House Rap,” 1984) and D.J.

The chaotic sounds of Public Enemy (<em>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</em>, 1988) and N.W.A (<em>Straight Outta Compton</em>, 1988) became known as hardcore; the harsh lyrical content mirrored the deteriorating conditions of the inner-cities as evidenced by abandoned factories, boarded buildings, dilapidated houses, drug addicts, the homeless, and ongoing confrontations with the police. The hardcore sounds and lyrics of Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, and KRS-One became known as “conscious” rap (also known as “message” and “Afrocentric” rap); those of N.W.A, Ice-T, Ice-Cube, and Eazy-E were called “gangsta” rap. Both styles dominated the hip-hop soundscape through much of the 1990s, but gangsta took over in the 21st century, influencing the styles of Master P, 50 Cent, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Despite this domination, an array of hip-hop styles coexisted, including hybrid productions that fused elements of R&amp;B and/or funk with the beats of hip-hop such as those by MC Hammer, Heavy D and the Boyz, Sean “Puffy” Combs, and Kid ‘n Play. Afrocentric and conscious rappers like Lauryn Hill, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and Gang Starr favored soul and jazz samples in their mixes.</p></section><section class="false mt-6 mb-6 !grid subgrid" dividers="[object Object]"><div class="jsx-e9704e6577f6ea52 grid pageGrid !col-span-full relative grid-cols-[var(--grid-page)] auto-rows-min bg-black py-7 "><div class="jsx-cebddd4a6312a665 mediadetails font-ui text-center md:text-left text-sm mx-auto md:mx-0 sticky z-50 max-w-xs text-grey-100 top-6">&quot;Ladies First&quot; (feat.

Kanye West’s production and lyricism redirected attention away from gangsta rap and explored a range of topics including his middle-class upbringing, anti-Black racism, corporatism, and his faith presented in full self-aggrandizing style. Additionally, Eminem will become a most revered lyricist, by rap artists and rap fans alike, breaking past an obstacle of white inauthenticity laid down by Vanilla Ice a decade earlier. Musically, music-making turned away from the East Coast and the West coast and found a new home in the South. Several epicenters develop influential styles: Miami (Miami bass), New Orleans (bounce), Houston (screwed), and Atlanta (crunk and trap). By the 2010s, socially conscious rap will crossover into the mainstream as R&amp;B and rap artists respond to tension borne from increased police and vigilante shootings of unarmed Black men, women, and children, and from advances in technology for self-production and instant sharing through social media. Key artists include Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Joey Bada$$. Equally important in the 2010s is the rise of female MCs as producers of critically acclaimed albums, proving once again that rap consumers will purchase their music. Women leading the trend include Nicky Minaj and Cardi B.<br class="softbreak"/></p></section><section class="lazyrender flex flex-col items-center false false false flex flex-col items-center"><div class="w-px h-[64px] sm:h-[100px]" style="background:currentColor"></div><h2 class="font-ui font-bold p-3 w-full max-w-lg border leading-5 text-sm text-center ">Musical Features/Performance Style</h2><div class="w-px h-[64px] sm:h-[100px]" style="background:currentColor"></div></section><section class="false false false max-w-4xl w-full lazyrender mx-auto font-body text-lg md:text-xl richtext" dividers="[object Object]"><p name="p">Old school rap is associated with a party-oriented musical and lyrical style as heard in Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five’s <span class="inline overflow-visible cursor-pointer text-red "><svg fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="inline p-px w-[1em] h-[1em] mr-[0.2em] fill-[red]" style="transform:translateY(-15%)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12s12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0 0 5.373 0 12zm10 6 6.545-6L10 6v12z" fill="#CF1126"></path></svg><span>“Birthday Party”</span></span> (1981). Performers of the old school (early 1970s–mid-1980s) gained their reputations from live performances. Their recordings are characterized by the use of live bands and/or Latin-influenced percussion; the incorporation of scratching and other turntable effects; call-and-response chants between MCs and crowds; and lyrics delivered in rhymed couplets (A-A-B-B).</p><p name="p">New school artists such as Eric B. and Rakim (“Eric B. is President,” 1987) added a virtuoso twist to the A-A-B-B scheme by employing internal rhymes that pair words in the middle of a line rather than simply at the end. The “new school” substituted the aggressive sounds of the street for the party sounds of the old school. This hard-edged aesthetic emphasized dissonance and a heavy backbeat, incorporating real sounds of inner-city life such as gunshots, sirens, street cries, and the occasional political speech. In the 1980s and ’90s, electronic and digital productions of hip-hop increasingly replaced live performances. Synthesizers, drum machines, and computers became the primary instruments and eventually sampled materials from various sources, especially funk, provided the foundation for new songs.</p><p name="p">In the late 1990s some new school artists like the Roots and Guru began reincorporating live instruments into their recordings and during live performances, such as <span class="inline overflow-visible cursor-pointer text-red "><svg fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="inline p-px w-[1em] h-[1em] mr-[0.2em] fill-[red]" style="transform:translateY(-15%)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12s12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0 0 5.373 0 12zm10 6 6.545-6L10 6v12z" fill="#CF1126"></path></svg><span>“Loungin’,”</span></span> Guru’s collaboration with jazz great Donald Byrd on trumpet and piano.

In the second millennium, the southern rap styles explode. Although there is no one southern style, they do share in common some characteristics: rhythmically and melodically minimalistic with coarse accents on the high and low ends leaving a lot of space for vocals.</p><p name="p">Early foundations for southern rap emerge come from Miami bass in the mid-1980s made famous by X-rated rappers 2 Live Crew. The sound is grounded on a deep, bass-driven groove that speaks to this cosmopolitan area dance music scene, including Latin rhythms and African-Caribbean song styles like soca, cumbia, rumba, and plena. Southern rap diversified in the 1990s, reflecting local tradition but crossing over to national and international popularity in the 21st century.</p><p name="p">Bounce from New Orleans incorporates parade-strutting beats that guide the energetic feel of the music and rappers’ cadences to get dancers to shake their backsides or “twerk.” Examples include David Banner’s <span class="inline overflow-visible cursor-pointer text-red "><svg fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="inline p-px w-[1em] h-[1em] mr-[0.2em] fill-[red]" style="transform:translateY(-15%)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12s12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0 0 5.373 0 12zm10 6 6.545-6L10 6v12z" fill="#CF1126"></path></svg><span>“Like a Pimp”</span></span> (2003), which also includes a signature “Triggerman” sample found in many bounce songs, and Big Freedia “Boot Whop” (2012). In Houston, DJ Screw invented the screw style but unlike other southern rap genres, he slows down the tempo so much that its hypnotic pace matches the dulling effect of the local party drink, sweetened codeine syrup. A song like UGK’s “Short Texas” after DJ Screw re-engineers the song draws out every syllable of UGK’s verses, slurred and deep, and sonically drowsy. By 2000, screwed music (also known as chopped and screwed) would be made more palatable for a national market with an early hit <span class="inline overflow-visible cursor-pointer text-red "><svg fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="inline p-px w-[1em] h-[1em] mr-[0.2em] fill-[red]" style="transform:translateY(-15%)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12s12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0 0 5.373 0 12zm10 6 6.545-6L10 6v12z" fill="#CF1126"></path></svg><span>“Sippin’ on Some Syrup”</span></span> (2000) by Three 6 Mafia and UGK and A$AP Rocky’s “Houston Old Head” (2011), a superstar of the style coming from New York. Both examples maintain the essential elements such as a tempo and groove that is recognizably the style DJ Screw gave Houston fans but with a less narcotic feel.</p><p name="p">Atlanta and Memphis will create a new, high-energy club music crunk demarcated by grittier sounds, hoarse chants, antiphonic, repetitive refrains, and the barest-bones beats. Lil Jon’s “Get Crunk” (1997) and Ying Yang Twin’s <span class="inline overflow-visible cursor-pointer text-red "><svg fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="inline p-px w-[1em] h-[1em] mr-[0.2em] fill-[red]" style="transform:translateY(-15%)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12s12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0 0 5.373 0 12zm10 6 6.545-6L10 6v12z" fill="#CF1126"></path></svg><span>“Halftime (Stand Up and Get Crunk!)”</span></span> (2004) are definitive examples. The variety of southern styles will begin to wane by 2007 with the exception of a drug-trade revival style called trap, which will become the most common rap and pop trend in the 2010s. Most heavily produced in Atlanta, trap’s sound is an umbrella term linking various southern regional styles with older styles (like G-funk, house, and techno) and a home-spun, do-it-yourself, entrepreneurial spirit. Trap derives its name from the place (trap house) where drug dealers produce, sell, and use narcotics. Early artists like T.I. and Pusha T of the Clipse paved the way early in the 2000s to make it mainstream. However, the crossover successes of Fetty Wap’s <span class="inline overflow-visible cursor-pointer text-red "><svg fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="inline p-px w-[1em] h-[1em] mr-[0.2em] fill-[red]" style="transform:translateY(-15%)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12s12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0 0 5.373 0 12zm10 6 6.545-6L10 6v12z" fill="#CF1126"></path></svg><span>“Trap Queen”</span></span> (2015) and Migos with Lil Uzi Vert’s “Bad and Boujee” (2017) made rap, R&amp;B, and pop look to trap for musical inspiration. DJs build their sound on a laptop, midi (musical instrumental digital interface), synth pads, keyboards, software, and 808-drum machine. Its restrained simplicity is more complex than one might give credit—manipulating bell timbres, synthetic claps, stuttering the beat, half-time effects, among other DJing techniques. Chicago will borrow extensively renaming it drill rap. While lyrics focus on drug-sales, the sound has been incorporated by non-trap artists like Kendrick Lamar on <span class="inline overflow-visible cursor-pointer text-red "><svg fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="inline p-px w-[1em] h-[1em] mr-[0.2em] fill-[red]" style="transform:translateY(-15%)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12s12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0 0 5.373 0 12zm10 6 6.545-6L10 6v12z" fill="#CF1126"></path></svg><span>“Humble”</span></span> (2017) or cross-over artists like Cardi B on “Bodak Yellow.”</p></section><section class="lazyrender flex flex-col items-center false false false flex flex-col items-center"><div class="w-px h-[64px] sm:h-[100px]" style="background:currentColor"></div><h2 class="font-ui font-bold p-3 w-full max-w-lg border leading-5 text-sm text-center ">Lyrics</h2><div class="w-px h-[64px] sm:h-[100px]" style="background:currentColor"></div></section><section class="false false mb-6 max-w-4xl w-full lazyrender mx-auto font-body text-lg md:text-xl richtext" dividers="[object Object]"><p name="p">Hip-hop is rooted in the African American oral traditions of “boasting” (self-aggrandizement), “toasting” (narrative poems that sometimes bestow praise), “signifyin’” (indirect insults), and “playing the dozens” (competitive and recreational exchange of insults). “Old school” lyrics are characterized by a recreational party style that exploited the art of boasting. MCs, rapping in rhyme, bragged about their verbal skills and/or the technological manipulations of DJs who “rocked the house.” Performances were competitive within and against other crews as heard in the mock MC battle “Showdown” (1981) by the Sugarhill Gang vs. Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five. Kurtis Blow’s “Hard Times” (1980) set the stage for an East Coast style that commented on the economic woes, social ills, and deteriorating conditions of inner-cities, but it was “The Message” (1982) by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five that established this direction as “New School.” Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions and Sister Soulja transformed these social messages into nationalist political commentary, calling for African Americans to reject the destructive forces in their communities and to embrace racial pride as a means toward empowerment. On the West Coast, N.W.A., Ice-T, Ice Cube, 2 Pac and others sought to resist oppressive forces by arming and defending themselves with weapons. These artists use the lyrics of gangsta rap, which provide graphic descriptions of gang culture and the social ills of inner-city communities, to “murder” and “rob” their competitors through street and gang “banging” metaphors. Combining old school boasting with “bad man” imagery, the microphone becomes an automatic weapon for an MC to “murder” his competitor.</p><p name="p">Ice-T’s “Grand Larceny” (1988) employs the metaphor of “robbing” to brag about stealing the show through his superior rapping skills. Such songs have been misinterpreted as being real acts of violence. Gangsta themes continue to overshadow other styles and artists would prove their authenticity as converted, former drug-dealers like Notorious B.I.G. (New York) and UGK (Houston) in the 1990s, 50 Cent (New York) and T.I. (Atlanta) in the 2000s, and Chief Keef (Chicago) and Fetty Wap (New Jersey) in the 2010s. However, with the rise of shooting deaths of unarmed Black men, women, and children by law enforcement officers and vigilantes in the 2010s conscious rappers will re-emerge alongside the activism generated by the Black Lives Matter coalitional movement sparking protests nationwide. J. Cole’s “Be Free” (2014), Joey Bada$$’s “Land of the Free” (2017), and even trap rappers like Pusha T’s “Sunshine” critique the justice system and the lack of accountability. Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” (2014, featuring Pharrell Williams) becomes an anthem of hope and provides a chant for the young, Black protesters: “We gon’ be alright. We gon’ be alright.”</p><p name="p">Women rappers in the 2010s took crafting rap music out of the hands of industry moguls and released self-published songs to the delight of rap fans and rappers anxious to collaborate. Nicki Minaj’s clever rhymes and multiple voices on Kanye West’s “Monster” (2010) highlighted that the new kid among a roster of superstars like Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Rick Ross could outshine the masters. Cardi B’s “I Like It” (2018) is an homage to the 1967 Cuban boogaloo classic “I Like it Like That” by Pete Rodriguez with a hearty, trap rap take that proudly asserts sex-positivity and self-sufficient business women making money through art while paying tribute and owning her Africana-Latina identity.</p></section></div><section class="lazyrender flex flex-col items-center subgrid

Hip-hop music culture is a product of African American, Afro-Caribbean and Latino inner-city communities plagued by poverty, the proliferation of drugs, and gang violence in the 1960s and early 1970s. Some MCs and DJs were members or former members of gangs who used DJing, dancing, and MCing as an alternative to gang warfare. DJ Kool Herc gave the community its blueprints and its first brand of hip-hop music, called b-beat. Hip-hop DJs and MCs originally performed in local house parties and community centers, city parks, neighborhood block parties, and, eventually, local clubs. By the mid-1970s, performance venues included local clubs whose proprietors recognized the commercial potential of this artistic expression. Record and film producers then noticed and began to capitalize on hip-hop culture. Sylvia Robinson of Sugarhill Records introduced rapping into the mainstream with the release of \u003ca href=\"\" data-song-json=\"{\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:239,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Rapper\\u2019s Delight\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;apple_music_song_id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;52310973\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;song_file\u0026quot;:null,\u0026quot;apple_music_attributes\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Rapper\u0026#039;s Delight\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;artist_name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;The Sugarhill Gang\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;album_name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;The Showdown: The Sugarhill Gang Vs.

In the 1980s several commercial hip-hop films such as\u003cem\u003e Wild Style\u003c/em\u003e (1982), \u003cem\u003eStyle Wars\u003c/em\u003e (1983), Beat Street (1984), \u003cem\u003eKrush Groove\u003c/em\u003e (1985) and \u003cem\u003eDisorderlies\u003c/em\u003e (1987) flooded the market with the sound of rap. Major record companies formed partnerships with independent labels and producers specializing in rap music. MCing evolved into the rap music industry while DJing went underground and re-established itself as turntablism (the art of manipulating music with LP records and mixers to create unique rhythms and sounds). Changes to the musical production of hip-hop, along with growing stylistic diversity and advances in technology, led to the community-imposed concept of an old and new school. The “Old School” is associated with the period from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s. Initially, DJs were the featured attraction, juggling beats amplified through large sound speakers and shouting praises and catch-phrases to incite crowd participation. Pioneering DJs include Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa, Grand Wizard Theodore, Grandmaster Flash, and Grandmixer D.ST. When their musical collages and turntable manipulations became so complex that they required their full attention, DJs included a crew of MCs to engage and interact with the crowd of dancers.

Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince (“Parents Just Don’t Understand,” 1988) to the rock-oriented sounds of Run-D.M.C. (“Walk This Way,” 1986). Women rappers like Roxanne Shanté, Salt-n-Pepa, MC Lyte, and Queen Latifah introduced Black women’s point of view to rap fans and proved that they were as skilled and commercially successful as the men.

The hardcore sounds and lyrics of Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, and KRS-One became known as “conscious” rap (also known as “message” and “Afrocentric” rap); those of N.W.A, Ice-T, Ice-Cube, and Eazy-E were called “gangsta” rap. Both styles dominated the hip-hop soundscape through much of the 1990s, but gangsta took over in the 21st century, influencing the styles of Master P, 50 Cent, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Despite this domination, an array of hip-hop styles coexisted, including hybrid productions that fused elements of R\u0026amp;B and/or funk with the beats of hip-hop such as those by MC Hammer, Heavy D and the Boyz, Sean “Puffy” Combs, and Kid ‘n Play.

Kanye West’s production and lyricism redirected attention away from gangsta rap and explored a range of topics including his middle-class upbringing, anti-Black racism, corporatism, and his faith presented in full self-aggrandizing style. Additionally, Eminem will become a most revered lyricist, by rap artists and rap fans alike, breaking past an obstacle of white inauthenticity laid down by Vanilla Ice a decade earlier. Musically, music-making turned away from the East Coast and the West coast and found a new home in the South. Several epicenters develop influential styles: Miami (Miami bass), New Orleans (bounce), Houston (screwed), and Atlanta (crunk and trap). By the 2010s, socially conscious rap will crossover into the mainstream as R\u0026amp;B and rap artists respond to tension borne from increased police and vigilante shootings of unarmed Black men, women, and children, and from advances in technology for self-production and instant sharing through social media. Key artists include Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Joey Bada$$. Equally important in the 2010s is the rise of female MCs as producers of critically acclaimed albums, proving once again that rap consumers will purchase their music.

Performers of the old school (early 1970s–mid-1980s) gained their reputations from live performances. Their recordings are characterized by the use of live bands and/or Latin-influenced percussion; the incorporation of scratching and other turntable effects; call-and-response chants between MCs and crowds; and lyrics delivered in rhymed couplets (A-A-B-B).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew school artists such as Eric B. and Rakim (“Eric B. is President,” 1987) added a virtuoso twist to the A-A-B-B scheme by employing internal rhymes that pair words in the middle of a line rather than simply at the end. The “new school” substituted the aggressive sounds of the street for the party sounds of the old school. This hard-edged aesthetic emphasized dissonance and a heavy backbeat, incorporating real sounds of inner-city life such as gunshots, sirens, street cries, and the occasional political speech. In the 1980s and ’90s, electronic and digital productions of hip-hop increasingly replaced live performances. Synthesizers, drum machines, and computers became the primary instruments and eventually sampled materials from various sources, especially funk, provided the foundation for new songs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the late 1990s some new school artists like the Roots and Guru began reincorporating live instruments into their recordings and during live performances, such as \u003ca href=\"\" data-song-json=\"{\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:310,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Loungin\\u2019\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;apple_music_song_id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;723627329\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;song_file\u0026quot;:null,\u0026quot;apple_music_attributes\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Loungin\u0026#039;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;artist_name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Guru\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;album_name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Jazzmatazz, Vol.1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;release_date\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1993-05-18\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;artwork\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;url\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;https:\\/\\/is1-ssl.mzstatic.com\\/image\\/thumb\\/Music124\\/v4\\/20\\/8a\\/1c\\/208a1c15-f7fd-1cb2-f214-c6d17370da44\\/00094632199850.rgb.jpg\\/{w}x{h}bb.jpg\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;width\u0026quot;:1401,\u0026quot;height\u0026quot;:1401,\u0026quot;bgColor\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0d61b2\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor1\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;fff2ea\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor2\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;c3e6a8\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor3\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;ced5de\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor4\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;9fcbaa\u0026quot;},\u0026quot;preview_song_url\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;https:\\/\\/audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com\\/itunes-assets\\/AudioPreview115\\/v4\\/cc\\/09\\/d7\\/cc09d7a9-2012-34b4-969c-f16d2d7aa71b\\/mzaf_17370066581455237229.plus.aac.p.m4a\u0026quot;},\u0026quot;video_file\u0026quot;:null}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e“Loungin’,”\u003c/a\u003e Guru’s collaboration with jazz great Donald Byrd on trumpet and piano.

The variety of southern styles will begin to wane by 2007 with the exception of a drug-trade revival style called trap, which will become the most common rap and pop trend in the 2010s. Most heavily produced in Atlanta, trap’s sound is an umbrella term linking various southern regional styles with older styles (like G-funk, house, and techno) and a home-spun, do-it-yourself, entrepreneurial spirit. Trap derives its name from the place (trap house) where drug dealers produce, sell, and use narcotics.

MCs, rapping in rhyme, bragged about their verbal skills and/or the technological manipulations of DJs who “rocked the house.” Performances were competitive within and against other crews as heard in the mock MC battle “Showdown” (1981) by the Sugarhill Gang vs. Grandmaster Flash \u0026amp; the Furious Five. Kurtis Blow’s “Hard Times” (1980) set the stage for an East Coast style that commented on the economic woes, social ills, and deteriorating conditions of inner-cities, but it was “The Message” (1982) by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five that established this direction as “New School.” Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions and Sister Soulja transformed these social messages into nationalist political commentary, calling for African Americans to reject the destructive forces in their communities and to embrace racial pride as a means toward empowerment. On the West Coast, N.W.A., Ice-T, Ice Cube, 2 Pac and others sought to resist oppressive forces by arming and defending themselves with weapons. These artists use the lyrics of gangsta rap, which provide graphic descriptions of gang culture and the social ills of inner-city communities, to “murder” and “rob” their competitors through street and gang “banging” metaphors. Combining old school boasting with “bad man” imagery, the microphone becomes an automatic weapon for an MC to “murder” his competitor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIce-T’s “Grand Larceny” (1988) employs the metaphor of “robbing” to brag about stealing the show through his superior rapping skills. Such songs have been misinterpreted as being real acts of violence. Gangsta themes continue to overshadow other styles and artists would prove their authenticity as converted, former drug-dealers like Notorious B.I.G. (New York) and UGK (Houston) in the 1990s, 50 Cent (New York) and T.I. (Atlanta) in the 2000s, and Chief Keef (Chicago) and Fetty Wap (New Jersey) in the 2010s. However, with the rise of shooting deaths of unarmed Black men, women, and children by law enforcement officers and vigilantes in the 2010s conscious rappers will re-emerge alongside the activism generated by the Black Lives Matter coalitional movement sparking protests nationwide. J. Cole’s “Be Free” (2014), Joey Bada$$’s “Land of the Free” (2017), and even trap rappers like Pusha T’s “Sunshine” critique the justice system and the lack of accountability. Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” (2014, featuring Pharrell Williams) becomes an anthem of hope and provides a chant for the young, Black protesters: “We gon’ be alright. We gon’ be alright.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWomen rappers in the 2010s took crafting rap music out of the hands of industry moguls and released self-published songs to the delight of rap fans and rappers anxious to collaborate. Nicki Minaj’s clever rhymes and multiple voices on Kanye West’s “Monster” (2010) highlighted that the new kid among a roster of superstars like Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Rick Ross could outshine the masters. Cardi B’s “I Like It” (2018) is an homage to the 1967 Cuban boogaloo classic “I Like it Like That” by Pete Rodriguez with a hearty, trap rap take that proudly asserts sex-positivity and self-sufficient business women making money through art while paying tribute and owning her Africana-Latina identity.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"text","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":13,"content":[],"type":"bibliography-collection","medias":[],"children":[{"content":{"bibliography":"Chang, Jeff.

The music appeared in Asian countries and the Philippines during the 1920s and flourished thereafter. Black singers, dancers, and musicians such as Teddy Weatherford performed in Asia, the Pacific Isles, and, in particular, the cities of Yokohama, Shanghai, and Bombay during the 1930s.

In the 1880s, publishing companies began to converge in an area of New York City that came to be known as Tin Pan Alley, initially without a single African American firm among them. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), founded in 1914 to reap the fruits of the Copyright Act of 1909, generally skewed its membership toward composers of pop tunes and semi-serious works. Of the society’s 170 charter members, only six were African American. Most Black artists were excluded from the Society and thereby denied the full benefits of copyright protection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSound recording proceeded on a different path. Early demonstrations of Thomas Edison’s “talking machine” recorded people whistling, singing, telling stories, and playing musical instruments. Many ethnic groups—their humor, folklore, and cultural values—were introduced to each other and to the mainstream public through the medium of sound recording. Nearly 40 African American artists, ranging from minstrels and touring vaudevillians to notable quartets, representing blues, jazz, ragtime, cabaret and classical music, recorded during the formative years of sound recording (1890-1919). Many of these recordings have only recently been recovered as part of the history of African American music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThings changed in 1920 when Mamie Smith’s recording of “Crazy Blues” started selling 7,500 copies per week.

The initial success of the “race market” encouraged the formation of a handful of Black-owned independent labels, including Sunshine in Los Angeles and Meritt in Kansas City. Harry Pace and W. C. Handy started Black Swan in 1921. Mayo “Ink” Williams founded Black Patti in 1927. Notably, not a single Black-owned label survived the Great Depression intact.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"text","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":4,"content":{"text":"Radio, Records, and Rhythm \u0026 Blues"},"type":"title","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":5,"content":{"text":"\u003cp\u003eAs African Americans were making headway as recording artists, the birth of commercial broadcasting in 1920 threatened the survival of the recording industry as a whole.

By 1939, ASCAP had alienated radio with its excessive licensing demands, so the National Alliance of Broadcasters formed its own performing rights organization—Broadcast Music Incorporated. BMI challenged ASCAP’s monopoly on copyrighted music by signing up blues and country writers, including scores of African American artists writing and performing rhythm and blues. Their blues-based sound, with honking sax players and blues shouters at the mike, presented a more raucous energy than the big swing bands of the era and deviated significantly from the smooth and melodic sound of mainstream Black pop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIgnored by the major companies, a number of independent R\u0026amp;B labels came into existence in New York (Atlantic), Newark (Savoy), Cincinnati (King), Chicago (Chess), Houston (Peacock), and Los Angeles (Modern, Imperial, and Specialty).

Club DJs organized themselves into “record pools” for the distribution of new releases and word-of-mouth promotion.

In the end, perhaps all those African American artists and entrepreneurs who were downsized by the major labels in the name of profitability and economies of scale will have the last laugh by finding a comfortable and lucrative home in the digital world.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"text","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":21,"type":"related-genres","musical-features":[{"id":52,"title":"Blues Form"},{"id":63,"title":"Sampling"},{"id":279,"title":"Electronic Sounds"}],"instruments":[{"id":18,"title":"Saxophone"},{"id":35,"title":"Voice"},{"id":150,"title":"Other Electronic Instruments"}],"themes":[{"id":148,"title":"Dance"},{"id":153,"title":"Entertainment"},{"id":304,"title":"Racism/Discrimination"}],"children":[]},{"position":22,"content":[],"type":"author-reference","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":23,"content":{"text":"Bibliography"},"type":"title","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":24,"content":{"text":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eBricker,\u0026nbsp;Rebecca.\u0026nbsp;“Take One,”\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003ePeople\u003c/em\u003e, 4 April 1983.Southern,\u0026nbsp;Eileen.\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eThe Music of Black Americans: A History\u003c/em\u003e, 3rd ed.

Given New Orleans’s geographic location on the Gulf of Mexico, the city has historically functioned as much as a northern outpost of the Caribbean as it has a cultural center of the American South. The same is true of other Southern American cities, such as Miami, that have maintained a vigorous musical exchange with nearby islands like Jamaica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico through the migration of populations, the physical circulation of sound recordings, and regional radio broadcasts that could be accessed when weather permitted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut jazz also has a prominent history throughout sub-Saharan Africa. As the American popular music that developed concurrently with the earliest years of the American broadcast industry, jazz was the first American popular style to impact the region. This was particularly true in the Anglophone areas. Jazz had a tremendous impact in South Africa throughout the mid-20th century, resulting in a thriving jazz scene that gave birth to internationally known musicians such as Hugh Masekela, Miriam Makeba, and Abdullah Ibrahim (Dollar Brand). American jazz musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis encouraged African musicians to create their own hybrid jazz form drawing from their heritage.

In these areas, musicians such as Arsenio Rodríguez, El Septeto Habanero, and Johnny Pacheco provided the soundtrack of African independence. By the 1970s, Jamaican reggae had become a musical force throughout sub-Saharan Africa due to the popularity of Bob Marley and other Jamaican musicians and remained highly influential until the 1990s when digital methods of musical production rooted in American hip-hop paved the way for African electronic dance music such as kwaito (South Africa), kuduro (Angola), hip-life (Ghana), Senegalese rap, and Nigerian hip-hop.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"text","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":8,"type":"related-genres","musical-features":[{"id":277,"title":"Rhythms"},{"id":278,"title":"Beat"},{"id":279,"title":"Electronic Sounds"}],"instruments":[{"id":3,"title":"Bass"},{"id":11,"title":"Drums"}],"themes":[{"id":21,"title":"Migration"},{"id":32,"title":"Slavery"},{"id":303,"title":"Black Power/Pride"}],"children":[]},{"position":9,"content":{"text":"\u003cp\u003eThe flip side of this cross-cultural conversation has been equally charged, albeit articulated on different terms.

Depending on the location and circumstances, emphasizing the African elements in Afro-diasporic music has spanned a range from the teasing out of implicit African traits, to the foregrounding of explicit traits, to various forms of musical imagining intended to reconstruct lost African traits. Generally speaking, it wasn’t until the decades following World War II that people of African descent in the Americas had access to any substantial information about African music and culture in general, and it was primarily the political energy of decolonization that powered awareness of African culture throughout the diaspora.

Reggae of the 1970s, for example, was strongly infused with the values of the Rastafarian religion, which emphasized Africa as the cultural homeland of all diasporic Africans. The salsa dura (hard salsa) produced in New York reflected Latino-Americans’ proximity to the Civil Rights struggle, and their own embrace of the Africanist elements that were a fundamental part of Spanish Caribbean culture. Artists such as Ismael Rivera, Willie Colón, and Celia Cruz strongly promoted the Africanist element in Latino culture, drawing frequently upon the imagery of Santería, the Yoruba religion practiced by descendants of African slaves in the Spanish Caribbean. Meanwhile, jazz artists such as John Coltrane and Miles Davis were working through their own imaginative reconstructions of African music through their work in modal jazz and jazz-rock fusion, respectively.

Butler, Samuel Delany, Ytasha L. Womack, Ishmael Reed, and Mark Dery who coined the term in 1992. Even the great Zora Neale Hurston has been described as an Afrofuturist. And when the focus shifts to Black music, the following names often appear: Sun Ra, Parliament-Funkadelic, Grace Jones, OutKast, Erykah Badu, Flying Lotus, and Janelle Monáe. But While Afrofuturism has been characterized as a philosophy, a movement, and a cultural aesthetic, among other things, there has been little discussion of the spiritual principles that essentially comprise the conceptual foundation of Afrofuturism in music. Several prominent characteristics associated with Afrofuturism, particularly flight and freedom, are manifestations of a spiritual ethos that shaped Black musicians’ worldviews and approaches to music-making in four centuries. It’s widely known that Sun Ra projected values, viewpoints, and images that we conceptualize as Afrofuturism before the term became operative. But the spiritual metaphysics that gave rise to Afrofuturist characteristics are seldom discussed.

But If we think of Afrofuturism as a search for “cosmic liberation” and “possibility in a world meant to destroy any and all forms of Black life,” as Shanté Paradigm Smalls has stated, we can think of the Spiritual “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” as a precursor. Certainly, the enslaved singers who composed and sang these lyrics (“Swing low, sweet chariot / Coming for to carry me home”) associated flight with freedom and “appropriate[d] images of technology and a prosthetically enhanced future.” Indeed, they sang these words long before Orville and Wilbur Wright flew in the world’s first powered aircraft. Yet it’s equally important to understand that the song’s futuristic impulse is part and parcel of its liberationist impulse.

The mid-20th century witnessed the first inklings of Afrofuturism in jazz and rhythm and blues. Sun Ra’s 1948 home recording “Deep Purple” included notes that later became associated with extraterrestrial signals. A few years later, in 1952, he organized a small band, the Space Trio, which became the foundation for his Arkestra, a larger band he created in 1953, modeled on swing bands, such as those of Fletcher Henderson, who inspired and mentored Ra as a young musician. But even in his remembrance of Henderson’s musicianship, Ra underscored spirituality. “Fletcher was part of an angelic thing,” he said. “A lot of things that some men do…come from somewhere else, or they’re inspired by something that’s not of this planet.” While some might attribute Ra’s comments to mere adulation, they actually reflect a mental process or conceptual approach to music-making.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"text","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":9,"content":[],"type":"media-collection","medias":[],"children":[{"content":{"credit":"DISTRIBUTED BY IMPULSE!

That Betty Davis, Chaka Khan, George Clinton, and Bootsy Collins expressed admiration for Hendrix, provides some semblance of his impact. Davis prefigured Megan Thee Stallion’s aesthetic. Khan is known as the Queen of Funk. Clinton led the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, and Collins cut his teeth playing with James Brown and later joined P-Funk, mesmerizing audiences with his uniquely designed “space bass.” Hendrix was therefore a rare musician who received great respect from musicians who played jazz, rock, blues, and rhythm and blues. Where jazz musicians generally expressed thoughts and feelings in wordless sound, notwithstanding Sun Ra’s forays into film and poetry, Hendrix demonstrated that it was possible to foreground Afrofuturist sensibilities with imaginative lyrics. And he accentuated the effect by developing a distinctive form of theatricality based on styles pioneered by guitarist T-Bone Walker, which became common features of blues performances during Hendrix’s apprenticeship playing the Chitlin’ Circuit. Hendrix’s audiences witnessed fluid, vernacular, dance gestures performed in androgenous, rock-inflected outfits that showcased a contrarian spirit of total rebellion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFunk artists elaborated on Hendrix’s model in the 1970s. Davis, LaBelle, Parliament-Funkadelic, Earth, Wind \u0026amp; Fire and other artists showcased elements of Afrofuturism during this period. Women songwriters played an invaluable role. Francesca Royster has discussed Nona Hendryx’s work in her analysis of LaBelle, but Davis’s contributions to Afrofuturism have been largely ignored. Part of the difficulty is that her songwriting doesn’t highlight such themes. Rather, Betty Davis projected an Afrofuturist image in live performances that exemplified her largely southern, blues-based sensibility. Recall Ray Charles’s expression of gutbucket blues in “Cosmic Ray.” Thus, Davis remarked, “The one thing that I wish was an advantage, but isn’t, is being the first to do something. I made it easier for people like Patti LaBelle and Chaka Khan. Hell, I even had a silver space suit…when Labelle were still in jeans.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDavis’s simultaneous embracing of past and future realms of blackness, which typifies Afrofuturism, also exemplified conceptual elements of funk aesthetics, which tends to delight in commingling contrasts, incongruities, paradoxes, and presumed oppositions, while demonstrating aversions toward simplistic, either/or logic as well as a preference for contrarian or eccentric expression. Even the word “funk” signifies good (e.g., artistic excellence) and bad (e.g. foul smell), depending on its context. Most discussions of Davis highlight her irreverent aesthetic and attitude regarding gender and sexuality. Her songs often describe Black working-class women’s experiences in street culture; and again, she rarely, if ever, describes space travel as such. But Davis’s space-age outfit, photographed on the cover of her 1974 album \u003cem\u003eThey Say I’m Different\u003c/em\u003e, represented one component of a broader, theatrical form of visual and musical storytelling that other funk artists embellished into funklore—what George Clinton calls funk operas.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"text","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":23,"content":[],"type":"media-collection","medias":[],"children":[{"content":{"credit":"Discogs.com/UFOXY3LP","caption":"\u003cp\u003eThe album cover for Betty Davis’s “They Say I'm Different”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"media-collection-item","media_full_url":"https://carnegie-hall.imgix.net/7c1229f6-63bf-424e-9ed2-77dfc309f00c/discogs_betty_davis_album_cover_they_say_im_different.jpeg","medias":[{"alt_text":"Betty Davis Album Cover They Say I'm Different","width":600,"height":600,"caption":"Betty Davis Album Cover They Say I'm Different","pivot":{"crop":"desktop","crop_w":600,"crop_h":338,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":113,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"desktop"}},{"alt_text":"Betty Davis Album Cover They Say I'm Different","width":600,"height":600,"caption":"Betty Davis Album Cover They Say I'm Different","pivot":{"crop":"tablet","crop_w":600,"crop_h":450,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":94,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"tablet"}},{"alt_text":"Betty Davis Album Cover They Say I'm Different","width":600,"height":600,"caption":"Betty Davis Album Cover They Say I'm Different","pivot":{"crop":"mobile","crop_w":600,"crop_h":600,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":0,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"mobile"}}],"files":[]},{"content":{"credit":null,"caption":"\u003cp\u003ePromotional photo of singing group Labelle in 1975.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"media-collection-item","media_full_url":"https://carnegie-hall.imgix.net/2b5086d8-4c02-4b27-b213-d5e739af7b26/Labelle_1975.jpeg","medias":[{"alt_text":"Labelle 1975","width":661,"height":518,"caption":"Labelle 1975","pivot":{"crop":"desktop","crop_w":661,"crop_h":370,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":130,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"desktop"}},{"alt_text":"Labelle 1975","width":661,"height":518,"caption":"Labelle 1975","pivot":{"crop":"tablet","crop_w":661,"crop_h":496,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":16,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"tablet"}},{"alt_text":"Labelle 1975","width":661,"height":518,"caption":"Labelle 1975","pivot":{"crop":"mobile","crop_w":517,"crop_h":518,"crop_x":65,"crop_y":0,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"mobile"}}],"files":[]}]},{"position":24,"content":{"text":"\u003cp\u003eYet women funk artists interpreted Afrofuturism in noticeably gendered and sexual terms.

By incorporating theatrical elements, visuals, and technologies, funk artists paved new ground in American musical history. For Davis, using technology imaginatively as a blues-oriented thinker involved conceptualizing her voice as a “projector,” that is, a musical instrument. For LaBelle, it meant using glam-rock outfits with space-travel imagery and performing songs like Hendryx’s “Space Children” expressed funk-inflected values such as love, harmony, and balance, which is evident when the narrator proclaims: “Space children, universal lovers.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat Parliament-Funkadelic covered “Space Children” in live performances indicates LaBelle’s impact. Parliament-Funkadelic (P-Funk) experimented more extensively with Afrofuturism than any other funk collectives. Only Sun Ra and perhaps Janelle Monáe exceed the depth, output, and overall contribution that Parliament-Funkadelic made to Afrofuturism in music. The most obvious example of the collective’s use of technology involved the proverbial Mothership, that is, an actual spaceship that landed onstage during live performances. But on a more basic level, the Mothership was blues-oriented satire akin to the great comedian Moms Mabley’s criticisms of misogyny. Since Black folk were marginalized in American society, Clinton figured that he would fly them to outer space. And the comical thing is that Black people weren’t supposed to exist in space. Popular culture created the impression that space was for white people only. But the Mothership symbolized an extraterrestrial atmosphere where Black folk could be themselves regardless and reclaim their blackness in the context of an integrated society.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"text","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":25,"content":[],"type":"media-collection","medias":[],"children":[{"content":{"credit":"Fuzheado, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons","caption":"\u003cp\u003eP-Funk Mothership at the National Museum of African American History and Culture opening in Washington, DC.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"media-collection-item","media_full_url":"https://carnegie-hall.imgix.net/c49ed804-8ddb-4594-b34c-c5418c5f6cee/P-Funk_mothership_at_NMAAHC.jpg","medias":[{"alt_text":"P-Funk mothership at NMAAHC","width":720,"height":500,"caption":"P-Funk mothership at NMAAHC","pivot":{"crop":"desktop","crop_w":720,"crop_h":404,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":16,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"desktop"}},{"alt_text":"P-Funk mothership at NMAAHC","width":720,"height":500,"caption":"P-Funk mothership at NMAAHC","pivot":{"crop":"tablet","crop_w":665,"crop_h":500,"crop_x":16,"crop_y":0,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"tablet"}},{"alt_text":"P-Funk mothership at NMAAHC","width":720,"height":500,"caption":"P-Funk mothership at NMAAHC","pivot":{"crop":"mobile","crop_w":500,"crop_h":500,"crop_x":16,"crop_y":0,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"mobile"}}],"files":[]},{"content":{"caption":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr class=\"softbreak\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","youtube_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJvjWh2Vhu4"},"type":"media-collection-item","medias":[],"files":[]}]},{"position":26,"content":{"text":"\u003cp\u003eModeled after the sci-fi television series \u003cem\u003eStar Trek\u003c/em\u003e, the Mothership was commandeered by Dr. Funkenstein (George Clinton) and the Children of Production, especially “Star Child.” And the flight or \u003ca href=\"https://admin.cms.timeline.carnegiehall.org/stories/18/\" data-song-json=\"{\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:487,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Mothership Connection (Star Child)\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;apple_music_song_id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1440837690\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;song_file\u0026quot;:null,\u0026quot;apple_music_attributes\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Mothership Connection (Star Child)\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;artist_name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Parliament\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;album_name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Mothership Connection\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;release_date\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1975-12-15\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;artwork\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;url\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;https:\\/\\/is3-ssl.mzstatic.com\\/image\\/thumb\\/Music118\\/v4\\/b3\\/dc\\/3a\\/b3dc3af0-b044-6914-1cdf-2ba2c8b36169\\/00602547748492.rgb.jpg\\/{w}x{h}bb.jpg\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;width\u0026quot;:3000,\u0026quot;height\u0026quot;:3000,\u0026quot;bgColor\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1c2f2b\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor1\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;bbd9de\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor2\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;fa9827\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor3\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;9bb7ba\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor4\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;cd8328\u0026quot;},\u0026quot;preview_song_url\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;https:\\/\\/audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com\\/itunes-assets\\/AudioPreview125\\/v4\\/e0\\/8d\\/df\\/e08ddf79-36be-0b30-00fe-0a08fc6f7646\\/mzaf_2684682876647683579.plus.aac.p.m4a\u0026quot;},\u0026quot;video_file\u0026quot;:null}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e“Mothership Connection (Star Child)”\u003c/a\u003e represented a quasi-religious experience that the late composer and musicologist Olly Wilson called an “altered state of consciousness.” In fact, the hook (“Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride”) alludes to refrain in the Spiritual “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.” The “‘Mothership Connection,’” writes journalist Chardine Taylor-Stone, “brought [Black people] the holy Funk (the source of life) so they could make the journey to their true home in outer space” where such values as peace, harmony, and balance are normalized.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaylor-Stone’s reference to “home in outer space” is a great example of Baraka’s statement that stellar Black musicians create “[a]n energy that take[s]…everybody…on a trip.

Brown’s father is singer, saxophonist, and flutist Jimmy Brown who was known for his falsetto as a member of Brick, the Atlanta-based funk band. Sleepy Brown’s high falsetto on “Player’s Ball” extends this approach by noted funk singers like Curtis Mayfield, Philip Bailey, Garry Shider, and, of course, Jimmy Brown among others. The ethnomusicologist Fredara Mareva Hadley drives this point home when she writes: “With lyrical influences and abundant samples, funk is the midwife of hip-hop.

He says that “God” “speak[s] through” the rap duo and rhymes that OutKast feels compelled to be “sincere with this here.” Incidentally, Benjamin’s meaning of “sincere” is identical with the core meaning of “funk:” utmost emotional sincerity. And in the context of his storytelling, sincerity meant abstaining from intoxicants to “get [God’s] signal clear.” His phrase reflects considerable self-consciousness, particularly the capacity to question norms and the extent to which our actions reflect such influenced. Like blues artists before him, Benjamin’s verse tells a story of how he confronted his contradiction: the artist curtailed his use of guns because his spirituality constitutes a “stronger” and more resourceful “weapon.”\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"text","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":31,"content":[],"type":"media-collection","medias":[],"children":[{"content":{"caption":null,"youtube_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktc9hsSfUck"},"type":"media-collection-item","medias":[],"files":[]},{"content":{"credit":"Joe Goldberg, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons","caption":"\u003cp\u003eOutKast at the Area:One Music Festival in 2001.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"media-collection-item","media_full_url":"https://carnegie-hall.imgix.net/6782eb8d-af68-4f2f-ac4f-75bd45df7422/OutKast_2001_600x600.jpg","medias":[{"alt_text":"Outkast 2001","width":600,"height":600,"caption":"Outkast performing in 2001","pivot":{"crop":"desktop","crop_w":600,"crop_h":338,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":131,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"desktop"}},{"alt_text":"Outkast 2001","width":600,"height":600,"caption":"Outkast performing in 2001","pivot":{"crop":"tablet","crop_w":600,"crop_h":450,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":113,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"tablet"}},{"alt_text":"Outkast 2001","width":600,"height":600,"caption":"Outkast performing in 2001","pivot":{"crop":"mobile","crop_w":600,"crop_h":600,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":0,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"mobile"}}],"files":[]}]},{"position":32,"content":{"text":"\u003cp\u003eBy contrast, Badu exemplifies the Afrofuturist question of “what if” through a Black woman’s lens.

The universe comes out of a wombiverse.” In Badu’s songwriting, water symbolizes birth, life, resilience, and/or the lack thereof. The narrator in “On \u0026amp; On” (1997) “was born under water.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe music video for “Didn’t Cha Know,” appears on her album \u003cem\u003eMama’s Gun \u003c/em\u003e(2000), shows contrasting imagery. The opening scene shows an expanse of cracked, arid, sunbaked soil with a flashing yellow light in the distance. The historical and geographical settings remain unclear. Is this post-apocalyptic earth or the beginning of life on a new planet? Badu’s Egyptian-styled space suit accentuates the ambiguity that parallels the story in the song. Reminiscent of blues singers who sang about predicaments that precluded indecision, Badu’s narrator has reached a crossroads. But unlike Robert Johnson’s “Crossroad Road Blues,” wherein the narrator begs God for “mercy,” presumably for sinning and singing blues, Badu’s first-person narrator confesses our collective experience of confusion in this land: “trying to decide which way to go/Think I made a wrong turn back there.” This theme of indecision at the crossroads recurs throughout the song, and Badu resolves the conflict in the outro when she asserts the blues-tinged principle of resilience and rebirth. Equating life and love, Badu sings, “Free you mind and find your way,” which invokes Funkadelic’s album \u003cem\u003eFree Your Mind… and Your Ass Will Follow \u003c/em\u003e(1970). In the video, Badu is heard singing this line while she emerges with her naked body from the depths of a water hole that is itself suggestive of a birth canal.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"text","medias":[],"children":[]},{"position":33,"content":[],"type":"media-collection","medias":[],"children":[{"content":{"caption":"\u003cp\u003eMusic video for “Didn’t Cha Know” by Erykah Badu\u003cbr class=\"softbreak\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","browsers":{"musicVideos":[10]}},"type":"media-collection-item","music_videos":[{"id":10,"title":"Didn’t Cha Know – Erykah Badu","apple_music_video_attributes":{"name":"Didn't Cha Know (Edited Master)","artist_name":"Erykah Badu","album_name":null,"release_date":"2007-01-01","artwork":{"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video128/v4/6a/8a/b1/6a8ab108-9582-af3b-4e83-1f2c329739d8/Universal.270435419.00602498871478_USUV70501745.CROPPED.mzi.pkdsufxp.jpg/{w}x{h}mv.jpg","width":640,"height":709,"bgColor":"b09174","textColor1":"170c01","textColor2":"23190f","textColor3":"352718","textColor4":"3f3123"},"preview_video_url":"https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video125/v4/5e/3a/14/5e3a1470-cce4-1e16-647f-090f255d8ccf/mzvf_3919802121431049685.640x480.h264lc.U.p.m4v"}}],"medias":[],"files":[]},{"content":{"credit":"Patrik Hamberg, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons","caption":"\u003cp\u003eErykah Badu performing in 2009.\u003c/p\u003e"},"type":"media-collection-item","media_full_url":"https://carnegie-hall.imgix.net/d28619d7-6f75-4c7c-baed-c031a06f6c0c/Erykah_Badu_600x600.jpg","medias":[{"alt_text":"Erykah Badu in 2009","width":600,"height":600,"caption":"Erykah Badu in 2009","pivot":{"crop":"desktop","crop_w":600,"crop_h":338,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":150,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"desktop"}},{"alt_text":"Erykah Badu in 2009","width":600,"height":600,"caption":"Erykah Badu in 2009","pivot":{"crop":"tablet","crop_w":600,"crop_h":450,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":131,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"tablet"}},{"alt_text":"Erykah Badu in 2009","width":600,"height":600,"caption":"Erykah Badu in 2009","pivot":{"crop":"mobile","crop_w":600,"crop_h":600,"crop_x":0,"crop_y":0,"lqip_data":null,"ratio":"mobile"}}],"files":[]}]},{"position":34,"content":{"text":"\u003cp\u003eThat Badu described her 2015 mixtape \u003ca href=\"https://admin.cms.timeline.carnegiehall.org/stories/18/\" data-song-json=\"{\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:496,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Caint Use My Phone (Suite)\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;apple_music_song_id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1442979883\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;song_file\u0026quot;:null,\u0026quot;apple_music_attributes\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Caint Use My Phone (Suite)\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;artist_name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Erykah Badu\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;album_name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;But You Caint Use My Phone (Mixtape)\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;release_date\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2015-11-27\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;artwork\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;url\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;https:\\/\\/is5-ssl.mzstatic.com\\/image\\/thumb\\/Music124\\/v4\\/d1\\/70\\/16\\/d170169d-0002-457a-aa81-26e84d3c8657\\/00602547719713.rgb.jpg\\/{w}x{h}bb.jpg\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;width\u0026quot;:3000,\u0026quot;height\u0026quot;:3000,\u0026quot;bgColor\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;ffffff\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor1\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;000000\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor2\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;010e70\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor3\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;333333\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;textColor4\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;343e8d\u0026quot;},\u0026quot;preview_song_url\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;https:\\/\\/audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com\\/itunes-assets\\/AudioPreview125\\/v4\\/93\\/6c\\/73\\/936c73ee-1a9b-a85b-ebf0-0cd6a9808da7\\/mzaf_995938979314304692.plus.aac.p.m4a\u0026quot;},\u0026quot;video_file\u0026quot;:null}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut You Caint Use My Phone\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eas “a whole new frequency for the planet” seems quite fitting.

Included on her 2013 album \u003cem\u003eThe Electric Lady\u003c/em\u003e, the song’s title is an acronym for the following marginalized groups: queer people, untouchables, emigrants, excommunicated, Negroid. And as Monáe demonstrates, all these words cohere with the meaning of “freak.” “Am I a freak because I love watching Mary?” she sings. Badu’s genius is that she inverted the denigrating term into an emblem of (Black) feminist respect: Q.U.E.E.N. Ytasha L. Womack might as well have specified Monáe when she said Afrofuturism involves “speculation about the future rife with cultural critiques.” Chief among which is the narrow-minded, zero-sum, either-or logic that informs capitalism’s social constructions of gender and sexuality. Monáe visually projects alternatives through her both/and sensibility reflected in her androgenous image. In the “Q.U.E.E.N” video, Monáe wears her signature tuxedo with a pair of heels. Her pompadour hairstyle recalls pre-1968 photographs of the Godfather of Soul a.k.a. James Brown. The uniform reflects her own experiences and those of her family members as part of their economic survival. Monáe worked as a maid; her mother worked as a janitor; her stepfather worked a postal worker; and her father worked as a trash collector.

In fact, on the website for Wondaland Arts Society, the Atlanta-based collective that Monáe cofounded, the opening statement reads: “We survive on Funk.” Shortly thereafter, the following statement appears: “We believe songs are spaceships. We believe music is the weapon of the future.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with Clinton’s Dr. Funkenstein, Monáe’s songs revolve around her alter ego, Cindy Mayweather, an android from the year 2719. But Monáe’s queer politics and her brilliant use of sci-fi films as a primary touchstone distinguish her from other Afrofuturists. Essentially, she elaborated on theatrical aspects in funk aesthetics and used the technology of film to represent the multifaceted nature of human and non-human lifeforms in an unprecedented manner, all while centering music as a form of storytelling. Where Clinton used Star Trek as a touchstone to highlight vernacular aesthetics in an age-old conflict concerning class divisions among African Americans, and where OutKast starred in the 2008 musical Idlewild to showcase their dirty-South aesthetic, Monáe’s approach to the sci-fi film genre is comparable to a musician’s discovery of a new instrument. It opens new realms of representation and artistic possibilities. She created the term “emotion picture” to reference her short films and videos that accompany her albums.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMonáe introduced her alter ego on her EP \u003cem\u003eMetropolis (\u003c/em\u003e2008), which was inspired by Fritz Lang’s 1927 science fiction film Metropolis. Then she developed the character in the two concept albums that followed \u003cem\u003eThe ArchAndroid \u003c/em\u003e(2010) and \u003cem\u003eThe Electric Lady \u003c/em\u003e(2013). The latter evokes Jimi Hendrix’s 1968 album \u003cem\u003eElectric Ladyland \u003c/em\u003eand Electric Lady Studios, the recording studio he commissioned.

Even the sound of Monáe’s music has been described as “a sci-fi cinema soundtrack.” Yet there are parallels with Clinton’s funk operas. Just as the funkmaster converted the sci-fi dichotomy (i.e., human/good versus non-human/evil) into allegories of funk (wherein Dr. Funkenstein and his crew extolled previously demeaned values as positive or good), Monáe created Cindi as a symbolic figure whose exploitation and alienation invoke ongoing forms of margination in present-day America.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly enough, listeners learn much about Cindi from liner notes included on compact discs for \u003cem\u003eThe ArchAndroid \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eThe Electric Lady. \u003c/em\u003eOf course, liner notes are yet another page from the past. Record companies used them to introduce jazz musicians and their compositions on albums in the 1950s and 1960s. But Monáe’s versions are miniature short stories: fictional accounts written in letter-format by a fictional author named Max Stellings. As Vice Chancellor at the Palace of the Dogs Arts Asylum, Stellings reveals that Monáe is Patient #57821 at the asylum. “Dear Listener,” he begins. Then he tells the dystopian story of Metropolis. We learn that the patient Monáe is the genius behind the beautiful songs and imagery on the banned albums; that she has been “snatched,” “genoraped,” and “sold illegally to the highest bidder on a body farm;” that her DNA was stolen; that she was “forced into a time tunnel and sent back to our era;” and that her DNA was used to create the android Cindi Mayweather who lives in 2719 and creates a new form of music called cybersoul. She accordingly achieves rock-star status and becomes the leader of a rebellious, android movement. As such, Cindi is the Arch Android. Her ultimate transgression, though, is her forbidden love affair with Anthony Greendown, a human. And quite naturally, Cindi’s story of forbidden love between an android and a human is a thinly disguised reference to xenophobia and homophobia in everyday American life.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut while Monáe and Clinton certainly address alienation from different vantage points, she echoes his credo that dancing is a major fault line of social inequities.

In her “Tightrope” video, Monáe literally performs the song’s metaphor: that for Black folk, navigating through life in a world of “haters” requires so much psychological balance and emotional resilience that the immense challenges are like “tip[ping] on [a] tightrope.” Thus she (or is it Cindi?) urges listeners: “keep getting funky on the scene.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, at several points in the song Monáe sings, “Now put some voodoo on it.” This line appears on the Wondaland Arts Society website, indicating its significance.

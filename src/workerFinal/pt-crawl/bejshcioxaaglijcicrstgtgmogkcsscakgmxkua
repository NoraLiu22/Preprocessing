The entire population of Europe between 16&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP and 11&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP likely averaged some 30&nbsp;000 individuals, and between 40&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP and 16&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP, it was even lower at 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;–&nbsp;6&nbsp;000 individuals. </b><br /><br />Source: https://worldhistoryconnected.press.uillinois.edu/6.3/christian.html</p><br clear ="all">This indicates that the population was kept artificially low by use of population limiting cultural practices. This could arise using a number of means, all available to the people of those times: <br /><br />• <b>Prolonged nursing of newborns</b><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the resulting lack of fertility for at the very least six months, perhaps a lot longer. <br /><br /> • <b>Sexual abstention</b><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is easier than it sounds - all that is necessary is for fertile women to be denied a husband, and vice versa, for a significant period of their reproductive lives. Historically that was achieved by women not being allowed to marry until they had reached a certain age, and/or until a suitable partner was found, thus truncating their possible reproductive life. There are various mechanisms to achieve this goal, and the systems can be very complex.    <br /><br />• <b>Food taboos</b><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to reduce protein, carbohydrates and fat intake for women who were  likely to become pregnant, rendering them infertile. In modern times, elite female athletes may experience a loss of menstruation and thus fertility because of low fat levels, low body weight, and the effects of exercise related hormones. <br /><br />  • <b>Infanticide</b><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could take the form of abandonment/exposure, suffocation, or  ritual sacrifice, all methods which have been used in the times before agriculture. Neglect and intentional malnourishment may also have occurred.  Even after agriculture was adopted, exposure of newborns was widely practiced in ancient Greece.  It may have been that female children were more likely to be the objects of infanticide, further lowering the birth rate.  As with present hunter/gatherer societies, they knew perfectly well how many people they could feed, and in times of shortage would have abandoned or killed unwanted children. <br /><br /><br /><br />With regard to population control,  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Hayden (1972)</span></a> writes that the threat of famine was close to non-existent in hunter gatherers. In fact, they had a routine and reliable food base, even in the worst conditions, and those in better environments enjoyed an even more substantial food supply. They eat whatever is available, whether it be of animal or vegetable or marine origin, but they usually had a great abundance of food.  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Hayden (1972)</span></a> write that starvation in tropical and temperate regions was only amongst individuals incapacitated for other reasons. The only well documented cases of privation and starvation come from the arctic, sub-arctic, and extreme desert. <br /><br />Thus, if hunter gatherers  had acted in a normal predator/prey arrangement, they would have increased in numbers until each had enough to live on, perhaps, but there would often have been lean days, and a bad year would cause many to starve. By not increasing their numbers, and maintaining a high ratio of food to numbers, they had a good life. This is only possible if there are effective controls on population. <br /><br /> Malthus proposed that populations should increase to the maximum number that the environment would support, resulting in a minimum of resources per person. Amongst most modern hunter/gatherers there is a superabundance of resources per capita. In fact most groups work only 2 to 5 hours per person per day, and density has been estimated at 20% to 50% of carrying capacity, see <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">DeVore & Lee (2013)</span></a> and <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Woodburn (1988)</span></a><br /><br /> <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Wyman (2009)</span></a> in a brilliant set of lectures on hunter gatherers, makes the following points: If you look where hunter-gatherers live now, each small group of about 40 people  are spread out over a very large area and they use that area to hunt in and to collect fruits and nuts, and whatever they can get from the trees. It looks like a very simple question, why is the density of hunter-gatherers so low? Why are there so few of them?<br /><br />For a long time, the answer was: they didn’t have much food. That they needed all this space to get enough food to survive, and if they overpopulated that space they couldn’t survive. In sort of modern hubris, we looked back and thought hunter-gatherer is a very inefficient form of food gathering, not modern, and we’re so much better than them now.<br /><br />(<i>&#8239;Professor Wyman goes on to say that hunter-gathering is a very efficient way of gaining a comfortable life, eating very well from a very wide range of nutritious foods, both animal and vegetable, and working only a few hours each day - but you do need large areas of land to make the lifestyle work, and this means only about two million people on earth&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />The data is quite clear on some part of those assumptions; hunter-gatherers, at the time when all human beings were in the stage of hunter-gatherers, before farming started about 10&nbsp;000 years ago.  At that time here may have been like two million people on the whole earth.  Hunter-gatherers spread out of Africa, spread amazingly over the whole earth, and maybe the total population of humans at that time was something like two million people. Now we have over six billion people, that’s an increase of 3&nbsp;000 times in the human population, so clearly there were fewer hunter-gatherers than people now.<br /><br />This is a very elementary kind of consideration. It talks about the long scale of human demography, of human population growth, and we came out of being other species of primate, of hominids and we gradually grew up to some sort of a limit. There’s the idea that the various productive systems that we use, like the hunter gathering limit is some sort of a carrying capacity limit, and so the idea is that the human population increased until it reached a limit and then for a very long period of time it can’t get beyond that limit.<br /><br />Then 10&nbsp;000 years ago, maybe it’s 12&nbsp;000, farming is invented and all of a sudden the whole system changes, there’s many more people and we jump up and then again reach a limit, and we’ll talk about that as some Malthusian limit in this particular period, later we’ll discuss that, and then around here the industrial revolution happens and all of a sudden the population increases again.<br /><br />This is a logarithmic scale so it’s not linear. Each of these jumps is by a factor of several thousand. That’s a very, very schematized version of human demographic history and we’re talking about this period. What limited hunter-gatherers to this level whereas farmers could go up to this level. Again, the obvious answer and looking at this kind of rough data is that it was food.<br /><br />Whoever then–archeologists, paleontologists go and actually try to examine this and there turns out to be the data does not fit that theory terribly well. What do archeologists do? They dig up skeletons and they have a good representative set of skeletons from the last 7,000 years in North and South America. One study looked at more than 12,500 skeletons so we’re talking about a good scientific sample. What did they find out? These were set into communities, and communities lasted so much time, so you can date the whole archeological site to a certain period.&<br /><br />The medical anthropologists got into it and started looking at the bones and dentition and all this, and not only did they find the violence we talked about last time, but these people were also sick. They had diseases at different times. You could see bone problems and how well the bones grew and from the teeth how much calcium they had, and all this. What does it turn out, that contrary to the idea of progress that you’d think the later people were more healthy, in fact, it was earlier people in the–the earlier individuals that were healthier. As time goes on, the skeletons get less and less healthy, that they’re getting less food and less good food, and were more subject to diseases.<br /><br />It was quite a shocker when this status started coming out. The researchers attributed this decline in health in large part to the rise in agriculture. Two main factors they say, the rise of agriculture and the rise of urban living, and we’ll talk about the urban story in a moment. If you again go like we did last time from the archeology to the anthropology and look at current hunter-gatherers, it’s a little bit of a distorted study because nowadays almost all hunter-gatherers have been pushed out of the good lands that they used to live in, into very marginal lands.<br /><br />You know this from U.S. History in high school, how the European farmers pushed the very earlier farmers or hunter-gatherers of the American Indians, the Native Americans into Arizona, into desert, into the Badlands in the West, the dry Badlands and to the West of the U.S., farming peoples push hunter-gatherers into inhospitable land.<br /><br />There’s a story in the Smithsonian Magazine recently about Pygmies in Africa. I don’t know if you know a little bit about the history of African demography, which we’ll also cover, but the Bantus have expanded from south–the bulge of southwest Africa basically all around and have pushed other people’s out and the Pygmies are one of the groups that have been very severely discriminated against and really pushed into inhospitable places.<br /><br />Another example is the Bushmen of Africa who were pushed into the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa. Even in the desert these guys eat 85 different species of plants, and it’s almost inconceivable in their culture, for someone to die of starvation because plants will bloom some years and not bloom some years. They will get a fungus some year, or a virus, plants–any one species is not generally very reliable. When you have 85 different species to survive on you’re not going to go without food. There will always be some group of plants that are going to be available to you and so you’re not going to starve.<br /><br />Further, the anthropologists lived with these people and they start writing down what they’re doing at every point in time. Per hour invested, the Bushmen get more food then the early agriculturalists. Not modern agriculturalists who can drive a tractor and in an hour do a lot, but we’re comparing hunter-gatherers to the first stages of agriculture. The Kalahari–the Bushmen in Kalahari spent 12 to 19 hours a week collecting food and the rest of the time they used for a lot more sleep than current farmers, and a lot more leisure than farming people, so life is more generous to them.<br /><br />You have to think now, this is for people pushed into a desert, a very inhospitable place, and now if they–if you can imagine them living in a lush forest region where they originated, life must have been much, much easier so the amount of time exerted to get your basics of food and everything must have been much–a lot less. Not only do they have to work less and they get more food per hour, but the variety of foods is very good for you because you need different minerals, you need different other micronutrients, you need different vitamins, and as we are bombarded with in the popular press, a variety of foods is very good for you. You don’t want to eat just one kind of food, so they had a very diverse and healthy kind of diet.<br /><br /><big><b>Thus I do not believe that Venus figures were used to enhance fertility</b></big>. <br /><br /><br /><br />The idea was to <b>reduce</b> fertility to replacement levels only, so that the land available could support the existing population at its optimum level, but factoring in  the surety of  excess supply in case of poor seasons. <br /><br />The hunter gatherers of the Palaeolithic ranged far and wide, often travelling large distances during the year in order to harvest resources which were time and place dependent, such as the migration of reindeer and ibex between summer and winter pastures, or the movements of fish up the rivers, or the migrations of horses, bison and aurochs. <br /><br />Thus <b>each band or group  of bands had their own territories</b>. Humans are  territorial, like birds or lions or ants,  and all other animals. <br /><br />A wonderful book on this topic is by Robert Ardrey, <i>The Territorial Imperative</i>, 	 <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Ardrey (1966)</span></a>  <br /><br /> <p><a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/iceagehunters.html" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images40/reindeerhunterssmsm.jpg" alt = "reindeer hunting" width="511" height="300" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p>When hunting reindeer, the band cooperated closely. Their long, thin and flexible darts were launched from a spear thrower or atlatl, which was a lever which allowed the hunters to get a much greater range and force for their shafts. The darts were armed with both flint blades and with  barbed antler harpoons. <br /><br /> We think of harpoons (that is, barbed bone or antler spear points) as being used for fish and large sea animals such as seals and whales, but they were first developed for reindeer hunting, and only later adapted for use with fish and marine mammals. <br /><br />Photo and text:  Adapted from <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Caselli (1985)</span></a><br />Additional text: <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Bibby (1956)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br />  <br /><br /><h1>Which leaves us with the question - Why?</h1><br /><br />Often a great deal of time and effort was expended in making the Venus Figures, and they were often works of considerable artistic merit. Most must have had some very important purpose. <br /><br />The obvious purpose is that of the representation of gods and goddesses. The Löwenmensch is obviously a male deity, and most female venus figures are probably of female deities. <br /><br />I believe that most served some useful ritual or spiritual purpose - perhaps to  protect the group from injury or disease,  or to ensure successful hunts, or simply as a tribute to the deities that controlled the herds and the weather, and perhaps the rising of the sun, and the passage of the seasons.  <br /><br />If so, this would imply the existence of,  at the very least,  spirits or deities which could influence events. <br /><br /> Some of the Venus figures may well have been cult figures, and the subject of idolatry, the worship of an idol or cult image. They may have been asked for favours of all kinds.  <br /><br /> This is especially possible where a large amount of time, effort, and skill has been expended in the carving or making of the figure. Candidates for this role include the Löwenmensch, the  Venus of Willendorf, the Venus of Lespugue, the Venus of Dolni Vestonice, and the large limestone venus from Kostenki. <br /><br /> In the latter case, the limestone venus from Kostenki has been broken, which may be accidental or for good perceived reason. <br /><br />We can now have no knowledge of exactly how these sculptures, paintings, and engravings were used, but there are historical parallels, as below. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><!--There has been a long history of such iconoclasm.  -->Cycladic Idols, circa 3&nbsp;000&nbsp;BC,   developed from an interplay of naturalistic and abstract forms, and, like the Gönnersdorf culture sculptures, were made in large numbers. <br /><br />They reference stone age idols, but reduce their bulky physicality and use a number of stylised protocols. The canonical figure shows a standing naked woman with arms crossed under her breasts. These idols are subdivided into subtypes that co-existed during the golden age of Cycladic culture, due to certain design features.<br /><br /> <p><a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images37/img_5083groupofidols.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images37/img_5083groupofidolssm.jpg" alt = "Cyclades " width="700" height="590"  hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a></p><br clear ="all"><p><b> Classic Cycladic Idols</b><br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />On loan from Badisches Landesmuseum Karlsruhe<br />Source and text: Archäologische Staatssammlung München</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><br /><b>Ancient Egypt provides us with many examples of statues of gods, often placed within temples, and prayed to by the priests of the temple dedicated to that god, and, on occasion, by the Pharaoh.

It is carved into a piece of tuff, which is formed when volcanic ash settles on the landscape and is hot enough to weld together into a light, porous rock, often like pumice stone, which is tuff formed on the surface of the ocean.<br /><br />Photo:  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Bahn (1998)</span></a><br />Text: Various sources</p><br clear = "all"><br /> <br /><br /><br /><hr size="4"  noshade width="50%" /><br /><h1>Obese Venus Figures</h1><h2>These are the iconic type of Venus figure that most people think of when the topic of Venus figures comes up</h2><br /><br /><b>Many, though by no means all of the venus figures are obese</b>, such as the  <a href ="https://www.donsmaps.com/willendorf.html"> Venus of Willendorf</a> and the <a href ="https://www.donsmaps.com/hohlefelsvenus.html">Venus of  Hohle Fels</a>.<br /> <br />Obesity may have been a desirable trait because of the fat reserves to tide the bearer over times of famine.

This  image of the  original <a href ="https://www.donsmaps.com/willendorf.html"> Venus of Willendorf</a> is from that session. <br /><br />This venus, and the Löwenmensch, or Lion Man, share equal top billing for the most important venus figures. <br /><br />Opinion is divided about the pattern around the head.<br /><br />Some say it is braided hair, others say it is a woven (or crocheted!)hat pulled low over the face. There is evidence for woven textilesfrom that time. It could also be basketry. <br /><br />But all agree that it is deliberate, to hide the face. The question is, why?<br /><br />All sorts of theories have been put forward - that it is an anonymousfemale, or that it is the earth mother, whose face not only <b>cannot</b> be seen, but <b>must</b> not be seen.<br /><br />All conjecture, and your guess is as good as anyone else's.<!--  Perhaps the sculptor was no good at carving faces!--><br /><br />The thick circles at the top of the breasts of the Willendorf venusare vestigial arms. If you look at the figure closely, you can see thematchstick arms starting at the shoulders, and continuing down thebody and across the breasts. Look closer still, and you can seebangles or arm ornaments at the wrists. Even hands with fingers areindicated.<br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock, 2008<br />Source: Original in the Vienna Natural History Museum</p><br clear ="all"><p><a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images38/img_4873venushohlefels.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images38/img_4873venushohlefelssm.jpg" alt = "hohle fels venus" width="324" height="500" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p>The  <a href ="https://www.donsmaps.com/hohlefelsvenus.html">Venus of  Hohle Fels</a>, height 59.7 mm <br /><br />This is a most unusual venus. It carries the apparent wish not to show the face of the earth mother figure to its logical extreme, and the head and face have been replaced altogether with just a small loop of ivory for a cord. <br /><br />In addition, in marked contrast to other venus figures, it has not been polished or at least smoothed. Instead it has deep markings on the breasts, arms and abdomen that look like cicatrices, cuts in the skin that have been immediately rubbed with ash to make them stand out from the rest of the body. These are similar markings to the animal figures from the nearby cave of Vogelherd. <br /><br />The breasts of the figure have been greatly exaggerated, and jut out from the body in an unnatural manner. The shoulders are broad and strong. The abdomen is in keeping with the thick thighs, yet the buttocks are almost non-existent.  There are no hands or feet shown. <br /><br /><!--This must surely be the ugliest, most grotesque, and least artistic venus figure ever discovered. <br /><br />It slots easily into the obese venus figure genre. --><br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source: Original, Urgeschichtliches Museum Blaubeuren</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p>		 <a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images40/DSC04530lespuguefront.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images40/DSC04530lespuguefrontsm.jpg" alt = "DSC04530lespuguefrontsm" width="259" height="600" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a>      <a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images40/DSC04535lespugue.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images40/DSC04535lespuguesm.jpg" alt = "Lespugue Venus back" width="297" height="600" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a>   </p><br clear = "all"><p>	  	 	 The <a href ="https://www.donsmaps.com/lespuguevenus.html">Lespugue Venus</a>, Front and back view.  <br /><br />Photo:Don Hitchcock 2018<br />Source: Original, Paris, Musée de l'Homme  </p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /> <p>	 <a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images28/dolnivenusimg_1508.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images28/dolnivenusimg_1508sm.jpg" alt = "Dolni Vestonice Venus" width="201" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "15" vspace = "5"></a> <a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images28/dolnivenusimg_1495.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images28/dolnivenusimg_1495sm.jpg" alt = "Dolni Vestonice Venus" width="184" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "15" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p>Venus of Dolní Věstonice <br />Moravia, Czech Republic <br />Ceramic <br />31&nbsp;000 – 30&nbsp;000 cal.

It is at these sites that there were  venus sculptures of many types, as well as a multitude of engravings in the  Lalinde/Gönnersdorf style. <br /><br />At Lalinde, the only examples are of engravings. At Niaux, the only examples are paintings, and these are often inverted.  <br /><br />We have a series of well made  Venus figures in flint from Wilczyce, Poland. We have a series of well made sculptures in mammoth ivory from Mizyn.  <br /><br />Thus this Venus culture was exported essentially unchanged to Pekarna in the Czech Republic, to Wilczyce in Poland, and to Mizyn in Ukraine, from the  Lalinde/Gönnersdorf area of present day Germany.<br /><br />However only parts of the culture made their way to France, at  Lalinde (engravings) and  Niaux (paintings). Nevertheless this is an amazing concept to contemplate - that the culture could be spread over such a huge area during the Palaeolithic. <br /><br />This would seem to indicate that this set of venus figures were hugely important to the people of the Lalinde/Gönnersdorf  culture, and that the venus figures (expressed variously as sculptures, engravings and paintings) had great importance in their spiritual life. <br /><br />None of the other venus figures spawned such a huge geographic distribution, more than 3300 kilometres apart from one end of the range to the other if we measure from Niaux to Mizyn.  </big></b><br /><br /><br /><br /><hr size="4"  noshade width="50%" /><br /><h2>Clothed, slim Venus Figures</h2><br /><br />Apart from what may be described as a 'loin cloth' or possibly a short skirt on the Lespugue Venus, all the clothed venus figures found so far come from the  <a href ="https://www.donsmaps.com/malta.html">Mal'ta</a> site in Siberia. <br /><br /><p><a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images24/malta3front.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images24/malta3frontsm.jpg" alt = "Malta" width="111" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images31/ribbedvenus.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images31/ribbedvenussm.jpg" alt = "Malta" width="115" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images31/pockmarkedvenus.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images31/pockmarkedvenussm.jpg" alt = "Malta" width="153" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>  </p><br clear = "all"><p>(left) 	Figurine, Mal'ta, Height 42 mm, Width 8 mm<br /> <br /> (right) Figurine, Mal'ta.

These lines depicted more details of clothes that were not previously seen such as bracelets, hats, shoes, bags, and even back packs. The team also discovered that the creators of the figurines depicted different hats, hairstyles, and other accessories, and use different carving techniques to highlight the different materials such as fur and leather.<br /> <br /> Although the function of these figurines are still unknown, it is clear from the study that the Venus/Mother Goddess connotations attached to these figurines will have to be completely reevaluated. According to Dr. Lbova: 'What we can say for sure is that these realistic details of clothes, accessories, hairstyle clearly show that ancient masters made the figurines of some real people, maybe their relatives. I strongly doubt that these were the images of abstract goddesses or spirits in the sense often used to understand so-called Venus depictions.' <br /> <br /> Photo:  &copy; Vera Salnitskaya<br /> Source:  http://siberiantimes.com/<!-- http://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/features/f0213-world-famous-ancient-siberian-venus-figurines-are-not-venuses-after-all/ --><br /> Text: adapted from http://fuckyeaharchaeology.tumblr.com/post/139873235297/siberian-venus-figurines-are-not-venuses-after</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><hr size="4"  noshade width="50%" /><br /><h2> A lithe, naturalistic, well proportioned, and well muscled venus figure</h2><p>	<a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images33/img_4658lowen.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images33/img_4658lowensm.jpg" alt = "Lion Man" width="158" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><a href="https://www.donsmaps.com/images33/img_4657lowen.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="https://www.donsmaps.com/images33/img_4657lowensm.jpg" alt = "Lion Man" width="154" height="400" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p>The Lion Man of Ulm, Germany - the Löwenmensch. Aurignacian, in a level dated to between 40&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP&nbsp;-&nbsp;35&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP.<br /><br />This is one of the most important venus figures, and one of the oldest, along with the Venus of Hohle Fels, of similar age. Originally thought to be female, since it was patently a venus, it has since been found to be male. <br /><br />In about 2013, Wulf Hein and Kurt Wehrberger recreated this sculpture, using only palaeolithic tools available at the time of the creation of the original. <br /><br />The time required to create the original was possibly 400 hours, or seven weeks at eight hours a day with no days off. As all of this probably needed to be done in daylight rather than firelight to achieve the accuracy and detail in work that was often hard and monotonous, two months or more is perhaps a reasonable estimate of the time required.<br /><br /> This also suggests that, unless the sculpture was created slowly at odd moments over several months, someone as skilled as an artist may have been excused from other subsistence tasks to work specially on this piece. The experiment emphasises how valuable this sculpture must have been and, although little is known about its meaning or significance, it is clear that it was produced by a mind that could imagine and manufacture an artwork of symbolic importance.<br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015<br />Source:  Original,  Ulmer Museum, Germany<br />Text: adapted from  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Cook (2013)</span></a></p><br clear = "all"><br /><b>The fact that the <a href ="https://www.donsmaps.com/lionlady.html">Löwenmensch</a>, the Lion Man,  is a chimera, a 'hybrid' creature composed of the parts of more than one animal, in this case a lion and a human, is very significant.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 53 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/venusfigurespurpose.html responseCode 3 200

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Dublin Core Workshop Series is an ongoing effort to form an
international consensus on the semantics of a simple description record
for networked resources. It is expected that a simple and
widely-understood set of elements will promote interoperability amongst
heterogeneous metadata systems and improve resource discovery on the
Internet.</p>

<p> 
The present report describes the results of the fourth workshop in
this series (DC-4), held at the National Library of Australia in March,
1997. The 65 workshop participants included digital library
researchers, Internet networking specialists, content specialists, and
librarians from 12 countries on 4 continents.</p>


<h4>Previous Workshops in the Series</h4>

<p> The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set emerged as the primary
deliverable of the first workshop in this series 
<A HREF="http://purl.oclc.org/oclc/rsch/metadataI"> (The OCLC/NCSA
Metadata Workshop)</A>. The scope of this first workshop was limited
to identifying the semantics of a core set of descriptors that might
improve discovery for Web resources that could be thought of as
Document-Like-Objects.</p>

<p> Subsequent workshops have gradually extended the scope of the
Dublin Core effort. The 
<A HREF="http://purl.oclc.org/oclc/rsch/metadataII">second workshop</A>,
co-sponsored by the UK Office of Libraries and Networking (UKOLN) and OCLC, resulted in the Warwick Framework, a
conceptual model for a container architecture for metadata
<em>packages</em> of various types. The organizing principle that
emerged from this workshop was that there will be many packages of
metadata, independently developed and maintained for different purposes
by various communities, and that this modularization will allow for
coherent evolution of different components of the metadata landscape
under a single metadata architecture. </p>

<p>
The <A HREF="http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/image">CNI/OCLC Image
Metadata Workshop</A> focused on the use of the Dublin Core (DC)to
describe images. Consensus formed around the assertion that, with some
modifications of element names and definition, the Dublin Core would
serve quite adequately for description of a large class of image resources,
particularly those that share  characteristics with the document-like
objects that were the original focus of DC.</p>

<p> Extensive mailing list discussions following the third workshop
resulted in additions and modifications to the original 13-element
set. The result was a 
<A HREF="http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core">15-element Dublin
Core</A> with slightly modified element names. The consolidation of
this set can be thought of as marking the end of the element set
development phase of the Dublin Core and the beginning of a deployment
phase. While details of some of the elements remain to be elucidated,
there is sufficient agreement to move forward. The many
issues raised by the task of actually deploying Dublin Core helped to
define the agenda for the Canberra meeting.</p>


<h3>Goals and Objectives for DC-4 </h3>

The central issues for DC-4 were:

<UL>

<LI> <em>Element Structure</em><br> 
Formal identification of the structure of elements and possible
qualifiers is necessary for the specification of any given syntax. <p>

<LI> <em>Extensibility Issues</em><br>

From the beginning of the Dublin Core effort, it was recognized
that any core set would require mechanisms for extending the core set both
to other functional sets of metadata as well as to richer sets.
Without such mechanisms, each variety of metadata becomes a
monolith, requiring duplication of effort and resulting in
diversification of element sets rather than the convergence
necessary to support semantic interoperability.<p>

<LI> <em>Element Refinement</em><br>
Clearer definitions of the semantic content of certain of the
elements is necessary (for example, coverage, relation, and
rights management). 
</ul>

<h3>Results </h3>

<h4>Minimalists and Structuralists</h4>

<p>
Each of the Dublin Core workshops to date has taken on a particular
character reflecting some central emergent concern of the group. The
results of DC-4 are best understood as the manifestation of the tension
between two pragmatic camps: the <em>Minimalists</em> and the
<em>Structuralists.</em> </p>

<p> It is an oversimplification to suggest that these two groups are
distinct and mutually exclusive; in fact, they are two poles of a
continuum, and conferees were distributed throughout this continuum. </p>

<p> 
The Minimalist point of view reflects a strong commitment to the notion
that DC's primary motivating characteristic is its simplicity. This
simplicity is important both for creation of metadata (for example, by
authors unschooled in the cataloging arts) and for the use of metadata
by tools (for example, indexing harvesters, which will probably not make use of
detailed qualifiers or encoding schemes). The goal of semantic
interoperability across communities can only be achieved if there is a
simple core of elements that are understood to mean the same thing in
every case. Additional qualifiers support specifying, modifying, and
particularizing the meaning of an element.  Since this will probably be done
in different ways by different groups at different times, it will
potentially lead to semantic drift in the elements, and consequent loss
of semantic interoperability. </p>

<p> 
The Structuralists as a group accept the danger of this semantic drift in
exchange for the greater flexibility of a formal means of extending or
qualifying elements such that they can be made more useful for the
needs of a particular community. </p>

<h4> A Spectrum of Resource Description Richness</h4>

<p> Resolution of the tension between the Minimalist and Structuralist
positions will result only from experience in the real world of
resource discovery.  The real world is a messy place with
conflicting constraints. It may be helpful, however, to understand
these positions as points on a coherent continuum: </p>


<ul>
</li> <em>Full-Text Indexing</em> 

<p> Unstructured, inverted-file indexing of full-text resources;
this is the approach of most of the various harvesters such as
AltaVista and the like.</p>

</li> <em>Unfielded Surrogates</em>

<p> An undifferentiated collection of terms assigned to a resource
as metadata, either by authors, software agents, or human indexers.
No substructure tagging (so, one might be able to retrieve resources
containing the string "Tim Berners-Lee", for example, but would not
be able to distinguish resources <em>about</em> him from resources
created <em>by</em> him).</p>

</li><em> Minimally Fielded Surrogates</em>

<p> A limited number of fields with known semantics (Creator, Subject,
Title, for example). Identified element names (roles) support
fielded searching. This requires specified fields in a formally
managed name space (element set). This is the point on the continuum
closest to the Minimalist camp in the Dublin Core community. </p>


</li><em> Qualified Surrogates</em>
<p> Basic field names have additional attributes that support
refinement and qualification of the element names or their content.
This is the point on the continuum closest to the Structuralist camp in
the Dublin Core community.</p>

</li><em>Richly-Structured Surrogates</em>
<p>
Richly-elaborated structured data; a MARC record, for example, or a
fully developed Text-Encoding Initiative (TEI) record. </p>

</ul>

<p>
Each of these points on the resource description continuum represents
compromises among cost, ease of creation and maintenance, and utility.
At one end there is the virtue of simplicity: harvesting is done
with no concern for the domain, the structure, or the purpose. The
scale of the collection and delivery of the information is challenging,
but the description model is simplistic: word-level indexing. Search
result sets are generally very large; high recall, but typically very
low precision. Even with such coarse-grained retrieval, the results
can be useful.</p>
<p>
At the other extreme of the continuum, records are more costly to
construct and maintain, but hold the promise of higher precision, and
greater organizational coherence. The interpretation and use of such
records, either by humans or software agents, is also more complex and
requires more sophistication (training of humans, rich knowledge
representation schemas in software).</p>
<p>
The intended domain of Dublin Core description is between these
extremes, aimed at intermediate precision and high interoperability in
a record that should be relatively inexpensive to create and maintain.
The Dublin Core element set, having evolved as a consensus among many
stakeholders, should be an adequate foundation for this middle ground,
whether one takes a purely Minimalist approach or chooses a somewhat
more elaborate strategy of the Structuralists.</p>
<p>
Above all, it is the value of the elements that should be the primary
focus. Applying the continuum argument delineated above, this implies
that one might well be able to drop away all qualifiers (including,
perhaps, the element names themselves) and still have a surrogate for
the resource that is useful for retrieval. </p>

<p> The underlying assumption of those who would deploy qualifiers is
that the added structure and richness that they can provide can be used
to good effect to enhance discovery. Every decision to deploy
qualifiers should be measured against the question "Will this qualifier
improve discovery?" </p>

<p> The metadata community should take to heart the
physician's admonition: <em>above all, do no harm!</em> In this case,
doing no harm means keeping systems as simple and easily manageable as
can be accomplished while supporting the discovery tools appropriate to
a given domain. Qualifiers should be kept to a minimum. </p>


<h4>The Canberra Qualifiers</h4>

<p> Figure 1 illustrates the metadata model currently embraced in the
Dublin Core effort. It involves a metadata package (perhaps one of
many) comprised of some number of metadata elements. Each element has
subcomponents (either explicit or implied).</p>
<A NAME = "figure">
<p>
<center></A>
<img src = "meta.gif">
<p>
<h5>Current Dublin Core Model</h5>
</CENTER>
<p>
The data of central interest is the <em>Element Value </em> itself.
Indeed, an index of the undifferentiated collection of these
values would probably serve for many resource discovery purposes. </p>

<p> There are several ways by which such data can be qualified to make
it more useful. The most obvious is to identify the role of the
descriptive content. That is, the <em>element name</em> of the field in
which a particular descriptor best fits. Thus, <em>Weibel</em>,
<em>Iannella</em>, and <em>Cathro</em> have the role CREATOR in the
metadata of this report. The Dublin Core has 15 such roles or
<em>Element Names</em> as its basic fields. (See the reference page at 
<a href="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements">
http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements</a>).</p>

<p>
The DC-4 Workshop formalized additional qualifiers (the Canberra
Qualifiers) that had been discussed at other workshops and on the
mailing list, but had never been elaborated formally.</p>

<h5><em>LANGUAGE</em></h5>

<p> This qualifier specifies the language of the <em>element
value</em> of the descriptor field (not the resource itself).
This is increasingly important as issues of multilinguality come to
the fore on the Web. English has been the presumptive language of
the Web to date, but as this changes, it is important to be able to
identify both the language of the resource and the language of the
resource description.</p>

<h5><em>SCHEME </em></h5>

<p> This qualifier specifies a context for the interpretation of a
given element. Typically this will be a reference to an
externally-defined scheme or accepted standard. For example, a
SUBJECT field might be SCHEME-qualified as LCSH data (Library of
Congress Subject Heading).</p>

<p>
One way to think of a SCHEME qualifier is that it provides a
processing hint that may be used by an application or a person to
make better use of the element that is qualified. Thus, in the
previous example, one could ignore the SCHEME = LCSH and still have
a useful subject descriptor. </p>

<p>
There are other cases in which the SCHEME identifier would be
critical to the use of the field, however. For example, consider the case
where the SCHEME is DDC and the content of the SUBJECT field is a
Dewey Decimal System number: such a descriptor is useless outside
of the context of the DDC hierarchy.</p>

<p>
Similarly, a SCHEME identifier might be critical to the
interpretation of a date. Unambiguous parsing of a
date requires knowledge of the encoding standard (SCHEME) used in
the expression of the content (does the string <em>1997-10-07</em>
specify the tenth day of July or the seventh day of October?).</p> 

<p>Finally, SCHEME is particularly important to certain specific
communities that have well defined ontologies or thesauri that are
widely deployed for resource description. It is hard to imagine
effective resource description in the realm of medicine, for
example, without MESH (MEdical Subject Headings).
</p> 

<h5><em>TYPE (Sub-element Name)</em></h5
<p> This qualifier specifies a facet of a given field. The intent
of a TYPE qualifier is to narrow the semantics of a field. Another
way of looking at the TYPE qualifier is as a sub-element name; a
TYPE qualifier modifies the element name, not the content of the
element field.</p>

<p> The TYPE attribute is the most controversial of the Dublin Core
qualifiers. There is some logical difficulty in defining exactly
what the acceptable types are and how they should be defined. In a
sense, it is not a qualifier at all, but rather an hierarchical
subdivision of the element name itself.
</p>

<p> Indeed, the dot-encoding convention that was agreed upon in
Canberra reflects this. For example, a facet of a particular
element could be expressed thusly:

<PRE>
DC.creator.personalName = "John Smith"</PRE>

<p> This construct indicates that the string enclosed by quotes
represents the creator of a given resource, and further, that the
string in question represents a person's name (as opposed to a
corporate name, for example). This example satisfies the criterion
of a sub-element narrowing the semantics of the element which it
modifies; a Personal Name is just one variety of a name. It might
be useful to use it, but it does not violate the integrity of the
CREATOR field to ignore it. </p>

<p>
The unresolved problem with the application of sub-element names is
how to identify the authority for the sub-element name. The
existing convention for associating an element name with an
authority (see the HTML-META convention in the succeeding section)
does not specifically support hierarchical names. This will work
fine if one assumes that the authority for the element name and the
sub-element name are identical (the workshop agreed that a registry
of sub-element names for Dublin Core elements is desirable).
However, there will be many cases where one metadata authority will
want to adopt the broad categories of another, but add their own
sub-elements. Currently there is no recognized way to do this
unambiguously.</p>
<p>
Developments underway in Web Metadata Architecture (see subsequent discussion) 
will address this shortcoming.  For the time being,
HTML implementations attempting to deploy metadata built on complex
metadata models will have to rely on informal conventions among
early adopters to support the rich features they are developing in
their metadata systems. </p>

<h5>Associating Metadata Structures with Name Space Authority Agencies</h5> 

<p> Note that <A HREF = "#figure">Figure 1</a> includes an <em>authority</em> attribute
associated with the <em>Element Name</em> and <em>Scheme</em>
qualifiers. This is intended to demonstrate that these qualifiers may
be part of a controlled name space, and that the naming authority for
that name space may be optionally specified. In an online environment,
this would be accomplished via a hyperlink. For example, DC.TITLE is an
element name that is part of the Dublin Core metadata element set.
Dublin Core is the naming authority, and is managed by some group with
the responsibility to say what is in that name space. LCSH is the name
of a SCHEME, which is also a controlled name space, the authority for
which is the Library of Congress.</p>

<p> There may or may not be a machine-parseable link to the authority.
However, the SCHEME identifier LCSH may well be useful even if there is
no such link, because the identifier has public currency and
credibility. An application may well take advantage of that currency
without a link. Thus, links may be implicit or explicit. In
either case, there is no assurance that a given application can make
use of such a link. Such a mechanism can be exploited to the extent
that a community adopts a particular convention or scheme and deploys
it, and to the extent which applications are deployed to capitalize
on such conventions. </p>

<h4>Expression of Canberra Qualifiers in HTML 2.0</h4>

<p> It is important to maintain separation between the data content
standard and its syntactic expression, but it is also useful to examine
how the metadata model described above might be expressed in HTML
because of the strategic importance of early deployment of network
resource description on the Web. This has been from the start an
exercise in the fine art of technological finesse. </p>

<p>The May 1996 W3C Workshop on Distributed Indexing and Searching
resulted in a convention for the deployment of simple, unqualified
metadata. This convention specifies a simple way of expressing
metadata (while providing links to the reference implementation of the
metadata schema) that stays within the HTML 2.0 specification 
<A HREF="http://www.oclc.org:5046/~weibel/html-meta.html">(A proposed consensus for embedding metadata in HTML)</a>. Several prototyping efforts have applied this convention
and extended it to support  metadata with qualifiers.</p><p>
The addition of qualifiers complicates the syntactical issues. There
are two approaches to the specification of Canberra Qualifiers in
existing HTML (HTML 2.0), each with particular advantages and
disadvantages.</p>

<p>
The first method, the <em>Overloaded Content</em> approach, stays within the
HTML 2.0 syntax by embedding SCHEME and LANGUAGE information in the CONTENT
attribute of the META tag as illustrated in the following example:</p>

<PRE>
&LT;META 
NAME = "DC.subject" 
CONTENT = "(SCHEME=LCSH) (LANG=EN) Computer Cataloging of Network Resources"&gt;</PRE>

<p> This approach has the significant disadvantage of cluttering the
CONTENT field with qualifier information. Since the goal of embedded
metadata is in part to make the metadata more readily visible to
harvesters, the obfuscation of the CONTENT attribute is sub-optimal to
say the least. A smart harvester might parse the CONTENT attribute
intelligently and use (or ignore) the SCHEME and LANG identifiers
sensibly, but it is unreasonable to expect this to be the norm.</p>

<p>The second method, the <em>Additional Attribute</em> approach, involves a
cleaner representation of the data through the use of unofficial
additional attributes (SCHEME and LANG) in the META tag as illustrated below:</p>

<PRE>
&LT;META 
NAME = "DC.subject"
SCHEME = "LCSH"
LANG = "EN"
CONTENT = "Computer Cataloging of Network Resources"&gt;</PRE>

<p> The additional attributes should be ignored by most Web
software agents, causing no particular harm, but some parsers will not
validate HTML of this kind (an important consideration as formal
document repositories evolve) and the behavior of editing software is
undefined and potentially problematic. </p>

<p>
Early deployment of qualified Dublin Core metadata requires choosing
between these advantages and disadvantages. There are developments in
the world of Web architecture that should eliminate these problems. At
this writing, the details of the metadata architecture for the Web are
still indistinct, but it is possible to portray with broad brush
strokes some of the solutions on the horizon.</P>

<h4>The Co-Evolution of Web Metadata Architectures </h4>

<p> 
There is an increasing recognition of the need for a metadata
architecture for the Web. The goal of such an architecture is to
support the encoding and transport of many independently developed
varieties of metadata in a manner that maximizes system
interoperability. There are currently several initiatives underway
under the auspices of the W3C that are addressing these issues.
Current discussions among these working groups can be expected to
converge toward a single architecture that will include the ability to
accommodate Dublin Core style metadata. A brief description of these
initiatives follows.</p>

<h5><em> Cougar </em></h5>

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Cougar/"> 
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Cougar/</A><br>

<p>
Cougar is the code name for W3C work on the next version of HTML.
Cougar builds upon previous work on W3C's Recommendation for HTML 3.2.
Among the extensions currently under discussion are (1) rich forms and
interactive documents, (2) the ability for pages to be changed
dynamically via scripting, frames and subsidiary windows, (3) improved
access to HTML features for people with disabilities, (4) the addition
of multimedia object capabilities, and (5) internationalization of
HTML. Additional discussion is focusing on the need for enhancing the
META element to allow for additional descriptive information to be
embedded in the HTML resource. </p>

<h5><em>XML</em></h5>

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/"> 
http://www.w3.org/XML/</a><BR>


<p>
The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a data format for structured
document interchange on the Web. XML is intended to be a standard "to
make it easy and straightforward to use SGML on the Web: easy to define
document types, easy to author and manage SGML-defined documents, and
easy to transmit and share them across the Web." The goal of this
working group is to enable generic SGML to be served, received, and
processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML. The
extensible character of XML will also make the encoding of metadata
easier and more flexible.</p>

<h5><em> Web Collections </em></h5> 

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-XMLsubmit.html"> 
http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-XMLsubmit.html</a><BR>

<p>
Web Collections is an application of XML that is used to describe the
properties of some object. Web Collections uses XML to provide a
hierarchical structure for these data. Each collection specifies a
profile that allows applications to expect specific properties in that
collection. For example, a collection describing a Web page might specify
the "WebPage" profile which would allow a program to know that this
collection describes a web page and has properties such as, for
example, <em>author</em> and <em>date-last-modified</em>.</p>

<h5><em> WebDAV</em> </h5>

<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/"> 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/</a> 
<p>
WEBDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Version control) specifies a set
of methods and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management
of resource metadata, simple name space manipulation, simple resource
locking (collision avoidance) and resource version control.

<h5> <em>PICS-NG </em></h5>

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/PICS/NG"> 
http://www.w3.org/PICS/NG</a> 

<p>
PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection) is an infrastructure for
associating labels (metadata) with Internet resources. The initial goal
of this infrastructure, content filtering, is being expanded to address
broader issues of generalized resource description, including
organizational management, discovery and retrieval, intellectual
property rights, and privacy protection tasks. This W3C working group
will define a new format for labels in order to better address these
issues. The new format will permit non-numeric values (eg., string
values), structured values and element repeatability.</p>


<h4>Related Issues</h4>

<p>
Several <em>ad hoc</em> working groups formed around unresolved issues
that arose in the course of the workshop. Some of these activities
have led to working papers describing the ongoing work of these
groups. While the conclusions of these groups have not necessarily
been widely vetted, they represent an important aspect of the
evolutionary development of the Dublin Core.</p>
<uL>
<li><em>The Coverage Element </em>
<p> The COVERAGE element has had strong proponents from the very
first workshop. Advocates argue that this element is a potentially
indispensable tool for improving discovery for many types of data
(especially geo-spatial data). The difficulty with this element is
that providing guidelines for application is domain-dependent and
potentially complex.</p>

<p> The Coverage Element Working Group has brought forth a position
paper <a
href="http://alexandria.sdc.ucsb.edu/public-documents/metadata/dc_coverage.html">
(http://alexandria.sdc.ucsb.edu/public-documents/metadata/dc_coverage.html)</a>
suggesting how this element might be deployed in
the context of the hierarchical dot notation described in an earlier
section of this paper.
</p>

</p>
<li>Multilinguality </em>
<p> As mentioned earlier, issues of multilinguality are assuming
greater importance as the Web becomes more international in scope and
expression. The mix of technical, cultural, and political factors
that come into play in any solution to multilinguality problems are
daunting at best. A working group formed around the multilinguality
aspects of the metadata problem, and a position paper 
<a href="http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~tbaker/Cores.html"> 
(http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~tbaker/Cores.html)</a> is available describing
the some of the problems and possible approaches to solving these
problems.
</p>

<li>Metadata Registries </em>
<p>
Name space management is prominent among the thorny impediments of
deploying a world-wide metadata architecture. Who controls a given
metadata name space (such as the Dublin Core, for example)? How can
such a name space be partitioned such that it can be easily extended
by others without re-inventing a particular wheel? What conventions
are necessary to make a naming authority globally visible and
accessible, and what sort of structured or unstructured data should
be available online for humans or applications to process?
</p>

<p> Many of these questions arose during the Canberra Workshop,
along with the recognition that resolving them will require
coordination beyond the Dublin Core group. A subgroup of the
workshop began the large task of defining more clearly the
`approved' list of sub-element names. The draft position paper on
this work, still in progress, is accessible at 
<A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/marc/dcqualif.html">
http://www.loc.gov/marc/dcqualif.html </a>.</p>


<p> Several of the DC-4 conferees will participate in a workshop
that addresses just this topic, the Joint Workshop on Metadata
Registries 
<a href="http://www.lbl.gov/~olken/EPA/Workshop/index.html">
(http://www.lbl.gov/~olken/EPA/Workshop/index.html)</a>, sponsored
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and organized by staff
at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for July of 1997. </p>
</ul>

<h4> Future Deliverables</h4> 

<p> The broad agreements about syntax and semantics that emerged from
the workshop discussions and subsequent exchanges on the META2 mailing
list will be expressed in a series of four documents currently under
development. These documents will be formalized as IETF Requests for
Comment (RFCs) in an effort to seed the standardization process for
Dublin Core metadata. These RFCs will comprise the following
documents:</p>

<UL>
<LI> <em>Dublin Core Metadata for Simple Resource Description </em><br> 

A description of the intended semantics of the 15-element Dublin
Core set 

<LI> <em>Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML </em><br>

A formal description of the convention for embedding unqualified
Dublin Core metadata in HTML 

<LI> <em> Qualified Dublin Core Metadata for Simple Resource Description</em><BR>

Recommended semantics for Dublin Core Metadata with Canberra Qualifiers

<LI> <em>Encoding Qualified Dublin Core Metadata in HTML</em> <BR>

Recommended syntax for encoding Dublin Core metadata
with qualifiers in HTML
</UL> 

<h3>Summary and Future Developments</h3>

<p> The Canberra Workshop resulted in progress on the metadata model
that underlies the Dublin Core and clarified the qualifiers necessary
to implement this model. Further, conferees emerged with a logical
outline of the implementation details that need to be clarified to
support wider deployment; these details will be the subjects of the
RFCs outlined in the preceding section.</p>

<p> It has become clear in the intervening months that some of these
details will be difficult to resolve, requiring consensus not only
among those directly involved with the Dublin Core effort, but also
many other groups involved in Web standards and other metadata
initiatives.</p>

<p> Nonetheless, the continued, incremental progress towards a common
goal encourages further effort, and planning for a 5th workshop is
underway. DC-5 is tentatively planned for October 6-8 in Helsinki,
Finland. The focus of this meeting will be to promote convergence
among the early implementers, and to reconcile issues of syntax with
the rapidly emerging metadata infrastructure of the Web. </p>

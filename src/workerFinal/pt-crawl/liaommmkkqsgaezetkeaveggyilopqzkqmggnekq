content area --><div class="wrapper" id="main"><section id="content">When an ordinary man comes before an African king, he would normally salute him with these words: &quot;May the king live forever!&quot;<br><br>But once lived a man who refused to say this obligatory phrase, instead substituting: &quot;There is no king like God.&quot; <br><br>After many visits to the king, and many repetitions of this heretical phrase, the king grew angry and plotted to destroy the man.<br><br>He gave the man two silver rings and told him they were a present to keep, but in reality the king meant to avenge himself through them. <br><br>The man, whom everybody by now call &quot;No-King-as-God&quot;, took the rings, put them into a dried empty ram&#39;s horn, and gave them to his wife to keep for him. <br><br>A week later the king called No-King-as-God and sent him to a distant village, to tell the people to come and help build up the city walls.<br><br>As soon as he had gone, the king sent for the man&#39;s wife and offered her a thousand cowries (imported small shells used as money or ornaments), and a hundred head-cloths and body-cloths, if she would give him that which her husband had entrusted to her. <br><br>Tempted by the splendid presents, the wife agreed and brought the ram&#39;s horn, and when the king looked inside, there were the two rings safely stored.<br><br>He placed them back in the horn, and gave it to his servants with instructions to throw it far into a lake. They did so, and as the horn fell into the water a great fish swam by and swallowed it. <br><br>On the day that No-King-as-God was returning home, he met his son and some friends near his home, and they wanted to go fishing. He went with them and caught that great fish.<br><br>As his son was cleaning the big fish, his knife struck something hard and he called to his father. <br><br>The father pulled out the horn, and when he opened it and looked inside he saw the rings which the king had given him for safe keeping. <br><br>&quot;Truly,&quot; he said, &quot;there is no king like God.&quot;<br><br>They were still fishing, when a royal messenger came and told the man he was wanted by the king at once. <br><br>He stopped at his house first and asked his wife where was that precious thing he had entrusted to her. She replied that she could not find it, and thought a rat had eaten it.<br><br>Shaking his head at her lies, the man set off for the royal court. <br><br>The other counsellors all saluted the king, by saying, &quot;May the king live forever.&quot; But the man said only, &quot;There is no king like God.&quot;<br><br>So the king told the counsellors to be quiet, and advancing towards the man he said, &quot;Is it true that there is no king like God?&quot; The man replied firmly, &quot;Yes&quot; <br><br>Then the king demanded the rings which he had entrusted to the man, and signalled his guards to get ready to kill him.<br><br>But No-King-as-God put his hand under his robe and pulled out the horn and handed it to the king. <br><br>The king opened it and took out his two silver rings. &quot;Indeed, there is no king like God!&quot;, he said total amazement, and all his counsellors shouted in approval. <br><br>Then the king divided his city into two, and gave half of it to No-King-as-God to rule.<p></section><aside><h3>Encyclopaedia</h3><nav id="secondary-navigation"><ul><li><a href="https://www.gateway-africa.com/fuanaflora/">Fauna and Flora</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gateway-africa.com/tribe/">Tribes of Africa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gateway-africa.com/countries/">African Countries</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gateway-africa.com/namibia/">Safari Travel</a></li></ul></nav></aside></div><!-- footer area --><footer><div id="colophon" class="wrapper clearfix" style="text-align: center"><a href="../credits.html">©<span xmlns:dct="https://purl.org/dc/terms/" property="dct:title"> www.gateway-africa.com</span> - 1987 - <span xmlns:cc="https://creativecommons.org/ns#" property="cc:attributionName">Christian Fourie / Chrigi-in-Africa</span></a> </div></footer><!-- jQuery --><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>

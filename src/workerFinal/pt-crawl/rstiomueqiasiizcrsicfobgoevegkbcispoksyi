        a century in the shadows, Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) has recently 
        become the subject of increasing attention. It is suggested here, expanding 
        on observations made by anthropologist Gregory Bateson some years ago, 
        that Wallace's cybernetics-like view of the operation of natural selection--as 
        a governor-like principle tending to keep species unvarying--can be expanded 
        to a more complete evolutionary understanding by exploring in modern context 
        Wallace's idea that "more recondite forces" are driving the process. Specifically, 
        when the environment is regarded as a final cause (but not a deterministic 
        force), individual adaptations may be viewed as entropy-relaying structures 
        (acting in response to, and as a part of, larger scale biogeochemical 
        agenda), whereas negentropy is accumulated by nonrandomly directed organism- 
        and population-level forms of ecological engagement. Thus, range change 
        in particular is viewed as a process that is both driven and nonrandom, 
        and ultimately connected to the derivation of more and more organized 
        individual, population, and community structures. Keywords: Alfred Russel 
        Wallace, natural selection, cybernetics, negative feedback, positive feedback, 
        evolution, biogeography, ecological modelling, history of biology</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1858 a then little-known bird and 
        insect collector named Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) was struck with 
        a startling revelation while fending off an attack of malaria in the Moluccas. 
        As soon as the fit passed he prepared an essay on the idea--natural selection--and 
        sent it off to a man he figured would be interested in the concept: Charles 
        Darwin. The rest of the story is well enough known not to bear repeating; 
        in the end it was Darwin whose name became most associated with the principle, 
        with Wallace relegated to "other man" status, and his ideas to the dustbin 
        of history.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether all this was fair or even represented 
        some kind of conspiracy against Wallace has been debated for many years,<SUP><a href="#1">1</a></SUP> 
        but most observers seem to feel that, all told, things worked their way 
        out pretty well. Certainly, natural selection was revealed to the world 
        at the earliest possible juncture, and even Wallace benefitted to the 
        extent that he was immediately welcomed into the highest echelons of scientific 
        discourse, along the way becoming one of the most famous men of his time.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in truth the premature reading of Wallace's 
        brainchild may also have had some negative effects on the longer term 
        development of evolutionary theory. The more one reads and digests the 
        full body of Wallace's work, the more one realizes that Wallacian natural 
        selection is quite a distinct animal from Darwinian natural selection, 
        and that the two men's views on evolution overall were more different 
        yet. And, whereas every word of Darwin's writings has been run through 
        the philosophical grist mill and thoroughly digested, much of what Wallace 
        wrote has yet to receive its rightful full appraisal.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a fair amount has been published on 
        Wallace and his ideas over the years, a sharp increase in interest has 
        been evident of late.<SUP><a href="#2">2</a></SUP> While there are likely many reasons 
        for this, surely one of the most important has been the re-examination 
        of hundreds of what might be termed "lost" writings of his. Many of these 
        have revealed clues as to what he actually had in mind both in the years 
        preceding the "Ternate essay" on natural selection, and those following 
        it. I have discussed this subject in considerable detail elsewhere;<SUP><a href="#3">3</a></SUP> 
        here, this new interpretation of Wallace's intellectual evolution is summarized 
        with the ultimate object of illuminating a possible new direction in evolutionary 
        and biogeographic studies it suggests.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the considerable impact on Wallace of 
        Charles Lyell's <EM>Principles of Geology</EM> and Robert Chambers's <EM>Vestiges 
        of the Natural History of Creation</EM> in 1844 or 1845 has been noted 
        by just about everyone who has written on him, it is less well known that 
        at that point he had already been entertaining evolutionary views of a 
        non-biological nature for several years. In early 1837, when just fourteen 
        years old, he fell in with a group of Owenite socialist utopians, and 
        was profoundly influenced by their views on how to bring about progressive 
        social reform. Wallace was especially taken with their ideas on social 
        justice, and in turn with the relation between belief and just cause and, 
        ultimately, the intrinsic advantages of absorbing and applying varied 
        forms of knowledge. Apart from Wallace's own recollections on these matters 
        in his autobiography <EM>My Life</EM>,<SUP><a href="#4">4</a></SUP> we know of these influences 
        because three of his earliest writings, from the period 1841-1843,<SUP><a href="#5">5</a></SUP> 
        have survived. Two of these even extend the "varied knowledge" notion 
        to a prescription for success for the evolution of whole societies.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centrality in Wallace's thinking of his views 
        on belief, in particular, and how this is related to social and natural 
        change, cannot be overemphasized. The following passage, from an 1861 
        letter sent to his brother-in-law Thomas Sims while Wallace was still 
        in the Malay Archipelago, is lengthy, but tells the whole story:</P>
<blockquote>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1">. . . You intimate that the happiness to be enjoyed 
          in a future state will depend upon, and be a reward for, our belief 
          in certain doctrines which you believe to constitute the essence of 
          true religion. You must think, therefore, that belief is <EM>voluntary</EM> 
          and also that it is <EM>meritorious</EM>. But I think that a little 
          consideration will show you that belief is quite independent of our 
          will, and our common expressions show it. We say, 'I wish I could believe 
          him innocent, but the evidence is too clear'; or, 'Whatever people may 
          say, I can never believe he can do such a mean action.' Now, suppose 
          in any similar case the evidence on both sides leads you to a certain 
          belief or disbelief, and then a reward is offered you for changing your 
          opinion. Can you really change your opinion and belief, for the hope 
          of reward or the fear of punishment? Will you not say, 'As the matter 
          stands I can't change my belief. You must give me proofs that I am wrong 
          or show that the evidence I have heard is false, and then I may change 
          my belief'? It may be that you do get more and do change your belief. 
          But this change is not voluntary on your part. It depends upon the force 
          of evidence upon your individual mind, and the evidence remaining the 
          same and your mental faculties remaining unimpaired--you cannot believe 
          otherwise any more than you can fly.</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="-1">Belief, then is not voluntary. 
        How, then, can it be meritorious? When a jury try a case, all hear the 
        same evidence, but nine say 'Guilty' and three 'Not guilty,' according 
        to the honest belief of each. Are either of these more worthy of reward 
        on that account than the others? Certainly you will say No! But suppose 
        beforehand they all know or suspect that those who say 'Not guilty' will 
        be punished and the rest rewarded: what is likely to be the result? Why, 
        perhaps six will say 'Guilty' honestly believing it, and glad they can 
        with a clear conscience escape punishment; three will say 'Not guilty' 
        boldly, and rather bear the punishment than be false or dishonest; the 
        other three, fearful of being convinced against their will, will carefully 
        stop their ears while the witnesses for the defence are being examined, 
        and delude themselves with the idea they give an honest verdict because 
        they have heard only one side of the evidence. If any out of the dozen 
        deserve punishment, you will surely agree with me it is these. Belief 
        or disbelief is therefore not meritorious, and when founded on an unfair 
        balance of evidence is blameable.</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="-1">Now to apply the principles to my own 
        case. In my early youth I heard, as ninety-nine-hundredths of the world 
        do, only the evidence on one side, and became impressed with a veneration 
        for religion which has left some traces even to this day. I have since 
        heard and read much on both sides, and pondered much upon the matter in 
        all its bearings. I spent, as you know, a year and a half in a clergyman's 
        family and heard almost every Tuesday the very best, most earnest and 
        most impressive preacher it has ever been my fortune to meet with, but 
        it produced no effect whatever on my mind. I have since wandered among 
        men of many races and many religions. I have studied man and nature in 
        all its aspects, and I have sought after truth. In my solitude I have 
        pondered much on the incomprehensible subjects of space, eternity, life 
        and death. I think I have fairly heard and fairly weighed the evidence 
        on both sides, and I remain an <EM>utter disbeliever</EM> in almost all 
        that you consider the most sacred truths. I will pass over as utterly 
        contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics shut out evidence 
        because they will not be governed by the morality of Christianity. You 
        I know will not believe that in my case, and <EM>I</EM> know its falsehood 
        as a general rule. I only ask, Do you think I can change the self-formed 
        convictions of twenty-five years, and could you think such a change would 
        have anything in it to merit <EM>reward</EM> from <EM>justice</EM>? I 
        am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of 
        mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God 
        and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or 
        whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to 
        suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that 
        those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief 
        of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a 
        matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.<SUP><a href="#6">6</a></SUP></FONT></P>
</blockquote>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can only conclude from this entirely transparent 
        argument that Wallace felt a belief in false things--and possibly even 
        unreal things--was unproductive; that is to say, "personally nonadaptive." 
        And yet false beliefs both existed, and could be overcome: the pattern 
        of human history seemed to prove as much. What, in turn, did he suppose 
        the pattern of biological change might prove?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reading Chambers about 1845, Wallace very 
        quickly figured out how to demonstrate that evolution did in fact take 
        place: through the study of the traces of the speciation process left 
        in the fossil record and in current distribution patterns. He was not 
        so quick, however, to recognize how individual adaptations fit into the 
        overall picture. The problem, possibly beginning as early as this 1845 
        period, was his initial position on utility as it related to adaptation. 
        At this time it would appear that, contrary to Wallace's well-known post-1858 
        position, he believed many adaptations served no necessary utilitarian 
        purpose. There are remarks to that effect in his 1853 book <EM>Narrative 
        of Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro</EM>,<SUP><a href="#7">7</a></SUP> and this position 
        is even more plainly stated in the little known work "On the Habits of 
        the Orang-utan of Borneo," published in 1856:</P>
<blockquote>
        <P>. . . <FONT SIZE="-1">Do you mean to assert, then, some of my readers 
          will indignantly ask, that this animal, or any animal, is provided with 
          organs which are of no use to it? Yes, we reply, we do mean to assert 
          that many animals are provided with organs and appendages which serve 
          no material or physical purpose. The extraordinary excrescences of many 
          insects, the fantastic and many-coloured plumes which adorn certain 
          birds, the excessively developed horns in some of the antelopes, the 
          colours and infinitely modified forms of many flower-petals, are all 
          cases, for an explanation of which we must look to some general principle 
          far more recondite than a simple relation to the necessities of the 
          individual. We conceive it to be a most erroneous, a most contracted 
          view of the organic world, to believe that every part of an animal or 
          of a plant exists solely for some material and physical use to the individual,--to 
          believe that all the beauty, all the infinite combinations and changes 
          of form and structure should have the sole purpose and end of enabling 
          each animal to support its existence,--to believe, in fact, that we 
          know the one sole end and purpose of every modification that exists 
          in organic beings, and to refuse to recognize the possibility of there 
          being any other. Naturalists are too apt to <EM>imagine</EM>, when they 
          cannot <EM>discover</EM>, a use for everything in nature...<SUP><a href="#8">8</a></SUP></FONT></P>
</blockquote>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace probably arrived at this anti-utilitarian 
        position on the basis of two main considerations. First, and as suggested 
        earlier, he had undoubtedly observed that many human beliefs and behaviors 
        existed that were anything but progressively utilitarian. Yet these nevertheless 
        existed, had come into being somehow, and even once operating did not 
        always prevent society from moving forward. In like fashion, one could 
        imagine a biological process in which adaptations emerged not as the feature 
        innovations of evolutionary advance, but instead in some manner making 
        them a by-product of, or perhaps even just "correlated" with, it. Second, 
        and following Chambers's idea that it made better sense to envision an 
        evolutionary process operating on the basis of natural law than unknowable 
        forces, Wallace was rejecting the notion that each individual adaptation 
        served a prior purpose in the overall scheme of things--that is, arose 
        as a first cause. In the passage from "On the Habits..." quoted above, 
        his concern in this regard is obvious in the three concluding sentences.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange as it may sound, it is thus not likely 
        that Wallace's significant concerns during the pre-1858 period included 
        identifying adaptive structures that were . . . adaptive. This did not 
        stop him from believing that there was an evolutionary "progression," 
        however, and he was also making it his business to identify its final 
        cause. Despite the existence of what appeared to be nonadaptive behaviors 
        and structures, there had to be "some general principle far more recondite" 
        (as he describes it in the quote given above) that was driving evolutionary 
        change--some force or set of forces, perhaps climatological or geophysical 
        in nature, that subtly overrode the clutter of detail apparent at the 
        adaptational level, inexorably acting to propel change at a slow, grandiose 
        scale. Perhaps if while in the field he examined enough particulars of 
        form and function, he might be able to figure out what this final cause 
        was. Note, however, that at no time before 1858 did he imagine that he 
        would ever be able to understand how or why all adaptational structures 
        <EM>individually</EM> came into being: looking back at this matter in 
        his 1905 autobiography <EM>My Life</EM>, he wrote: "My paper written at 
        Sarawak rendered it certain in my mind that the change had taken place 
        by natural succession and descent--one species becoming changed either 
        slowly or rapidly into another. But the exact process of the change and 
        the causes which led to it were absolutely unknown and appeared almost 
        unconceivable."<SUP><a href="#9">9</a></SUP></P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Sarawak" paper he speaks of, "On the Law 
        Which Has Regulated the Introduction of New Species," was published in 
        1855.<SUP><a href="#10">10</a></SUP> It signalled, as he says above, his final recognition 
        of evolutionary descent as a biological reality. But the "Every species 
        has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing 
        closely allied species" model it famously embraced only described the 
        <EM>results</EM> of the process, not its <EM>causes</EM>. Indeed, he was 
        actually no closer to an understanding of either the final or immediate 
        causes of evolution than he had been ten years earlier (as evidenced by 
        the orangutan paper, written and published about a year later). All of 
        this changed in early 1858, and the famous bout with malaria during which 
        he thought out the principle of natural selection.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider, now, how the survival of the fittest 
        concept most likely would have struck Wallace at this point. Contrary 
        to the way it has commonly been portrayed, it was not at all the "logical 
        conclusion" of Wallace's earlier attempts at dealing with evolution. Indeed, 
        one might reasonably argue that it was their absolute antithesis, and, 
        accordingly, "On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from 
        the Original Type"<SUP><a href="#11">11</a></SUP> not only does not refer, even obliquely, 
        to the Sarawak paper or law, it doesn't refer to any of the several following 
        writings Wallace published that applied that model.<SUP><a href="#12">12</a></SUP> For Wallace, 
        the central revelation of early 1858 was his ability now to envision a 
        single, generalizable process through which any adaptation could continually 
        be selected for or against. He would have to give up the idea that some 
        adaptations had no utility (unless they were somehow integrally connected 
        with ones that did), however. This was not such a problem biologically 
        (he actually had no way to prove whether any given adaptation was utilitarian, 
        anyway), but he felt unable to budge on the matter of human thoughts and 
        beliefs, which yet seemed to afford too many instances both of "nonprogressive 
        belief," and higher attributes such as mathematical abilities that had 
        come into existence before useful applications could be found for them. 
        In consequence, the paper he sent to Darwin makes no mention of humankind: 
        and not because he didn't wish to point to the situation with humans as 
        being an exception, but for the very reason that he <EM>did</EM>.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to 1858 it had thus been Wallace's peculiar 
        perspective that evolution was in a general sense progressively adaptive, 
        but that some of the individual adaptive structures produced through it 
        were not. Now, through natural selection, he could believe that <EM>all</EM> 
        strictly biological adaptations were in an ecological sense adaptive, 
        but not necessarily evolutionarily adaptive: i.e., a species' adaptive 
        suite might serve to support it in the environment of one era, but then 
        fail it in the next, leading to extinction. Was this a helpful elaboration? 
        Wallace apparently thought so, despite the fact that it neither shed any 
        light on why some human attributes yet seemed to be non-adaptive, nor 
        helped him to understand what the final cause of evolution was--or for 
        that matter, whether it was still even necessary to think in terms of 
        final causes. He would test the waters on this new idea by circulating 
        the draft of an essay on what seemed to be the one element of the question 
        that was tightly defendable, the "special case" of natural selection as 
        it applied to non-human species.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before Wallace knew it, the paper, which 
        included thoughts rather closely resembling some of those held by the 
        man he had sent it to for possible forwarding to Charles Lyell, was read 
        publicly and set to print. He was informed only after the fact. He was 
        now viewed by--everyone--as "Darwinian," despite the fact that his ideas 
        actually extended to well beyond what that tag represented.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Wallace would extricate himself from this 
        situation is a subject I have taken up elsewhere;<SUP><a href="#13">13</a></SUP> for the 
        present let us shift the discussion away from history and toward today's 
        science. We can begin by suggesting that the attention that has been lavished 
        on debating whether Darwin might have committed intellectual theft from 
        Wallace should be refocussed on a matter of substantially greater interest: 
        whether nearly one hundred fifty years of largely ignoring Wallace's world 
        view has been in our best interest.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In claiming that Wallacism has a right to be 
        considered on its own terms, and as more than just a historical satellite 
        to Darwinism, we may look in the first instance for elements of Wallace's 
        framework that might have significant relevance to today's efforts to 
        model large-scale evolutionary processes. One such element harkens back 
        to Wallace's law-like model of natural selection, which distinguishes 
        between ecological and evolutionary outcomes in a manner contrasting in 
        certain important respects with Darwin's solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most intriguing passages in Wallace's 
        Ternate essay likens the action of natural selection to a governor on 
        a steam engine:</P>
<blockquote>
        <P>. . . <FONT SIZE="-1">The action of this principle is exactly like 
          that of the centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and 
          corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in 
          like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever 
          reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at 
          the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction 
          almost sure soon to follow.<SUP><a href="#14">14</a></SUP></FONT></P>
</blockquote>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 1972 work <EM>Steps to an Ecology of the 
        Mind</EM>, anthropologist Gregory Bateson made some interesting comments 
        on this passage:</P>
<blockquote>
        <P>. . . <FONT SIZE="-1">The steam engine with a governor is simply a 
          circular train of causal events, with somewhere a link in that chain 
          such that the more of something, the less of the next thing in the circuit 
          . . . If causal chains with that general characteristic are provided 
          with energy, the result will be . . . a self-corrective system. Wallace, 
          in fact, proposed the first cybernetic model . . . Basically these systems 
          are always <EM>conservative</EM> . . . in such systems changes occur 
          to conserve the truth of some descriptive statement, some component 
          of the <EM>status quo</EM>. Wallace saw the matter correctly, and natural 
          selection acts primarily to keep the species unvarying . . .<SUP><a href="#15">15</a></SUP></FONT></P>
</blockquote>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, in the 1979 collection <EM>Mind and Nature: 
        A Necessary Unity</EM>, Bateson added the following observations:</P>
<blockquote>
        <P>. . . <FONT SIZE="-1">If it had been Wallace instead of Darwin [who 
          started the trend], we would have had a very different theory of evolution 
          today. The whole cybernetic movement might have occurred one hundred 
          years earlier as a result of Wallace's comparison between the steam 
          engine with a governor and the process of natural selection . . .<SUP><a href="#16">16</a></SUP></FONT></P>
</blockquote>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bateson's point is a most remarkable one, but 
        he and the others who have studied cybernetic relations in connection 
        with evolution have never looked in any detail into how the 1858 Ternate 
        model actually fit into Wallace's overall cosmology at that point. Without 
        doing so, we can proceed no further in this direction: cybernetic theory 
        notwithstanding, it is clear that no model of the greater evolutionary 
        program can invoke a causal explanation resting <EM>entirely</EM> on negative 
        feedback processes, as it is ultimately the breaking away from such recursive 
        constraints that by definition leads to novel development. Actually, Bateson 
        might have done more with his observation even at that point had he wished, 
        as in 1963 the evolutionary relationship between negative and positive 
        feedback couplings had already been explored in an important and influential 
        systems paper by Magoroh Maruyama entitled "The Second Cybernetics: Deviation-Amplifying 
        Mutual Causal Processes."<SUP><a href="#17">17</a></SUP> In this work Maruyama describes 
        how information imported from the environment represents feedbacks of 
        two kinds: deviation-countering processes (negative feedbacks) which tend 
        to enforce equilibrium conditions, and deviation-amplifying processes 
        (positive feedbacks), which cause systems to change, either in a direction 
        of greater or lesser order. While this position is helpful to understanding 
        how a living system might simultaneously be equilibrium conserving and 
        equilibrium superseding, it does not specify the conditions under which 
        directions "of greater or lesser order" might be obtained; i.e., what 
        is it in the longer term evolutionary sense that tips the scales in favor 
        of greater order?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In writings published in the 1980s<SUP><a href="#18">18</a></SUP> 
        I argued that Wallacian natural selection was better suited to thinking 
        in such systems terms than Darwin's model. Bateson had already pointed 
        out (as indicated in the passages produced above) that natural selection 
        might be considered a <EM>conservative</EM> process; that is, that it 
        does no more than produce the net result of a return toward equilibrium 
        for a system pushed toward disorder. All that was left to do was to identify 
        the components of the complementary deviation-amplifying function. I posited 
        that the overall thrust of organic evolution might be conceptually and 
        practically studied by: (1) agreeing with Bateson and Maruyama, and regarding 
        adaptive structures as operationalizing a process of negative feedback 
        in which energy sources at the surface of the earth are temporarily diverted 
        and captured, then applied to do chemical and physical work, then finally 
        returned in degraded form to the physical environment envelope (and ultimately 
        into space), maximizing system entropy, (2) treating the adaptive structures 
        themselves as in the main a <EM>potential</EM> for effecting system change, 
        and (3) most importantly, regarding that potential as enacted through 
        the entry into new ecological associations through organismal/population 
        behavior, movement, and dispersal (i.e., as the positive feedback/deviation-amplifying 
        part of the process capable of leading to net negentropy accumulation). 
        Ultimately, evolution-serving deviation amplification is achieved by the 
        tendency of individuals and populations to disperse through and interact 
        with their environment <EM>nonrandomly, in preferred spatial directions</EM>: 
        specifically, in those directions in which the relevant life support resources 
        are being made available--occurring, and turning over--at more optimum 
        rates.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that adaptive structures are in the 
        first instance negative feedback-relaying nodes is hardly a revolutionary 
        one, as this function is necessitated by their role as mediators in the 
        biogeochemical cycling of matter and energy, and the operation of the 
        Third Law. In turning to his "governor" understanding initially Wallace 
        was of course not thinking in such elaborate terms; instead, for him the 
        important notion was that adaptations emerged on a "whatever" basis: that 
        is, the process involved selection--at random--leading to <EM>whatever</EM> 
        structures that might ultimately serve a population's persistence. As 
        both Wallace and Darwin believed, natural selection could not produce 
        <EM>more</EM> than what was needed to persist; instead it merely continued 
        to reduce inefficiency of system operation by eliminating its weak links. 
        But again, this in itself is not evolution. I submit that one has to understand 
        the information that is part and parcel of organized adaptive structure 
        at any given time as a <EM>potential</EM> only: that is, a potential that 
        supports entries into new kinds of information-sharing networks at the 
        ecological/environmental level.</P>

<P> </P>

      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of stumbling-blocks to evolution 
        and evolutionary ecology that this kind of thinking directly overcomes; 
        for the present, only one particularly obvious application can be noted 
        briefly. This involves Wallace's supposed hyperselectionism (or closely 
        related panselectionism). Writers such as the late Stephen Jay Gould<SUP><a href="#19">19</a></SUP> 
        have criticized Wallace for arguing that natural selection represents 
        the only variation-accumulating mechanism, and for talking down the importance 
        of mutations and Mendelian inheritance to biological change. Two points 
        need to be made in this regard. First, while it is true that Wallace did 
        believe that all adaptive structures passed through the filter of natural 
        selection and were maintained in that fashion, he also noted on several 
        occasions that the "laws" of origin of the variations upon which the survival 
        of the fittest operated were quite unknown. He was thus more interested 
        in defending the primacy of natural selection as an evolutionary "shaping" 
        agent than he was in debating how variations came about to begin with.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, moreover, it can be seen that 
        through the model discussed here, there is nothing logically circular 
        about the way Wallace treated adaptations to begin with. Regardless of 
        whether adaptive structures may or may not be idiosyncratic in their purpose 
        and function as related to organismal success, they serve an <EM>evolutionary</EM> 
        function not in their deviation-countering (entropy maximizing) role, 
        but instead in their potential to propel a deviation-amplifying process 
        through environmental engagement. The latter represents a conceptually 
        different evolutionary outcome--spatial interaction at the ecological/population 
        level--than the adaptive structures themselves, and thus provides a venue 
        for hypothesis testing that does not fall prey to circular reasoning.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s such views fell on deaf ears; this 
        was a period in which more interest was being shown in the irreversible 
        thermodynamics modelling of E. O. Wiley and D. R. Brooks<SUP><a href="#20">20</a></SUP> 
        among biologists, and in the cladistic methodologies being perfected by 
        systematists and vicariance biogeographers.<SUP><a href="#21">21</a></SUP> Both of these 
        perspectives closely follow the generally Darwinian view that evolution 
        is not much more than a matter of phyletic diversification--"tree-thinking,"<SUP><a href="#22">22</a></SUP> 
        in the parlance of the period. This is not to suggest that either school 
        of thought depends directly on classic Darwinian views on speciation and 
        the like, but to acknowledge that each does tend to focus on organism-, 
        adaptation-centered, rather than ecologically-centered, outcomes.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a tempered revision of Darwinian 
        "tree-thinking" is likely to become increasingly evident as the challenges 
        of biodiversity conservation become ever greater. We cannot truly expect 
        to become shepherds of the earth's biotic resources before we secure a 
        firmer understanding of those supra-population forces that shape the evolutionary-ecological 
        interface, and the mere documentation of phyletic diversification, including 
        its further detailing into genomic inventories, is not enough to get the 
        job done. Clearly, we must look to evolutionary models that are more environmental 
        in their emphasis, or as Greer-Wooten described the matter back in 1972: 
        "in analyzing the dynamics of systems, the researcher should place more 
        emphasis on flows (of energy, materials, or information) between components 
        of the system, and the system and its environment, than on changed attributes 
        of the elements."<SUP><a href="#23">23</a></SUP> Wallace himself understood 
        this all the way back in the 1850s, ultimately reaching beyond his simple 
        phyletic determinism model of 1855 to produce a more integrated one invoking 
        environment-mediated stochasm: natural selection.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In now returning to Wallace's vision a final 
        time here, the following observations seem relevant. It will be recalled 
        that earlier I implied Wallace's adoption of a final-causes view of the 
        organization of the natural world was not limited to his later career 
        (as exemplified in his books <EM>Man's Place in the Universe</EM> in 1903 
        and <EM>The World of Life </EM>in 1910<SUP><a href="#24">24</a></SUP>), but was integral 
        to his pre-1858 positions as well. His search for a final cause relevant 
        to human societal functions led him to adopt spiritualism and socialism 
        (and, actually, for good reason<SUP><a href="#25">25</a></SUP>), but he never did give up 
        on the idea that more "removed" forces might be channelling the direction 
        of purely physical and biological nature as well. Hints of this leaning 
        turn up in a variety of contexts: for example, in his frequently stated 
        view that known laws of nature seem always to be subservient to more "recondite" 
        (his term) factors, in his familiar argument (adopted by many to this 
        day) that only Earth can possibly have observed the many physical/astronomical 
        constraints that have led to the evolution of advanced life-forms, in 
        his belief that natural selection often involves the change of less advanced 
        creatures according to the needs of more advanced ones, and in his continued 
        support of the overriding causal influence of Sclaterian faunal realm 
        development.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Wallace's thinking never included esoteric 
        notions of positive-negative feedback couplings or cybernetic relations, 
        it seems to me that his juxtaposition of a "governor model" of organism-environment 
        state-space (i.e., natural selection) onto an assumed final causes-based 
        evolution process is still both logical, and exploitable. Indeed, somewhat 
        abstract models of this kind are currently being offered up by proponents 
        both of the anthropic principle, and the Gaia hypothesis.<SUP><a href="#26">26</a></SUP> 
        More revealing ecogeographic models are possible as well, I think, if 
        we proceed generally as follows.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be apparent from the variety of positions 
        taken by proponents of the anthropic and Gaia hypotheses that, philosophically 
        speaking, the "final causes" concept has produced the gamut of teleological 
        mindsets. We need not adopt the more extreme of these to suggest how a 
        system as described here could find its way to higher levels of order, 
        however. Suppose, for example, that the environment as it physically extends 
        away from any given individual organism inherently presents statistically 
        greater survival probabilities in some directions than in others. On this 
        basis, individuals--and more importantly, populations--might tend to extend 
        more easily in some spatial directions than in others, in so doing entering 
        into new associations supported by new adaptations forced into existence 
        by such extensions.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us further suppose that these survival opportunities 
        are governed in the most general sense by the degree of optimality of 
        turnover and rate of availability of certain fundamental resources, for 
        example water. If we can make this argument, we might also be able to 
        argue that the degree of specification of selection required to fit into 
        the more ideal environments will be less than that required to fit into 
        less ideal ones: that is, that because there is too much or too little 
        of something vital at certain times and places, a good deal more selection 
        must go into establishing adaptations that will continue to support morphostasis 
        in those places. This latter kind of selection will ultimately lead to 
        the kinds of specialized organisms that will be evolutionarily at risk 
        should the environment change markedly at some future point.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has just been described can be interpreted 
        as a mild form of final causation: it suggests that <EM>all</EM> populations 
        will <EM>tend</EM> to disperse in preferred directions, and in so doing 
        non-randomly perpetuate genetic flexibility. This is evolution--environmentally 
        mediated (or even directed) evolution, to be sure, but not environmentally 
        <EM>determined</EM> evolution: again, as in Wallace's thinking, that which 
        is selected for to meet the challenge constitutes <EM>whatever</EM> can 
        be genetically sorted out, in large part by trial and error, to support 
        persistence. In earlier writings<SUP><a href="#27">27</a></SUP> I imagined an environmental 
        "potential information field" over which populations dispersed and evolved 
        in this way. The magnitude of the potential was identified through an 
        index combining idealness of a location's annual soil moisture budget 
        with its degree of deviation from mean planetary temperature conditions 
        (to produce a resource turnover rate surrogate conceptually linked to 
        Van't Hoff's law). I theorized that, as a statistical whole, the shapes 
        and orientations of geographic ranges of populations should reflect such 
        a spatially-varying driving mechanism, and in fact was able to elicit 
        empirical support to back this hypothesis.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years other investigators<SUP><a href="#28">28</a></SUP> 
        have been attempting to understand spatial variation in diversity patterns 
        through approaches that share some of these objectives, but these efforts 
        have so far lacked the dynamic modelling perspective that allows them 
        to do more than correlate certain diversity characteristics with particular 
        ambient environmental conditions. These are not, therefore, evolutionary 
        models as they now stand, but it would not take much re-orientation of 
        purpose to turn them into such. Efforts of this kind might give us a much 
        more interactive view of the meaning of biodiversity, and at the same 
        time allow us to overcome the logical dilemma that R. C. Lewontin remarked 
        upon in an essay published in 1984: "The process is adaptation and the 
        end result is the state of being adapted. . . The problem is how species 
        can be at all times both adapting and adapted."<SUP><a href="#29">29</a></SUP> In fact, 
        all we need do is follow Wallace's lead and understand that there <EM>is</EM> 
        no "process of adaptation": only the <EM>result</EM> of stochastically-accumulated 
        adaptive structures that recapitulate past and present ecological associations, 
        and that generate actions eventually playing out in space and time as 
        responses to final causes inherent in the environmental delivery system. 
        Through the deliberate elucidation of such causes we might finally elevate 
        ourselves from the incomplete and under-nourishing evolutionary philosophy 
        that a strict form of Darwinian "tree-thinking" produces--and at long 
        last claim, with justice, an allegiance to "Wallace's Unfinished Business."</P>

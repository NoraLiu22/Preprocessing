/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p align="center"><font size="+1"><br /><strong>Physiological Selection and the 
        Origin of Species (S390: 1886)</strong></font></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 467]]</font> As Mr. 
        Romanes has referred to my article in the current number of the <em>Fortnightly 
        Review</em>, and stated that he is prepared to answer what he terms &quot;the 
        very obvious exceptions&quot; which I have taken to his theory, I shall be 
        glad to be allowed to state, very briefly, what those exceptions are, 
        and to give an illustration of one of the more important of them.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Mr. Romanes makes a great deal of the alleged 
        &quot;inutility of specific characters,&quot; and founds upon it his extraordinary 
        statement that, during his whole life, Darwin was mistaken in supposing 
        his theory to be &quot;a theory of the origin of species,&quot; and that all Darwinians 
        who have believed it to be so have blindly fallen into the same error. 
        I allege, on the contrary, that there is no proof worthy of the name that 
        specific characters are frequently useless, and I adduce a considerable 
        series of facts tending to prove their general utility.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In support of his view as to the swamping 
        effects of intercrossing, Mr. Romanes objects to the assumption of Darwin, 
        &quot;that the same variation occurs simultaneously in a number of individuals,&quot; 
        adding: &quot;Of course, if this assumption were granted, there would be an 
        end of the present difficulty&quot;; and his whole argument on this branch 
        of the question rests on the assumption being false. I adduce evidence--copious 
        evidence--that the supposed assumption represents a fact, which is now 
        one of the best-established facts of natural history.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Mr. Romanes states, as the special feature 
        of his physiological varieties, that &quot;they cannot escape the preserving 
        agency of physiological selection.&quot; He gives no particle of proof of this, 
        while I show that, on the contrary, it is hardly possible for them to 
        survive to a second or third generation. It is on this point that I wish 
        to give an illustration. Mr. Romanes speaks of his supposed variations 
        as &quot;showing some degree of sterility with the parent form,&quot; while continuing 
        to be fertile &quot;within the limits of the varietal form&quot;; but I hold that 
        any such variety (beyond single individuals) can hardly exist, while he 
        has adduced no proof whatever of their existence. To show the improbability 
        of their existence, let us suppose a definite case.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a given species there is born an individual, 
        A, which is infertile with the bulk of the species, but fertile with some 
        few individuals of the opposite sex, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>. 
        Let there be a second individual, E, born from other parents in another 
        part of the area occupied by the species, and fertile only with <em>e</em>, 
        <em>f</em>, <em>g</em>. Other individuals, K, P, R, &amp;c., may have 
        similar relations, each infertile with the bulk of the species, fertile 
        only with a few individuals which may be termed their physiological complements. 
        Now each of these, separately, is a physiological variety, but the whole 
        set, A, E, K, P, R, do not form one, but five distinct varieties. To form 
        one variety all of them must be fertile with the same identical set of 
        individuals of the opposite sex, and this seems to me to be so highly 
        improbable that it must not be assumed till rigidly proved. Yet there 
        is not one passage in Mr. Romanes' paper to show that he recognised this 
        difficulty; on the contrary, he always speaks as if any number of separate 
        physiological variations within one species must necessarily form one 
        variety. It will easily be seen that the chances against any single variety 
        of this nature being preserved are overwhelmingly great. For, first, at 
        least two of the complementary individuals must survive to the breeding-season, 
        and the chances against this are measured by the fertility of the species. 
        If it produces ten young each year, the chances are between nine and ten 
        to one against any one of them surviving. The chances against the <em>two 
        </em>complements surviving will be about ninety to one; and then there 
        remains the chances against the two meeting at the breeding-season, for, 
        by the assumption, there is nothing whatever to bring them together but 
        chance, and this may be any number of thousands to one.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, no doubt, other possible cases in 
        which the physiological variety might be continued, but, as I have shown 
        in my <font color="990000">[[p. 468]]</font> paper, the chances<strong> 
        </strong>against it are always very great. Here, then, are three objections 
        to Mr. Romanes' theory which seem to me to be weighty and fundamental; 
        yet he says, in effect, that he anticipated, and is prepared to answer, 
        them. This, I must say, puzzles me; because in the whole of his lengthy 
        paper, occupying seventy-five pages, I cannot find any adequate recognition 
        of their existence, or any attempt whatever to answer them.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My apology for writing this is that I am shortly 
        leaving England, and wish the readers<strong> </strong>of <em>Nature, 
        </em>who may not have seen the <em>Fortnightly</em>, to be aware of the 
        character of the objections which Mr. Romanes declares that he anticipated, 
        but apparently thought of too little importance to require any discussion 
        in his paper.</p>

</p><p align="center"><br /><font size="+1"><strong>Mr. Romanes on Physiological Selection 
        (S395: 1887)</strong></font></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 366]]</font> I have 
        just seen Mr. Romanes's article in the <em>Nineteenth Century</em>, and 
        his letter specially<sup></sup> replying to myself in your issue of January 
        13 (p. 247). I do not propose to continue the discussion, but ask leave 
        to make a few observations on some features of his reply in both the article 
        and the letter.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the &quot;inutility of specific 
        characters,&quot; he appeals to authority against me, and especially to Darwin's 
        very cautious remarks, which seem to me to support my view much more than 
        they do those of Mr. Romanes; but in any case this is a matter in which 
        I decline to accept authority as an infallible guide. The impossibility 
        of proving a negative is proverbial, but my opponent declares that his 
        negative--the uselessness of specific characters--wants no proving, but 
        must be accepted till in every case the affirmative is proved. Here, again, 
        is a canon of criticism the validity of which I wholly <strong></strong>deny.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the swamping effects of intercrossing, 
        there is again an appeal to authority, and Mr. Romanes now explains away 
        (in the <em>Nineteenth Century</em>) what he had said about &quot;simultaneous 
        variations,&quot; by asking me to show such variations as the occurrence of 
        an incipient spur on a duck's foot or horn on the head of a racehorse, 
        in the belief, apparently, that these are the class of characters which 
        are distinctive of closely-allied species! Such a demand, seriously made, 
        appears to me so preposterous as to render further discussion of the matter 
        with such an adversary out of the question.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument to show that the supposed physiological 
        variations would be perpetuated, seems to me as weak and unsatisfactory 
        as ever. The question is really not worth further discussion till the 
        required variations are proved to exist in the requisite abundance and 
        possessing the peculiar relations to each other and to the rest of the 
        species which would alone give them any chance of survival.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now leave the question, as between myself 
        and Mr. Romanes, to the consideration of those naturalists who may be 
        able to bestow upon it the requisite time and attention.</p>

        (S428: 1890)</strong></font></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 79]]</font> In his 
        two latest articles dealing with this subject, Dr. Romanes has made certain 
        statements as to my position in regard to it which call for a brief notice 
        on my part.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his original paper, and in the summary of 
        it published in <em>Nature</em>, Dr. Romanes adduced variations in regard 
        to fertility and sterility as the fundamental fact in physiological selection. 
        A few quotations will show this. He says: &quot;It becomes almost impossible 
        to doubt that the primary specific distinction (meaning sterility) is, 
        as a general rule, the primordial distinction&quot; (<em>Nature</em>, vol. 
        xxxiv. p. 339). Again, he enforces this as against Darwin's view that 
        sterility was a consequence or concomitant of other differences, as follows: 
        &quot;My theory, on the other hand, inverts this order, and supposes the primary 
        distinction to be likewise (in most cases) the primordial distinction&quot; 
        (<em>l.c.</em>, p. 363). This is very clear, but to show that he limited 
        the term &quot;physiological selection&quot; to the results supposed to arise from 
        this phenomenon, we have his reply to Mr. Galton, who urged a fact also 
        dwelt upon by Darwin--the psychological disinclination to mate between 
        many varieties--as an important factor in the differentiation of species: 
        &quot;Now I have fully recognized this principle as one amongst several others 
        which is accessory to, although independent of, physiological selection&quot; 
        (<em>l.c.</em>, p. 407). A little further on he again states his fundamental 
        fact thus: &quot;If my theory is true, it must follow, as Mr. Galton says, 
        that such unions would be more or less sterile, and, as this sterility 
        is itself the only variation which my theory supposes to have arisen <em>in 
        the first instance, ex hypothesi </em>we can have no means of observing 
        whether or not the individuals which present this variation 'consort with 
        outsiders,' or with those individuals which do not present it&quot; (<em>l.c.</em>, 
        p. 407). As if to leave no possible doubt as to the special point of his 
        new theory, he again enforces it in the following passage: &quot;And forasmuch 
        as the sexual separation arises only by way of a variation locally affecting 
        the reproductive system, when the variation is first sexually separated, 
        it will in all other respects resemble its parent stock, and so be able 
        to compete with it on equal terms&quot; (<em>l.c.</em>, p. 408).</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now surely all this makes it absolutely clear 
        that Dr. Romanes's theory of physiological selection, so far as it had 
        any originality, was founded on the supposition of sterility-variation 
        alone, arising in an otherwise undifferentiated species; and he claimed 
        that such variations &quot;cannot escape the preserving agency of physiological 
        selection,&quot; and that &quot;physiological selection must be quite as vigilant 
        as natural selection, and it seizes upon the comparatively unuseful variation 
        of sterility with even more certainty than natural selection can seize 
        upon any useful variations&quot; (<em>l.c.</em>, p. 364).</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These last statements, by the truth of which 
        alone the use of the term &quot;selection&quot; can be justified, I showed by two 
        carefully considered cases to be absolutely unfounded, and the exact opposite 
        of what must really occur (<em>l.c.</em>, p. 467; and &quot;Darwinism,&quot; p. 
        182). Having thus proved that &quot;physiological <em>selection</em>,&quot; in the 
        only form claimed by Dr. Romanes as original, does not exist, and that 
        the only modes by which degrees of sterility between distinct species 
        can arise are those discussed or suggested by Darwin himself, with the 
        addition of the possible action of natural selection in increasing incipient 
        sterility between slightly differentiated forms, will it be believed that 
        I am accused of having appropriated the theory of physiological selection 
        without acknowledgment! In the <em>Nineteenth Century </em>(May 1890, 
        p. 831), Dr. Romanes says of me: &quot;He presents an alternative theory to 
        explain the same class of facts. Yet this theory is, purely and simply, 
        without any modification whatsoever, a restatement of the first principles 
        of physiological selection, as these were originally stated by myself.&quot; 
        And now, in the October issue of an American magazine, <em>The Monist</em>, 
        he has an article entitled &quot;Mr. A. R. Wallace on Physiological Selection,&quot; 
        in which the original main point, of sterility-variations alone leading 
        to and constituting &quot;physiological selection,&quot; is almost entirely ignored, 
        and the various modes by which isolation is produced between incipient 
        species or in which infertility arises in correlation with other divergent 
        characters, are all claimed as forming part of the theory of physiological 
        selection. He quotes from &quot;Darwinism&quot; my exposition of the effects of 
        partial infertility arising between &quot;two varieties in process of adaptation 
        to somewhat different modes of life within the same area,&quot; to show &quot;how 
        unequivocal and complete is Mr. Wallace's adoption of our theory&quot; <em>(The 
        Monist</em>, No. I, p. II). &quot;Our&quot; refers to Mr. Gulick, who is taken into 
        partnership by Dr. Romanes. And again he speaks of &quot;the peculiar position 
        to which he has eventually gravitated with reference to my views--professing 
        hostility on the one hand, while reproducing them as original on the other&quot; 
        (<font face="€€"><em>l.c.</em></font>, p. 19).</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here confined myself to showing, by Dr. 
        Romanes's own repeated and emphatic statements, what was the essential 
        and original theory to which he gave the name of &quot;physiological selection.&quot; 
        The whole of this special doctrine I have argued against as unsound, because, 
        on close examination, it proves to be quite inadequate to produce any 
        such effects as are claimed for it. Whether I was right or wrong in doing 
        so, I did, as a matter of fact, and do still, wholly reject this fundamental 
        and essential part of the theory--the only part which had even a <em>prim&acirc; 
        facie</em> claim to originality. I also totally reject the two subsidiary 
        doctrines on which Dr. Romanes lays great stress as adjuncts of his theory--that 
        of the inutility of a large proportion of specific characters, and that 
        of the power of isolation alone &quot;without the aid of natural selection&quot; 
        to produce new species; while, so far as I know, the only points in which 
        I agree with him are those in which we both make use of Darwin's facts 
        and adopt Darwin's explanation of them. Yet, notwithstanding this rejection 
        of all that is special in his teachings, Dr. Romanes has the hardihood 
        to assert that I claim them as my own; that I merely restate his theory 
        &quot;purely and simply, without any modification whatsoever&quot;; and that my 
        adoption of his theory &quot;is unequivocal and complete.&quot;</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave it to others to characterize these extraordinary 
        statements in the terms that fitly apply to them.</p>

</p><p align="center"><br /><font size="+1"><strong>Dr. Romanes on Physiological Selection 
        (S429: 1890)</strong></font> </p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 150]]</font> As Dr. 
        Romanes now declares that the essence of his theory of physiological selection 
        is &quot;that some amount of infertility characterizes the distinct varieties 
        which are in process of differentiation into species,&quot; and that the occurrence 
        of infertility among the members of an undifferentiated species is secondary 
        and comparatively unimportant, I ask leave to quote one or two more of 
        his original statements, in addition to the four emphatic passages quoted 
        in my communication of November 27.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) &quot;When accidental variations of a non-useful 
        kind occur in any of the other systems or parts of organisms, they are, 
        as a rule, immediately extinguished by intercrossing. But whenever they 
        happen to arise in the reproductive system in the way here suggested, 
        they must inevitably tend to be preserved as new natural varieties, or 
        incipient species. <em>At first the difference would only be in respect 
        of the reproductive system; but eventually, on account of independent 
        variation, other differences would supervene, and the new variety would 
        take rank as a new species</em>&quot;(<em>Nature</em>, vol. xxxiv. p. 316).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words I have italicized show clearly that 
        variation in fertility only was what Dr. Romanes then claimed as essential 
        to his theory. Again, after referring to variations in the season of flowering 
        as a &quot;well-known and frequently observed cause&quot; of isolation, he adds:--</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) &quot;But it is on what may be called spontaneous 
        variability of the reproductive system itself that I mainly rely for evidence 
        of physiological selection&quot; (<em>l.c.</em>, p. 337).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of this is still further enforced 
        by other passages. After discussing the supposed causes of infertility, 
        he says:--</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) &quot;Why should we suppose that, unlike all 
        other such variations, it can never be independent, but must always be 
        superinduced as a secondary result of changes taking place elsewhere? 
        It appears to me that the only reason why evolutionists suppose this is 
        because the particular variation in question happens to have as its result 
        the origination of species&quot; (<em>l.c.</em>, p. 339).</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again:--</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) &quot;It appears to me much the more rational 
        view that the primary specific distinction is likewise, as a rule, the 
        primordial distinction; and that <em>the cases where it has been superinduced 
        by the secondary distinctions are comparatively few in number</em>&quot; (<em>l.c.</em>).</p>
      <p></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the passages I have now quoted, 
        emphasizing eight times over, in different ways, that the theory is essentially 
        one of variations as regards fertility and sterility alone, Dr. Romanes 
        now says that, even if all this is wrong, &quot;the principle of physiological 
        selection, as I have stated it, is not thereby affected.&quot; If this is not 
        an absolute change of front, words have no meaning; and it is further 
        shown to be so by the fact that Dr. Romanes acknowledged that Mr. Catchpool 
        had &quot;very clearly put forward the theory of physiological selection.&quot; 
        But Mr. Catchpool clearly distinguished between the old theory that species 
        arise <em>first </em>by variation in form and structure, and only <em>gradually</em> 
        become mutually infertile, and the new theory that they arise &quot;by spontaneous 
        variations in the generative elements, and are in this case <em>originally</em> 
        mutually infertile, but only <em>gradually</em> become otherwise divergent&quot; 
        (<em>l.c.</em>, vol. xxxi. p. 4).</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this was the essential and original &quot;physiological 
        selection,&quot; that was claimed as supplying the missing link required to 
        make the origin of species by natural selection a reality, is yet further 
        shown by the repeated statements that physiological &quot;selection&quot; is a powerful 
        preservative agent. Besides the statement already quoted, that variations 
        in fertility &quot;cannot escape the preserving agency of physiological selection,&quot; 
        we have the assertion, quoted above, that such variations &quot;must inevitably 
        tend to be preserved as new natural varieties or incipient species,&quot; and 
        the following still more emphatic assertion:--&quot;Neither are we concerned 
        with the degrees of sterility which the variation in question may in any 
        particular case supply. For whether the degree of sterility with the parent 
        form be originally great or small, the result of it will in the long run 
        be the same: the only difference will be that in the latter case a greater 
        number of generations would be required in order to separate the varietal 
        from the parent form.&quot;</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now my contention has always been, and still 
        is, that there is no principle at work which can accumulate or even preserve 
        the variations of infertility occurring in an otherwise undifferentiated 
        species, and that the term physiological &quot;selection&quot; is therefore a misnomer, 
        and altogether misleading. If Dr. Romanes will carefully work out numerically 
        (as I have attempted to do) a few cases showing the preservative and accumulative 
        agency of pure physiological selection within an otherwise undifferentiated 
        species, he will do more for his theory than volumes of general disquisition 
        or any number of assertions that it <em>does</em> possess this power.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next contention is, that this is the only 
        new part of his theory--as he himself shows by his reference to the ordinary 
        view, of sterility following other changes, as that which &quot;evolutionists 
        suppose.&quot; All the rest is to be found more or less fully discussed in 
        Darwin's works; and I myself claim only to have carefully studied Darwin's 
        facts, and his brief but most suggestive discussion of them in his chapter 
        on &quot;Hybridism&quot; (vol. ii. of &quot;Animals and Plants under Domestication&quot;), 
        and by arranging them more systematically to have shown that they do really 
        give a fairly consistent and sufficient solution of the problem. The only 
        part of my work I claim as a distinct addition to the theory is the proof 
        that, under certain conditions that appear to me probable, natural selection 
        <em>is</em> capable of increasing incipient infertility between distinct 
        races or varieties; and the same view was submitted to Darwin twenty years 
        ago.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I totally and emphatically deny that 
        any portion of my facts or conclusions on the subject were derived from 
        Dr. Romanes's writings on &quot;physiological selection.&quot; The only two sentences 
        he has quoted from my book to prove that I have done so merely express 
        what he himself has declared to be the common opinion of evolutionists, 
        and which is also the direct outcome of the facts collected by Darwin. 
        If this is &quot;the whole essence of physiological selection,&quot; then physiological 
        selection is but a re-statement and amplification of Darwin's own views, 
        since he certainly assumed, and proved, that &quot;some amount of infertility&quot; 
        characterized &quot;some varieties&quot; of animals and plants, and that this infertility, 
        when it occurs, is of some use in preventing the swamping effects of intercrossing. 
        I feel sure that if <em>this</em> had been stated, at the outset, to be 
        what was termed &quot;physiological selection,&quot; no discussion would have arisen 
        as to the principle involved, but only as to its novelty and as to the 
        appropriateness of the name given to it.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If now, notwithstanding his repeated and emphatic 
        statements that variation as regards fertility in otherwise undifferentiated 
        species was what constituted the basis of his theory of physiological 
        selection, Dr. Romanes continues to assert that I have adopted that theory 
        &quot;purely and simply, without any modification whatever,&quot; it will show that 
        our respective standards of scientific reasoning and literary consistency 
        are so entirely different as to render any further discussion of the subject 
        on my part unnecessary as regards myself and useless as regards Dr. Romanes.</p>

        <strong><i><font color="993366">Comment by Prof. Donald R. Forsdyke, Queen's University, 
        Canada (pers. commun. 2/04):</font></i></strong>
      </p><p align="left"><i>To savour fully the fascinating debate between Wallace 
        and Romanes on the pages of journals such as <u>Nature</u> and <u>Fortnightly Review</u>, 
        the reader should consult the original texts of Romanes in addition to 
        the Wallace texts displayed here. I would like to draw attention to the 
        important term &quot;physiological complements&quot; which Wallace introduces to 
        characterize individuals (in say group A) that have diverged from most 
        other species members (the &quot;bulk species&quot;). They have diverged in some 
        unspecified (abstract) aspect of their reproductive systems to the extent 
        that, when crossed with members of the bulk species, the offspring, although 
        otherwise healthy, would tend to be sterile. Thus, even though the offspring 
        were healthy, the parents of such sterile offspring would tend to be reproductively 
        isolated from each other (and the line could not continue). This identifies 
        individuals A as potential members of an incipient new species. Romanes 
        postulated that, although diverged from the bulk species, A individuals 
        might not be reproductively isolated from each other to the same extent 
        as they were reproductively isolated from members of the bulk species. 
        So A x A crosses could result in some healthy non-sterile offspring, thus 
        allowing the deviant A line to continue. A with A would be physiological 
        complements, but A with a member of the bulk species would not be physiological 
        complements.</i>
      </p><p align="left"><i>Wallace acknowledges that a (say) male individual of 
        genetic constitution A might produce fertile offspring if crossed with 
        females of genetic constitutions a, b or c, where b and c might be different 
        in some (abstract) aspect of their reproductive systems (other than being 
        of the opposite sex to A):</i>
</p><blockquote>
        <p align="left"><i> <font size="-1">&quot;In a given species there is born an 
          individual, A, which is infertile with the bulk of the species, but 
          fertile with some few individuals of the opposite sex, a, b, c&quot;.</font></i> 
      </p></blockquote>
      <p align="left"><i>The latter are not bulk species members. However, he 
        seems to have seen fertility in black-and-white terms:</i>
</p><blockquote>
        <p align="left"><i><font size="-1">&quot;Let there be a second individual, E, 
          born from other parents in another part of the area occupied by the 
          species, and fertile only with e, f, g. Other individuals, K, P, R, 
          &amp;c., may have similar relations, each infertile with the bulk of the 
          species, fertile only with a few individuals which may be termed their 
          physiological complements. Now each of these, separately, is a physiological 
          variety, but the whole set, A, E, K, P, R, do not form one, but five 
          distinct varieties. To form one variety all of them must be fertile 
          with the same identical set of individuals of the opposite sex, and 
          this seems to me to be so highly improbable that it must not be assumed 
          till rigidly proved.&quot;</font></i> 
      </p></blockquote>
      <p align="left"><i>What is missing is that Wallace does not acknowledge 
        the possibility of degrees of reproductive incompatibility. At the outset, 
        individuals of group A might be more likely to produce fertile offspring 
        when crossed with another group A member than when crossed with a member 
        of sets E, K, P and R. But some of the offspring of the latter crosses 
        might be fertile. On the other hand, individuals of group A (or E, K, 
        P and R) do not (by Wallace's definition) produce fertile offspring when 
        crossed with average members of the bulk species. The possibility of some 
        fertile offspring is absent. In this way an initially very small reproductive 
        advantage (affecting members of one or more of groups A, E, K, P and R) 
        might allow the preservation of a collective entity whose members could 
        interbreed. The effects of natural selection (should any potential beneficial 
        phenotypic differences from the bulk species emerge) would then not be 
        countermanded by blending effects (see <a href="http://post.queensu.ca/%7Eforsdyke/evolutio.htm">http://post.queensu.ca/~forsdyke/evolutio.htm</a>).

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: A short essay Wallace communicated 
            to the Psychical Congress held in Chicago in August 1893. This paper 
            became one of Wallace's most reprinted works during his own lifetime, 
            and was later integrated into the Preface of the third edition of 
            <u>Miracles and Modern Spiritualism</u> in 1896. The source of the 
            transcription below is the 15 September 1893 issue of <u>The Two Worlds</u>, 
            a Manchester (U.K.) spiritualism magazine. Original pagination indicated 
            within double brackets. To link directly to this page,

<p><br /><font color="990000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[p. 440]]</font> Having 
          been more or less acquainted with psychical phenomena for half a century 
          it appears to me that a few notes of opinion I have witnessed during 
          that period may not be uninteresting to the Congress. I must apologise 
          for the brief and fragmentary nature of the communication, having neither 
          time nor materials for a more detailed statement.</p>
        
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about the year 1843 that I first became 
        interested in psychical phenomena owing to the violent discussion then 
        going on as to the reality of the painless surgical operations performed 
        by Dr. Elliotson and other English surgeons on patients in the mesmeric 
        trance. The greatest surgical and psychological authorities of the day 
        declared that the patients were either impostors or persons naturally 
        insensible to pain; the operating surgeons were accused of bribing their 
        patients; and Dr. Elliotson was accused of &quot;polluting the temple of science.&quot; 
        The Medico Chirurgical Society opposed the reading of a paper describing 
        an amputation during the magnetic trance, while Dr. Elliotson himself 
        was ejected from his professorship in the University of London. It was 
        at this time generally believed that all the now well-known phenomena 
        of hypnotism were the result of imposture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It so happened 
          that in the year 1844 I heard an able lecture on mesmerism by Mr. Spencer 
          Hall, and the lecturer assured his audience that most healthy persons 
          could mesmerise some of their friends, and reproduce many of the phenomena 
          he had shown on the platform. This led me to try for myself, and I soon 
          found that I could mesmerise with varying degrees of success, and before 
          long I succeeded in producing in my own room, either alone with my patient 
          or in the presence of friends, most of the usual phenomena. Partial 
          or complete catalepsy, paralysis of the motor nerves, in certain directions, 
          or of any special sense, every kind of delusion produced by suggestion, 
          insensibility to pain, and community of sensation with myself when at 
          a considerable distance from the patient, were all demonstrated, in 
          such a number of patients and under such varied conditions as to satisfy 
          me of the genuiness of the phenomena. I thus learnt my first great lesson 
          in the inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept 
          the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, 
          as of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation of facts by 
          other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science 
          shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have 
          denied the facts of other investigators on <font color="990000">[[p. 
          441]]</font> <em>a priori</em> grounds of absurdity or impossibility, 
          the deniers have always been wrong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later, 
          and all the more familiar facts of mesmerism were accepted by medical 
          men, and explained more or less satisfactorily to themselves, as not 
          being essentially different from known diseases of the nervous system; 
          and of late years the more remarkable phenomena, including clairvoyance 
          both as to facts known and those unknown to the mesmeriser, have been 
          established as absolute realities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we come to 
          the researches of Baron von Reichenbach on the action of magnets and 
          crystals upon sensitives. I well remember how these were scouted by 
          the late Dr. W. B. Carpenter and by Professor Tyndall, and how I was 
          pitied for my credulity in accepting them. But many of his results have 
          now been tested by French and English observers and have been found 
          to be correct.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we all remember 
          how the phenomena of the stigmata, which have occurred at many epochs 
          in the Catholic church, were always looked upon by sceptics as gross 
          imposture and the believers in its reality as too far gone in credulity 
          to be seriously reasoned with. Yet when the case of Louise Lateau was 
          thoroughly investigated by sceptical physicians and could be no longer 
          doubted, the facts were admitted, and when, later on, somewhat similar 
          appearances were produced in hypnotic patients by suggestion, the whole 
          matter was held to be explained.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second-sight, 
          crystal-seeing, automatic writing, and allied phenomena have been usually 
          treated either as self-delusion or as imposture, but now that they have 
          been carefully studied by Mr. Myers, Mr. Stead, and other enquirers, 
          they have been found to be genuine facts; and it has been further proved 
          that they often give information not known to any one present at the 
          time, and even sometimes predict future events with accuracy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trance mediums 
          who give similar information to that obtained through crystal seeing 
          or automatic writing, have long been held up to scorn as impostors of 
          the grossest kind. They have been the butt of newspaper writers, and 
          have been punished for obtaining money under false pretences; yet when 
          one of these trance mediums, the well-known Mrs. Piper, was subject 
          to a stringent examination by some of the acutest members of the Society 
          for Psychical Research, the unanimous testimony was that there was no 
          imposture in the case, and that, however the knowledge exhibited was 
          acquired, Mrs. Piper herself could never have acquired it through the 
          medium of her ordinary senses.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing has been 
          more constantly disbelieved and ridiculed than the alleged appearance 
          of phantasms of the living or of the recently dead, whether seen by 
          one person alone, or by several together. Imagination, disease, imposture, 
          or erroneous observation have been again and again put forth as sufficient 
          explanation of these appearances. But when carefully examined they do 
          not prove to be impostures, but stand out with greater distinctness 
          as veridical and sometimes objective phenomena, as is sufficiently proved 
          by the mass of well attested and well sifted evidence published by the 
          Society for Psychical Research. Still more subject to ridicule and contempt 
          are ghosts and haunted houses. It has been said that these disappeared 
          with the advent of gas; but so far from this being the case there is 
          ample testimony at the present day to phenomena which come under these 
          categories.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection 
          also we have not merely appearances, which may be explained away as 
          collective hallucinations, but actual physical phenomena of such a material 
          character as stone-throwing, bell-ringing, movements of furniture, independent 
          writing and drawing, and many other manifestations of force guided by 
          intelligence which is yet not the force or the intelligence of those 
          present. Records of such phenomena pervade history, and during the last 
          century and especially during the last half century, they have been 
          increasingly prevalent, and have been supported by the same kind and 
          the same amount of cumulative testimony as all the preceding classes 
          of phenomena. Some of these cases are now being investigated, and there 
          is no sign of their being traced to imposture. From personal knowledge 
          and careful experiments I can testify that some of these physical phenomena 
          are realities, and I cannot doubt that the fullest investigation will 
          result, as in all the other cases, in their recognition as facts which 
          any comprehensive theory must recognise and explain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are termed 
          spirit photographs, the appearance on a photographic plate of other 
          figures besides those of the sitters, often those of deceased friends 
          of the sitters, have now been known for more than twenty years. Many 
          competent observers have tried experiments successfully; but the facts 
          seemed too extraordinary to carry conviction to any but the experimenters 
          themselves, and any allusion to the subject has usually been met with 
          a smile of incredulity or a confident assertion of imposture. It mattered 
          not that most of the witnesses were experienced photographers who took 
          precautions which rendered it absolutely impossible that they were imposed 
          upon. The most incredible suppositions were put forth by those who only 
          had ignorance and incredulity to qualify them as judges, in order to 
          show that deception was possible. And now we have another competent 
          witness, Mr. Traill Taylor, for many years editor of the <em>British 
          Journal of Photography</em>, who, taking every precaution that his life-long 
          experience could suggest, yet obtained on his plates figures which, 
          so far as normal photography is concerned, ought not to have been there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we come 
          to consider the claim of the intelligences who are connected with most 
          of these varied phenomena to be the spirits of deceased men and women, 
          such claim being supported by tests of various kinds, especially by 
          giving accurate information regarding themselves as to facts totally 
          unknown to the medium or to any person present. Records of such tests 
          are numerous in spiritual literature as well as in the publications 
          of the Society for Psychical Research, but at present they are regarded 
          as inconclusive, and various theories of a double or multiple personality, 
          of a subconscious or second self, or of a lower stratum of consciousness 
          are called in to explain them or to attempt to explain them. The stupendous 
          difficulty that, if these phenomena and these tests are to be all attributed 
          to the &quot;second self&quot; of living persons, then that second self is almost 
          always a deceiving and a lying self, however moral and truthful the 
          visible and tangible first self may be, has, so far as I know, never 
          been rationally explained; yet this cumbrous and unintelligible hypothesis 
          finds great favour with those who have always been accustomed to regard 
          the belief in a spirit world, and more particularly a belief that the 
          spirits of our dead friends can and do sometimes communicate with us, 
          as unscientific, unphilosophical, and superstitious. Why it should be 
          unscientific, more than any other hypothesis which alone serves to explain 
          intelligibly a great body of facts, has never been explained. The antagonism 
          which it excites seems to be mainly due to the fact that it is, and 
          has long been in some form or other, the belief of the religious world 
          and of the ignorant and superstitious of all ages, while a total disbelief 
          in spiritual existence has been the distinctive badge of modern scientific 
          scepticism. But we find that the belief of the uneducated and unscientific 
          multitude rested on a broad basis of facts which the scientific world 
          scouted and scoffed at as absurd and impossible. Now, however, we are 
          discovering, as this brief sketch has shown, that the alleged facts 
          are one after another proved to be real facts, and, strange to say, 
          with little or no exaggeration, since almost every one of them, though 
          implying abnormal powers in human being or the agency of a spirit-world 
          around us, has been strictly paralleled in the present day, and has 
          been subjected to the close scrutiny of the scientific and sceptical 
          with little or no modification of their essential nature. Since, then, 
          the scientific world has been proved to have been totally wrong in its 
          denial of the facts, as being contrary to laws of nature and therefore 
          incredible, it seems highly probable, <em>a priori</em>, it may have 
          been equally wrong as to the spirit hypothesis, the dislike of which 
          mainly led to their disbelief in the facts. For myself, I never have 
          been able to see why any one hypothesis should be less scientific than 
          another, except so far as one explains the whole of the facts and the 
          other explains only a part of them. It was this alone that rendered 
          the theory of gravitation more scientific than that of cycles and epicycles, 
          the undulatory theory of light more scientific than the emission theory, 
          and the theory of Darwin more scientific than that of Lamarck. It is 
          often said that we must exhaust known causes before we call in unknown 
          causes to explain phenomena. This may be admitted, but I cannot see 
          how it applies to the present question. The &quot;second&quot; or &quot;sub-conscious 
          self&quot; with its wide stores of knowledge how gained no one knows, its 
          distinct character, its low morality, its constant lies, is as purely 
          a theoretical cause as is the spirit of a deceased person or any other 
          spirit. It can in no sense be termed &quot;a known cause.&quot; To call this hypothesis 
          &quot;scientific,&quot; and that of spirit agency &quot;unscientific&quot; is to beg the 
          question at issue. That theory is most scientific which best explains 
          the whole series of phenomena; and I therefore claim that the spirit-hypothesis 
          is the most scientific, since even those who oppose it most strenuously 
          often admit that it does explain all the facts, which cannot be said 
          of any other hypothesis. This very brief and very imperfect sketch of 
          the progress of opinion on the questions this Congress has met to discuss 
          leads us, I think, to some valuable and reassuring conclusions. We are 
          taught, first, that human nature is not so wholly and utterly the slave 
          of delusion as has sometimes been alleged, since almost every alleged 
          superstition is now shown to have had a basis of fact. Secondly, those 
          who believe, as I do, that spiritual beings can and do, subject to general 
          laws and for certain purposes, communicate with us, and even produce 
          material effects in the world around us, must see in the steady advance 
          of inquiry and of interest in these questions, the assurance that, so 
          far as their beliefs are logical deductions from the phenomena they 
          have witnessed, those beliefs will at no distant date be accepted by 
          all truth-seeking inquirers.</p>

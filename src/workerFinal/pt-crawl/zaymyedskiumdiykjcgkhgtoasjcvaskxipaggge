class="">The 2024 NFL draft has ended, which means it's time to gauge how every team fared over the three-day event. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">It's never fair to judge a specific pick or draft class before players have even taken the field, of course. However, we can assess how teams navigated the process by examining factors such as perceived value, positional value, team needs and how said needs were addressed. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Value is subjective, so for that, we'll utilize the Bleacher Report Scouting Department's <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117937-br-nfl-scouting-depts-final-2024-nfl-draft-big-board">final 2024 prospect rankings</a> as a guideline. Teams have their boards, but in determining whether a pick was a reach, a steal or just right, we'll stick to our own. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Individual team strategies and franchise trajectories will also be considered. Teams have different methods of approaching the draft and fall in different stages of the rebuilding/contending cycle, so these factors will be included on a franchise-specific basis. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Notable draft-day trades will also be factored in, where applicable. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">We'll have a far more accurate view of how each 2024 draft class stacks up in a few years. For now, let's assign some grades based on the information available. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Teams are listed in alphabetical order.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class=""><i>All draft classes graded by B/R NFL Scouting Department contributor </i><a href="https://twitter.com/Kris_Knox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kris Knox</a><i>.</i></p></div></ol></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide1"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-10118547-1" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50],[2,2]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h2>Draft Results</h2><div class="slideData">1 of 33</div><ol><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="iframe atom statmilk"><iframe id="https://statmilk.bleacherreport.com/NFL/DraftBoard/91626081/4511" class="content" src="https://statmilk.bleacherreport.com/NFL/DraftBoard/91626081/4511" width="100%" height="643" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The Bleacher Report Scouting Department's final draft board can be found <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117937-br-nfl-scouting-depts-final-2024-nfl-draft-big-board">here</a>. <br></p></div></ol></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide2"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-10118547-2" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_02" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50],[2,2]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h2>Arizona Cardinals</h2><div class="slideData">2 of 33</div><ol><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><div class="atom articleLeadImage blurUp"><img alt="Cardinals WR Marvin Harrison Jr. " src="https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/w_40,h_27,c_fill/v1714232481/l8gu9vo4bir6synvmmbp.jpg" itemProp="contentUrl"/></div></div><small><span class="caption">Cardinals WR Marvin Harrison Jr. </span><span itemProp="citation" class="credit">Sam Hodde/Getty Images</span></small></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>Round 1 (No. 4):

However, Arizona resisted the urge to move and instead took <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10090927-marvin-harrison-jr-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-ohio-state-wr">Marvin Harrison Jr.</a>, the top-rated prospect at any position on the Bleacher Report Scouting Department <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117937-br-nfl-scouting-depts-final-2024-nfl-draft-big-board">draft board</a>. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">"Harrison is a slam-dunk prospect. He is a twitched-up athlete with polished route-running ability and elite ball skills," Derrik Klassen of the B/R Scouting Department wrote. "It's so easy to see how his game translates right away."</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Could the Cardinals have gotten a haul from a QB-needy team by trading the fourth overall pick? Probably. Did they get an instant No. 1 receiver who is as bust-proof as a prospect can be? Absolutely. Considering Arizona's need for offensive playmakers, it was the perfect choice. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Missouri defensive lineman <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10105566-darius-robinson-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-missouri-dl">Darius Robinson</a> may have been a reach at No. 27—he was the 45th-ranked prospect on the B/R board—but his ability to fill a variety of roles along the defensive front will aid head coach Jonathan Gannon's defense. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Arizona added another piece for Gannon's defense by trading back in Round 2 and still securing Rutgers corner <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10095718-max-melton-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-rutgers-cb">Max Melton</a>. While Melton may not start right away, he'll provide depth for a secondary—along with third-round pick <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117539-elijah-jones-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-boston-college-cb">Elijah Jones</a>—that ranked 30th in net yards allowed per pass attempt last season. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Also on Day 2, the Cardinals added some balance to their offense by grabbing running back <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10095831-trey-benson-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-florida-state-rb">Trey Benson</a>. He'll immediately bring some burst to Arizona's ground game and may eventually replace James Conner as the lead back. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Lineman <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10101618-isaiah-adams-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-illinois-iol">Isaiah Adams</a> and tight end/fullback <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10116338-tip-reiman-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-illinois-te">Tip Reiman</a> will further boost the offense around Murray. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">General manager Monti Ossenfort threw a handful of darts at depth players on Day 3. <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10105506-christian-jones-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-texas-iol">Christian Jones</a> is a developmental offensive tackle who could earn a prominent role in the future, while <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10091034-xavier-thomas-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-clemson-edge">Xavier Thomas</a> might earn a spot in the pass-rush rotation within his first season or two. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">This was largely a volume draft for the Cardinals. While Ossenfort didn't exactly manage value from start to finish, Arizona had a ton of needs, and with a bevy of prospects, it stands a good chance of filling a few of them before the end of training camp. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Harrison was a slam-dunk pick at No. 4.

On a positive note, though, Penix is arguably the best deep-ball thrower in this class, and he'll have time to develop behind Cousins. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Still, taking Penix in the top 10 represents a major gamble, one that a team employing a Pro Bowl-caliber veteran didn't need to make. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">To open Day 2, Atlanta surrendered its third-round pick to move up to 35th overall to snag Clemson defensive lineman <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10091048-ruke-orhorhoro-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-clemson-dl">Ruke Orhorhoro</a>. This was a much more sensible selection for the Falcons, as Orhorhoro's schematic versatility, play strength and athleticism should make him a quality complement to standout defensive tackle Grady Jarrett. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">It was still surprising to see Orhorhoro go as highly as he did. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">In Round 3, the Falcons grabbed Washington's <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10091039-bralen-trice-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-washington-edge">Bralen Trice</a>, the fifth-ranked edge on the B/R board and a player who can help boost a Falcons defense that needed help on the edge. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">"Standing at 6'4" and nearly 275 pounds, Bralen Trice has a great frame for an NFL edge," <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10091039-bralen-trice-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-washington-edge">Matt Holder</a> of the B/R Scouting Department wrote.

Those players may develop enough to make this class look better than it currently does. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">However, the Penix pick is as questionable a selection as we've seen in recent memory. That's not a knock on Penix as a prospect, but the Falcons signed Cousins to win now.

Taylor was one of the most valuable players for Iowa this past season, and he can be a field-flipping difference-maker for Chicago at the next level. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Taylor was slated to be Chicago's final selection of 2024, but the Bears traded back in to take Kansas edge-rusher <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10105582-austin-booker-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-kansas-edge">Austin Booker</a>.

"With that said, it's a little worrisome that Nix is still unrefined in some areas as an older prospect with a ton of games under his belt."</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Given the lack of quarterback talent after the top six, though, flipping the switch here made some sense.

He easily could have gone higher in the draft order and fills a major need for the Denver defense. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The Broncos haven't had a high-end sack-artist since trading Bradley Chubb. Elliss might not be that right away, but he has the speed and first step needed to make an immediate impact and then develop from there. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">It wouldn't be a complete shock to see Elliss lead the Broncos in sacks as a rookie. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Getting <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10100192-troy-franklin-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-oregon-wr">Troy Franklin</a> in Round 4 was also a bargain for the Broncos, as the Oregon product could easily start in Denver's offense as a rookie. He can stretch the field and already has established chemistry with Nix. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">General manager George Paton added a couple of intriguing players on Day 3—<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10107765-audric-estime-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-notre-dame-rb">Audric Estimé</a> could be a very fun power back—but everything will hinge on his first selection. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Nix was drafted too highly. The fact that Denver felt pressured to get "its guy" doesn't change that fact. Head coach Sean Payton may well develop him into a capable starter, but that doesn't mean that taking Nix in the top half of Round 1 was the right decision. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class=""><b>Grade: C+</b><br></p></div></ol></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide12"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-10118547-12" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h2>Detroit Lions</h2><div class="slideData">12 of 33</div><ol><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><div class="atom articleLeadImage blurUp"><img alt="Lions CB Terrion Arnold" src="https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/w_40,h_27,c_fill/v1714232911/ltwimp7uggz0mj2gmcft.jpg" itemProp="contentUrl"/></div></div><small><span class="caption">Lions CB Terrion Arnold</span><span itemProp="citation" class="credit">Todd Rosenberg/Getty Images</span></small></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>Round 1 (No. 24):

He'll quickly help boost a Colts defense that ranked 28th in points allowed last season. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">After trading down in Round 2, the Colts added Texas wide receiver <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10100198-adonai-mitchell-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-texas-wr">Adonai Mitchell</a>. The former Longhorn combines good size (6'2", 205 lbs) with explosive ability and will give second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson another quality target in the passing game. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The Colts have struggled to solidify the interior of their offensive line in recent years, and they took another shot at filling the need by grabbing Pittsburgh's <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10115313-matt-goncalves-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-pittsburgh-iol">Matt Goncalves</a>. While Goncalves isn't a high-level athlete, he has a decent floor due to sound technique and good play strength. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">At worst, Goncalves should be a dependable backup for the next several seasons.

However, he's most likely to provide early value as an explosive return specialist and special teams ace. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">General manager Chris Ballard managed to find value throughout the draft while addressing a couple of key needs early. Indianapolis may have preferred to land one of the top pass-catchers at the very top of the draft. However, it still did a good job of improving Richardson's supporting cast while reloading a defense that ranked 28th in points allowed last season. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class=""><b>Grade: A</b><br></p></div></ol></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide16"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-10118547-16" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h2>Jacksonville Jaguars</h2><div class="slideData">16 of 33</div><ol><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><div class="atom articleLeadImage blurUp"><img alt="Jaguars WR Brian Thomas Jr." src="https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/w_40,h_27,c_fill/v1714233040/hjuiohkuml6iqpsdr4kb.jpg" itemProp="contentUrl"/></div></div><small><span class="caption">Jaguars WR Brian Thomas Jr.</span><span itemProp="citation" class="credit">John Smolek/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</span></small></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>Round 1 (No. 23):

It was somewhat surprising to see McKinstry fall out of the first round, but the versatile defensive back should soon pair with Marshon Lattimore to give New Orleans one of the better cornerback duos in the NFC.

Given the commitment Tampa has made to Baker Mayfield and its offense as a whole, taking him was a logical decision. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Tampa filled another need in Round 2 by grabbing Alabama edge-rusher <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10091040-chris-braswell-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-alabama-edge">Chris Braswell</a>. While Braswell needs to work on his run defense, he should contribute early as a situational edge-rusher and can help fill the void created by Shaquil Barrett's departure. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">In Round 3, the Bucs took versatile Georgia defensive back <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10105339-tykee-smith-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-georgia-cb">Tykee Smith</a>. With an ability to play safety or in the slot, Smith should boost the back end of Tampa's defense, possibly as early as Week 1 of this season. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Washington wideout <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10109405-jalen-mcmillan-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-washington-wr">Jalen McMillan</a> will give Tampa another reliable receiving option in 2024, as his secure hands and savvy route-running should immediately translate.

Improving one of the league's most lackluster offensive lines was a must. Taking Alabama's <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10089324-jc-latham-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-alabama-ot">JC Latham</a> at seventh overall should help with that. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">"He needs added patience to counterbalance his attacking play style, but he has the tools, skill set and runway to start in year one with Pro Bowl potential within his first contract," Thorn wrote. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Latham was ranked behind Penn State's <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10089320-olumuyiwa-fashanu-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-penn-state-ot">Olumuyiwa Fashanu</a> on the B/R Scouting Department's <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117937-br-nfl-scouting-depts-final-2024-nfl-draft-big-board">final big board</a>, so there may be some debate about the choice. However, it's hard not to love the upside Latham brings.

Because of those concerns—and concerns over his playing weight—some teams viewed him as a Day 3 prospect, according to ESPN's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2024/insider/story/_/id/39920454/2024-nfl-draft-latest-buzz-rumors-news-prospects-mock-risers-sleepers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matt Miller</a>. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The 6'4½", 366-pound defender may not fit the mold of a modern-day NFL defensive tackle. He offers little in the pass rush and has carried effort questions. He's a powerful space-eater who can contribute early, at least on a rotational basis, but it was an odd gamble for a Titans team that ranked seventh in yards allowed per carry last season. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">General manager Ran Carthon found a few intriguing prospects late—<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10105348-jarvis-brownlee-jr-nfl-draft-2024-scouting-report-for-louisville-cb">Jarvis Brownlee Jr.</a> has the potential to start at cornerback at some point in 2024—but this class isn't likely to push Tennessee into the playoff conversation right away. <br></p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Latham addresses arguably the team's biggest need, but the Titans still have questions in the secondary and at edge-rusher.

Newton is a legitimate playmaker who will immediately upgrade a defense that ranked 32nd overall last season.

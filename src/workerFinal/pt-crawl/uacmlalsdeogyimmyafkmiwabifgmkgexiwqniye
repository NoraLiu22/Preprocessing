/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modern doctrine of organic evolution may be said 
        to date from the great French naturalist Buffon, who, more than a hundred 
        years before the publication of the <em>Origin of Species</em>, clearly 
        indicated his belief in the mutability of specific and generic forms, 
        although, owing to the power of the Church in his day, he was often obliged 
        to veil his opinions under the guise of hypotheses, which, as they were 
        opposed to religion of course could not be true. Yet he occasionally speaks 
        very plainly, as when he says:--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;
      </p><blockquote><font size="-1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nature, I maintain, 
        is in a state of continual flux and movement;&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <p>and again--</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      </p><blockquote><font size="-1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What cannot Nature effect 
        with such means at her disposal? She can do all except either create matter 
        or destroy it. These two extremes of power the Deity has reserved for 
        Himself only; creation and destruction are the attributes of His omnipotence. 
        To alter and undo, to develop and renew--these are powers which He has 
        handed over to the charge of Nature.&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Erasmus Darwin held similar views, which he developed 
        at great length, and in doing so, anticipated many of the arguments afterwards 
        elaborated by the celebrated Lamarck, that changes in species were caused 
        both by the direct action of the environment, by the use and exercise 
        by animals of their several organs, and more especially by the effects 
        of effort and desire leading to the development of parts and organs calculated 
        to gratify those desires. The great French naturalists Geoffrey and Isidore 
        St. Hilaire adopted these views with certain modifications, as did a limited 
        number of German naturalists; while they were popularly set forth with 
        much knowledge and literary skill by the late Robert Chambers in his <em>Vestiges 
        of Creation</em>. Somewhat later the general theory of evolution was explained 
        and illustrated by Herbert Spencer with so much power and completeness 
        as to compel its acceptance by most thinkers; but neither he, nor any 
        of the great writers who had gone before him, had been able to overcome 
        the difficulty of explaining the process of organic evolution, since no 
        one had been able to show how the wonderful and complex adaptations of 
        living things to their environment could have been produced by means of 
        known laws and through causes proved to exist and to be of sufficient 
        potency. Alike for naturalists, for men of science in general, and for 
        students in philosophy, the <em>method</em> of organic evolution remained 
        an insoluble problem.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that this state of opinion prevailed 
        up to the very date <font color="#990000">[[p. 212]]</font> of publication 
        of the <em>Origin of Species</em>, the effect produced by that work was 
        certainly marvellous. A considerable body of the more thoughtful naturalists 
        at once accepted it as affording, if not a complete solution, yet a provisional 
        theory, founded upon incontrovertible facts of nature, demonstrating a 
        true cause for specific modification, and affording a satisfactory explanation 
        of those countless phenomena of adaptation which every preceding theory 
        had been powerless to explain. Further consideration and discussion only 
        increased the reputation of the author and the influence of his work, 
        which was still further enhanced by his <em>Animals and Plants under Domestication</em>, 
        published nine years later; and when this had been fully considered--about 
        twelve years after the publication of the <em>Origin</em>--a large proportion 
        of naturalists in every part of the world, including many of the most 
        eminent, had accepted Darwin's views, and acknowledged that his theory 
        of Natural Selection constituted--to use his own words--&quot;the main but 
        not the exclusive means of modification.&quot; The effect of Darwin's work 
        can only be compared with that of Newton's <em>Principia</em>. Both writers 
        defined and clearly demonstrated a hitherto unrecognised law of nature, 
        and both were able to apply the law to the explanation of phenomena and 
        the solution of problems which had baffled all previous writers.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of late years, however, there has arisen a reaction 
        against Darwin's theory as affording a satisfactory explanation of organic 
        evolution. In America, especially, the theories of Lamarck are being resuscitated 
        as of equal validity with natural selection; while in this country, besides 
        a considerable number of Lamarckians, some influential writers are introducing 
        the conception of there being definite positions of <em>organic stability</em>, 
        quite independent of utility and therefore of natural selection; and that 
        those positions are often reached by <em>discontinuous variation</em>, 
        that is, by spurts or sudden leaps of considerable amount, which are thus 
        &quot;competent to mould races without any help whatever from the process of 
        selection, whether natural or sexual.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> These 
        views have been recently advocated in an important work on variation,<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 
        which seems likely to have much influence among certain classes of naturalists; 
        and it is because I believe such views to be wholly erroneous and to constitute 
        a backward step in the study of evolution that I take this opportunity 
        of setting forth the reasons for my adverse opinion in a manner likely 
        to attract the attention not only of naturalists but of all thinkers who 
        are interested in these problems.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before proceeding to this special discussion it may 
        be well to illustrate briefly the essential difference between the theories 
        of <font color="#990000">[[p. 213]]</font> Darwin and those of his predecessors 
        and opponents, by a few examples of those cases of adaptation which are 
        insoluble by all other theories, but of which natural selection gives 
        an intelligible explanation.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Darwinian theory is based on certain facts of 
        nature which, though long known to naturalists, were not understood in 
        their relations to each other and to evolution. These facts are: variation, 
        rapid multiplication, and the resulting struggle for existence and survival 
        of the fittest. Variation is the fundamental fact, and its extent, its 
        diversity, and its importance are only now becoming fully recognised. 
        Observation shows that when large numbers of individuals of common species 
        are compared there is a considerable amount of variability in size, form, 
        colour, in number of repeated parts and other characters. Further, that 
        each separate part, which has been thus compared, varies, so that it may 
        be safely asserted that there is no part or organ that is not subject 
        to continual variation. Again, all these variations are of considerable 
        amount--not minute, or infinitesimal, or even small, as they are constantly 
        asserted to be. And, lastly, the parts and organs of each individual vary 
        greatly among themselves, so that each separate character, though sometimes 
        varying in correlation with other characters, yet possesses a considerable 
        amount of independent variability. The amount of the observed variation 
        is so great that in fifty or a hundred adult individuals of the same sex, 
        collected at the same time and place, the difference of the extreme from 
        the mean value of any organ or part is usually from one-tenth to one-fourth, 
        sometimes as great as one-third of the mean value, with usually a perfect 
        gradation of intervening values.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The multiplication of individuals of all species 
        is so great and so rapid that only a small proportion of those born each 
        year can possibly survive; hence the struggle for existence, the result 
        of which is that, on the average, those individuals which are in any way 
        ill-fitted for the conditions of existence die, while those better fitted 
        live. The struggle is of varied character and intensity--either with the 
        forces of nature, as cold, drought, storms, floods, snow, &amp;c.; with 
        other creatures, in order to escape being devoured, or to obtain food, 
        whether for themselves or for their offspring; or with their own race 
        in the competition for mates and for the means of existence; while as 
        regards all these forms of struggle mental and social qualities are often 
        as important as mere physical perfection, and sometimes much more important. 
        The fact already stated, of the large amount of variability in most species, 
        has been thought by some to show either that there can be no such severe 
        struggle as has been suggested, or that the characters which vary so much 
        can be of little importance to the species, and cannot therefore determine 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 214]]</font> survival. But in making this objection 
        two considerations have been overlooked. In the first place we always 
        compare adults, and an enormous amount of destruction has already taken 
        place during the earlier stages of life. The adults, therefore, are already 
        a selected group. In the second place, the struggle is very largely intermittent, 
        owing both to the occurrence only at long intervals of the most adverse 
        meteorological conditions, while the diversity of these conditions leads 
        in each case to the selection of a different characteristic. An exceptionally 
        severe winter will destroy all which are deficient in one set of characters, 
        while a long drought, or scarcity of some particular kind of food, will 
        weed out those deficient in another set of characters. Thus, in any one 
        year there will exist numbers of individuals which are doomed to speedy 
        destruction under some one of the special adverse conditions which are 
        constantly recurring; and it is this, probably, that explains why there 
        is so much individual variation continually present, although the central 
        or typical form remains unchanged for very long periods. This typical 
        form is that which, under existing conditions, survives all the periodical 
        or secular adverse changes, during which the outlying, or extreme variations 
        of whatever kind, are sooner or later eliminated. It is for want of giving 
        full weight to the essentially intermittent nature of the struggle for 
        existence that so many writers fail to grasp its full significance, and 
        continually set forth objections and difficulties which have no real importance.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now in a position to estimate the efficiency 
        of Darwin's theory in explaining the wondrous and complex adaptations 
        that abound in the organic world, as compared with that of Lamarck or 
        of his modern supporters. And first let us take the simple case of the 
        adaptation of fleshy and juicy fruits to be eaten by birds, causing what 
        seems at first sight an injury to the species, but which is really most 
        beneficial, inasmuch as it leads to the wide dispersal of the seeds, and 
        greatly aids in the perpetuation of the plants which produce such fruits. 
        To what possible direct action of the environment can we impute the production 
        of fleshy or juicy pulp, with attractive colour, and with small, hard-coated 
        seeds, in the innumerable fruits which are devoured by birds, through 
        whose bodies the seeds pass in a state fitted for germination? There is 
        here a combination of characters calculated to a certain end, a definite 
        adaptation. If we suppose that in an early stage of development ancestral 
        fruits which happened to be a little softer than others were eaten by 
        birds, how could that circumstance increase the softness, develop juice, 
        and produce colour in future generations of the trees or bushes that sprang 
        from the seeds so dispersed? And if we assume that these several characteristics 
        are positions of &quot;organic stability,&quot; acquired through accidental variation, 
        we have to ask why the <font color="#990000">[[p. 215]]</font> several 
        kinds of variation occurred together, or why neither of them occurred 
        in the numerous species in which to be eaten by birds would be injurious 
        instead of beneficial?</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we begin at the same stage and apply the Darwinian 
        theory we find that the whole process is easy of explanation. It is an 
        observed fact that fruits vary in softness, juicyness, and colour, and 
        seeds in the hardness or hairyness of their integuments. Any variation 
        of primitive fruits in either of these directions would therefore be beneficial, 
        by attracting birds to eat them and so disperse the seeds that they might 
        reach suitable stations for development and growth. Such favourable variations 
        would therefore be preserved, while the less favourable perished.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now ask the same questions as to the production of 
        the innumerable modes of dispersal of seeds by the wind, from the simple 
        compressed form and dilated margins of many small seeds, to the winged 
        seeds of the ash and maple, and the wonderful feathery parachute of the 
        thistle and the dandelion. Or again, inquire as to the wonderful springed-fruits 
        which burst so as to scatter the small seeds, as in some of the balsams; 
        or yet again, as to the sticky glands of the sundews, and the small water-traps 
        of the bladder-wort; and a hundred other equally strange adaptations to 
        some purpose of use to the species, but whose development has no relation 
        whatever to any possible direct action of the environment, though all 
        of them are explicable as the result of the successive preservation of 
        such variations as are known to occur, acting at various intervals, and 
        by means of successive modifications, during the whole period of the development 
        of the group from some remote ancestral form.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modern advocates of Lamarckism content themselves 
        with such simple cases as the strengthening or enlarging of organs by 
        use, the hardening of the sole of the foot by pressure, or the enlarging 
        of the stomach by the necessity for eating large quantities of less nutritious 
        food. These, and many other similar modifications, may doubtless be explained 
        by the direct action of conditions, if we admit that the change thus produced 
        in the individual is transmitted to the offspring. That such changes are 
        transmitted has, however, not yet been proved, and a considerable body 
        of naturalists reject such transmission as improbable in itself, and at 
        all events as not to be assumed without full and sufficient proof. But 
        even if accepted it will not help us to explain the very great number 
        of important adaptations which, like those already referred to, are quite 
        unrelated to any direct action of the environment. Having thus cleared 
        away some preliminary misconceptions, and stated in briefest outline the 
        main features of the law of natural selection, we may proceed to consider 
        the objections of those modern writers to whose works we have already 
        referred.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#990000">[[p. 216]]</font> Mr. Bateson's 
        large and important volume consists mainly of an extensive collection 
        of cases of variation of a particular kind, which have been met with throughout 
        the whole animal kingdom, and have been recorded in all parts of the world. 
        These are arranged systematically under nearly nine hundred numbered headings, 
        and are in many cases well illustrated by characteristic figures. The 
        character and morphological relations of these variations are often very 
        fully discussed with great knowledge and acuteness, and some original 
        views are set forth which are of interest both to morphologists and physiologists. 
        So far as this part of the work is concerned the present writer would 
        feel himself quite incompetent to criticise it, but would welcome it as 
        presenting in a convenient form a great body of interesting and little-known 
        facts. But the book goes far beyond this. The first words of the preface 
        tell us that &quot;This book is offered as a contribution to the study of the 
        problem of Species;&quot; and in a lengthy introductory and shorter concluding 
        chapters this problem is discussed in some detail, with the view of discrediting 
        the views held by most Darwinians; while a new theory, founded upon the 
        facts given in the body of the work, is set forth as being a more probable 
        one. It is therefore necessary to give some account of the nature of the 
        facts themselves, as well as of the particular theories they are held 
        to support.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darwin distinguished two classes of variations, which 
        he termed &quot;individual differences&quot; and &quot;sports.&quot; The former are small 
        but exceedingly numerous, the latter large but comparatively rare, and 
        these last are the &quot;discontinuous variations&quot; of Mr. Bateson to which 
        reference has been already made. Darwin, while always believing that individual 
        differences played the most important part in the origin of species, did 
        not altogether exclude sports or discontinuous variations, but he soon 
        became convinced that these latter were quite unimportant, and that they 
        rarely, if ever, served to originate new species; and this view is held 
        by most of his followers. Mr. Bateson, however, seems to believe that 
        the exact contrary is the fact, and that sports or discontinuous variations 
        are the all-important, if not the exclusive, means by which the organic 
        world has been modified. Such a complete change of base as to the method 
        of organic evolution deserves, therefore, to be considered in some detail.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty which seems to have struck Mr. Bateson 
        most, and which he declares to be of &quot;immense significance,&quot; is, that 
        while specific forms of life form a discontinuous series, the diverse 
        environments on which these primarily depend shade into each other insensibly, 
        and form a continuous series (p. 5). Further on, this objection is again 
        urged in stronger language: &quot;We have seen that the differences between 
        Species are Specific, and are differences of <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        217]]</font> kind, forming a discontinuous Series, while the diversities 
        of environment to which they are subject are on the whole differences 
        of degree, and form a continuous Series; it is therefore hard to see how 
        the environmental differences can thus be in any sense the directing cause 
        of Specific differences, which by the Theory of Natural Selection they 
        should be&quot; (p. 16). Again, at p. 69, he urges that the essential character 
        of species is that they constitute a discontinuous series, and he asks--&quot;Is 
        it not then possible that the Discontinuity of Species may be a consequence 
        and expression of the Discontinuity of Variation?&quot; He then states, that 
        on the received hypothesis, &quot;Variation is continuous, and the Discontinuity 
        of Species results from the operation of Selection.&quot; This, however, is 
        not quite a correct statement of the received hypothesis if &quot;discontinuous&quot; 
        is used in Mr. Bateson's sense, as including every change of colour which 
        is not by minute gradation, and every change in number of repetitive parts--as 
        of vertebr&aelig;, or of the joints of an antenna, or the rings of a worm--which 
        is not by a gradation of the part from a minute rudiment. Such changes 
        of colour or in the number of parts are admitted by all Darwinians as, 
        in many cases, constituting a part of that individual variation on which 
        modification of species depends. It is, however, on the supposed rejection 
        of this class of variations by Darwinians that he bases what he terms 
        &quot;an almost fatal objection&quot; to their theory.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning, however, to the supposed overwhelming 
        importance of discontinuous variation, we pass on to the last chapter 
        of the book, headed &quot;Concluding Reflexions,&quot; and we read: &quot;The first object 
        of this work is not to set forth in the present a doctrine, or to advertise 
        a solution of the problem of Species,&quot; and then follows immediately a 
        further discussion of this very theory of discontinuity, which <em>is</em> 
        set forth as a doctrine, and as a help to the solution of that problem. 
        We are told that the difficulties of the accepted view &quot;have oppressed 
        all who have thought upon these matters for themselves, and they have 
        caused some anxiety even to the faithful&quot;; it is urged that &quot;the Discontinuity 
        of which Species is an expression has its origin not in the environment, 
        nor in any phenomenon of Adaptation, but in the intrinsic nature of organisms 
        themselves, manifested in the original Discontinuity of Variation&quot;; that, 
        &quot;the existence of sudden and discontinuous Variation, that is to say, 
        of new forms having from their first beginning more or less of the kind 
        of <em>perfection</em> that we associate with normality, is a fact that 
        disposes, once and for all, of the attempt to interpret all perfection 
        and definiteness of form as the work of Selection.&quot; And then comes the 
        positive statement--&quot;The existence of Discontinuity in Variation is therefore 
        a final proof that the accepted hypothesis is inadequate&quot; (p. 568), and 
        after several more pages of illustration and argument, the final conclusion 
        is <font color="#990000">[[p. 218]]</font> reached that--&quot;it is quite 
        certain that the distinctness and Discontinuity of many characters is 
        in some unknown way a part of their nature, and is not directly dependent 
        upon Natural Selection at all.&quot;</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before going further it will be well to make a few 
        observations on these very definite and positive conclusions at which 
        Mr. Bateson has arrived; and it must be remembered that this volume deals 
        only with one portion of the subject even of discontinuous variation, 
        which is itself, if we exclude monstrosities, only a small fragment of 
        the whole subject of variation. The impression that will be produced on 
        those who have given special attention to the relations of living organisms 
        to each other and to their inorganic environment, will be that of an academic 
        discussion, dealing to a large extent with words rather than with the 
        actual facts of nature. The author's main point, that species form a discontinuous 
        series, and that specific differences cannot therefore have been produced 
        by any action of the environment, because that environment is continuous--an 
        argument which, as we have seen, he dwells upon and reiterates with emphasis 
        and persistency--rests wholly upon the obvious fallacies that in each 
        single locality the environment of every species found there is the same, 
        and that all change of environment, whether in space or time, is continuous. 
        To take this latter point first, nothing can be more abrupt than the change 
        often due to diversity of soil, a sharp line dividing a pine or heather-clad 
        moor from calcareous hills; or to differences of level, as from a marshy 
        plain to dry uplands; or, for aquatic animals, from the open sea to an 
        estuary, or from a non-tidal stream to an isolated pond. And when, in 
        the course of geological time, an island is separated from a continent, 
        or volcanic outbursts build up oceanic islands, the immigrants which reach 
        such islands undergo a change of environment which is in a high degree 
        discontinuous.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more important, perhaps, is the fact that, everywhere, 
        the environment as a whole is made up of an unlimited number of sub-environments, 
        each of which alone, or nearly alone, affects a single species, as familiarly 
        included in the term, &quot;their conditions of existence.&quot; The mole and the 
        hedgehog may live together in the same general environment, yet their 
        actual environments are very different owing to their different kinds 
        of food, habits, and enemies. The same thing applies to the rabbit and 
        the hare, the rook and the crow, the ring-snake and the viper; and still 
        more when we look at animals of greater diversity, as the otter and the 
        badger, the dung-beetle and the cockchafer, and a hundred others that 
        might be quoted. Now, though all these creatures may be found together 
        in the same area, each of them has its own &quot;environment,&quot; to which it 
        must be adapted in order to maintain its existence. Many species, however, 
        live, as it were, on the borders of two distinct <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        219]]</font> environments, as when they obtain different kinds of food 
        at different periods, being then exposed to different enemies and varied 
        climatic effects. In such cases, it is easy to see that a small modification 
        of structure might enable them advantageously to change their habits, 
        and thus obtain what would be practically a different environment. This 
        is well seen in those closely allied species which have somewhat different 
        modes of life--as the meadow pipit (<em>Anthus pratensis</em>) and the 
        tree pipit (<em>Anthus arboreus</em>)--the former having a long, nearly 
        straight claw to the hind toe, a more slender bill, and a rather greener 
        tinge of colouring, all modifications suited to its different habits and 
        distinct physical surroundings. Here we have an example in nature of how 
        environments, even when continuous as a whole, may become quite discontinuous 
        in relation to two species differing in very slight characters. Darwin 
        dwelt much upon this phenomenon, of new species being formed when any 
        body of individuals seized upon vacant places in the economy of nature, 
        and by means of comparatively slight variations became adapted to it. 
        It is what we see everywhere in the world around us.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It thus appears that what is evidently supposed to 
        be a very powerful argument leading to the conclusion that discontinuous 
        variations as a class are those which are of vital, if not exclusive importance 
        in the production of new species, entirely breaks down when confronted 
        with the facts of nature. It does not, however, follow that, because an 
        unsound <em>&agrave; priori</em> argument has been used to call attention 
        to these variations, and because they have been set before the world in 
        a way to suggest that their importance in relation to the origin of species 
        is a new discovery calculated to revolutionise the study of this branch 
        of biology, they are, therefore, of no value in this connection. We will, 
        therefore, now proceed to consider them on their own merits as possible 
        factors in the process of organic evolution. For this purpose we must 
        briefly indicate the nature of the variations so laboriously recorded 
        in this volume.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These consist of what are termed meristic variations, 
        that is, variations in the number or position of parts which occur in 
        series, whether linear, bilateral, or radial. Such are the variation in 
        the number of segments of annulosa and arthropoda, such as worms, leeches, 
        centipedes, &amp;c.; in the antenn&aelig; and legs of insects; in the 
        vertebr&aelig;, ribs, teeth, nipples, limbs, and toes of vertebrates; 
        in the rays of starfish, encrinites, and allied animals. The ocelli and 
        other symmetrical markings on the wings of butterflies are also recorded, 
        as well as numerous malformations when these affect serial or symmetrical 
        organs.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On carefully looking through the cases of variation 
        in this volume we are struck with the large proportion of them which exhibit 
        more or less deformation or want of symmetry, culminating in the various 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 220]]</font> kinds of monstrosity. In Chapter 
        III., on the variations of vertebr&aelig; and ribs, we find vertebr&aelig; 
        imperfectly divided in snakes and frogs. Numerous cases of abnormalities 
        in human vertebr&aelig; are given, usually exhibiting asymmetry or deformation, 
        and similar variations are found in the anthropoid apes, but here there 
        is apparently more of regularity and symmetry. The greatest amount of 
        this kind of variation occurs in the sloths, as might be expected when 
        we consider that they are the most abnormal of mammals as regards the 
        cervical vertebr&aelig;. In Chapter VIII. numerous cases of supernumerary 
        mamm&aelig; are recorded, almost all of which are unsymmetrical. The variations 
        in the number or form of the horns in sheep, goats, and deer recorded 
        in Chapter XI. show them to be usually more or less irregular.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly a hundred pages are devoted to the digits 
        (fingers and toes) of mammals and birds, about one hundred and forty cases 
        of variation being recorded. Almost the whole of these present, more or 
        less, want of symmetry, while a large proportion, as the double-handed 
        and double-footed children, and the six or seven-toed cats, can only be 
        classed as monstrosities.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In succeeding chapters the variations in the antenn&aelig; 
        and leg-joints of insects; in the radial parts of medus&aelig; and encrinites; 
        in the medial structures of fish, insects, molluscs, &amp;c., which become 
        sometimes double; in the eyes and colouration of flatfish; in duplicate 
        or branching legs of insects and crustaceans; in extra limbs of batrachia; 
        and, lastly, double monsters, are all discussed at great length, and are 
        illustrated by a number of very interesting wood-cuts. But almost the 
        whole of these can only be classed as malformations or monstrosities which 
        are entirely without any direct bearing on the problem of the &quot;origin 
        of species.&quot;</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing can better show the small value of the book 
        from this, which is the author's own, point of view, than the large amount 
        of space devoted to the various monstrosities of the hands and feet of 
        man and of some of the mammalia. Not only throughout all mammals, but 
        also in the case of birds, reptiles, and amphibia, five is the maximum 
        number of the toes or fingers. These may vary in size or in proportions, 
        they may be reduced in number by coalescence, or by the loss of the lateral 
        digits; they may be strangely modified in form and function, as in the 
        flappers of the whale, or in the wing of the hat, yet never once in the 
        whole long series of land-vertebrates do they exceed five in number. Yet 
        we have six, seven, or eight-fingered, double-handed, or double-footed 
        children; similar malformations in monkeys; six and seven-toed cats; four, 
        five, or six-toed pigs; double-footed birds, and other monstrosities, 
        described at great length, and all their peculiarities discussed in the 
        most minute detail and from various points of view, in a work presented 
        to us as <font color="#990000">[[p. 221]]</font> &quot;a contribution to the 
        study of the problem of species.&quot; Many of these malformations have been 
        observed among animals in a state of nature, and in fact, Mr. Bateson 
        believes that they occur as frequently among wild as among domesticated 
        animals. Considering how rarely the former cases can be observed, they 
        must be everywhere occurring; yet in no one single instance do they seem 
        to have established themselves as a race or local variety on however small 
        a scale. Yet we know that in the case of the six-toed cats, and probably 
        in other cases, they are easily transmissible; and we must, therefore, 
        conclude that all these irregularities and monstrosities are in a high 
        degree disadvantageous, since when subject to free competition with the 
        normal form in a state of nature they <em>never</em> survive, even for 
        a few generations.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the volume we are discussing is entirely devoted 
        to variations in the number or position of the serial parts of organisms 
        in relation to the origin of species, it becomes necessary to lay some 
        stress upon the very familiar, but apparently overlooked fact, that, among 
        all the higher types of life at all events, the most stable of all characters, 
        and the most permanent during long periods of evolution, and throughout 
        changes which have led to the production of a marvellous variety and abundance 
        of specific forms, are these very characters of the <em>number</em> and 
        relative positions of serial organs; whence it follows that variations 
        of this kind can only have led to specific changes at enormously long 
        intervals, and that, as a general rule, they can have had nothing whatever 
        to do with the origin of an overwhelming majority of living species.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have the four limbs of vertebrates, which 
        among all the marvellous variety of form and function, on land, in the 
        water, or in the air, is never exceeded, and appears to have been fixed 
        at a very early stage of the development of the vertebrate type. Equally 
        fixed, and extending through a still vaster range of modifications of 
        specific forms, are the six legs and four wings of true insects, which, 
        as in vertebrates, may be reduced but never increased in number. Still 
        more extraordinary, because less obviously connected with the main structure 
        and functions of the organism, is the limitation and permanence in the 
        number of the subdivisions of limbs and other appendages. There is no 
        obvious reason why in land-vertebrates the divisions of the hand and foot 
        should never exceed five, yet, not only is this number the maximum, but 
        it may be considered the normal number of which all others are reductions, 
        since it still prevails largely in the marsupials, rodents, carnivores, 
        primates, and lizards; and the five-toed land-vertebrates (excluding birds) 
        are probably far more numerous than those with a lesser number.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In birds there are only four toes as a maximum, and 
        comparatively few have a smaller number. But we have here a peculiarity 
        in the <font color="#990000">[[p. 222]]</font> numbers of the toe-joints 
        which does not occur in any other vertebrates. These form a series in 
        arithmetical progression, the hind toe having two, and the others three, 
        four, and five joints in regular order; and this rule is very nearly universal, 
        the only exceptions being in some of the swifts and goatsuckers, whose 
        habits render the feet of comparatively little importance, while their 
        general organisation is of a somewhat low type.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming to insects, we again find the legs consisting 
        of a limited number of parts, and, strangely enough, this number is again 
        five--the coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, and tarsus. The tarsus, however, 
        is subdivided into small movable joints, and these, too, are five as a 
        maximum, but in certain groups are reduced to four, three, or two. The 
        five-jointed tarsus is, however, the most prevalent; and in the enormous 
        order of coleoptera or beetles, comprising at least one hundred thousand 
        described species, fully half belong to families which have the tarsi 
        five-jointed. Even the antenn&aelig;, although they vary greatly in the 
        number of joints, yet in numerous large groups comprising many thousands 
        of species, they have the number of joints constant. Another indication 
        of the tendency of serial parts to become fixed in number, is the typical 
        limitation of the cervical or neck vertebr&aelig; of mammalia to seven 
        joints. This number is wonderfully constant, being the same in the long 
        necks of the giraffe and camel, and the very short necks of the hippopotamus, 
        porpoise, and mole, the only exceptions in the whole class being some 
        of the sloths, which have from six to ten, often varying in the same species, 
        and the manatee, which has six.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if we consider the enormous extent of these 
        fixed numerical relations of important parts of the organism in the higher 
        vertebrates and in insects, both as regards the number of living species 
        affected--perhaps ninety-nine per cent. of the whole--and as regards their 
        range in time, throughout the whole of the tertiary and secondary, and 
        even a considerable portion of the pal&aelig;ozoic periods--and if we 
        take account of the vast number of extinct species, genera, and families 
        needful to complete the various lines of descent from the earliest known 
        forms, presenting the same numerical relations to those now living--we 
        shall be able to form some conception, however inadequate, of the overwhelming 
        frequency and importance of variations in the size, form, proportions, 
        and structure of the various parts and organs of the higher animals, as 
        compared with variations in their number. No doubt, in the earlier stages 
        of organic development, numerical variations were more frequent and more 
        important, as they are now among the lower forms of life; but at a very 
        early period in geological history, the main numerical relations of the 
        essential parts of the higher organisms became more or less fixed and 
        stable, and have in many cases remained unchanged through a large <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        223]]</font> proportion of the period comprised in the geological record. 
        The four limbs of vertebrates were already established in the fishes of 
        the Devonian period, as were the four wings and six legs of true insects 
        in the cockroaches and archaic orthoptera of the Carboniferous; and almost 
        all subsequent changes have resulted from modifications of these early 
        types. The earliest mammals of which we have sufficient knowledge have 
        the typical five-toed feet, and the earliest birds appear to have had 
        the same progressive series of toe-joints as now prevails.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are thus irresistibly led to the conclusion that, 
        among all the possible forms of variation now occurring, those affecting 
        the <em>number</em> of important serial parts among higher organisms, 
        are those which have the least possible relation to whatever modification 
        of species may <em>now</em> be going on around us, or which has been going 
        on during a large portion of geological time. Yet it is to variations 
        of this nature, a large proportion of which are mere malformations or 
        monstrosities, that the bulky and learned volume we are discussing has 
        been devoted. The author of this book puts forward these malformations 
        and irregularities, mixed up with a proportion of normal variations, under 
        the misleading name of &quot;Discontinuous Variations,&quot; as if they were something 
        new, and had been ignorantly overlooked by Darwin and his followers; and 
        he loses no opportunity of telling us how important he thinks they are, 
        what difficulties they enable us to overcome, and how they are the beginnings 
        of the establishment of a sure base for the attack on the problems of 
        evolution. In so doing he has entirely failed to grasp the essential features 
        which characterise at least ninety-nine per cent. of existing species, 
        which are, slight differences from their allies in size, form, proportions, 
        or colour of the various parts or organs, with corresponding differences 
        of function and habits, combined with a wonderful amount of stability 
        in the numerical relations of serial parts, extending sometimes only to 
        genera, but more usually to families, tribes, orders, or even to whole 
        classes of the higher animals. It is differences of the former kind that 
        do actually characterise the great majority of species;<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
        they affect those organs which vary most frequently and most conspicuously 
        in the individuals of every fresh generation; and they constitute that 
        individual variation on which Darwin always relied as the essential foundation 
        of natural selection, and which his followers have shown to be far more 
        abundant and of far greater amount than he was aware of; and, lastly, 
        they afford amply sufficient material for the continuous production of 
        new forms. Rarely <font color="#990000">[[p. 224]]</font> in the history 
        of scientific progress has so large a claim been made, and been presented 
        to the world with so much confidence in its being an epoch-making discovery, 
        as Mr. Bateson's idea of discontinuous variation corresponding to and 
        explaining the discontinuity of species: yet more rarely has the alleged 
        discovery been supported by facts which, though interesting in themselves, 
        are for the most part quite outside the general conditions of the complex 
        problem to be solved, and are therefore entirely worthless as an aid to 
        its solution.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving this part of the subject we may note 
        the extension of definite numerical relations to plants as well as to 
        animals. In dicotyledons we have a typical five-petalled flower or a corolla 
        with five divisions, a character which prevails in irregular as well as 
        in regular flowers, and often when the stamens are not a multiple of five, 
        as in mallows, bignonias, and many others. Some form of five-parted flower 
        prevails throughout many extensive natural orders, and comprises probably 
        a considerable majority of all dicotyledonous plants. A three or six-parted 
        flower is almost equally a characteristic of monocotyledons, prevailing 
        even among the highly specialised and fantastically formed Orchide&aelig; 
        and Iride&aelig;, thus again demonstrating how large a portion of the 
        specific modifications of organisms are independent of variations in <em>number</em>, 
        but depend wholly upon variations in the size, form, colour, and structure 
        of the various parts and organs.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other matters of importance in Mr. Bateson's work, 
        together with some theories recently advanced by Mr. Francis Galton, will 
        be discussed in the concluding portion of this article.</p>
      <p align="center"><br /><font color="#990000">[[p. 435]]</font>&nbsp; II.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first part of this article the misconception 
        which underlies the main body of Mr. Bateson's work has been discussed 
        in some detail. We will now deal with some of the minor objections to 
        the views of most Darwinians which are to be found in his lengthy Introduction; 
        after which the validity of Mr. Francis Galton's doctrine, as to positions 
        of organic stability (also held by Mr. Bateson), will be considered. And 
        first, we note that he uses the usual misleading terms &quot;minute,&quot; &quot;minimal,&quot; 
        &quot;imperceptible,&quot; and &quot;insensible&quot; (p. 15) as applied to the individual 
        variations on which Darwin relied, although he has himself given figures 
        of beetles and earwigs showing that such variations are enormous--greater, 
        indeed, than in the illustrative cases I have given in my <em>Darwinism</em>.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong attack is made on the theory of the utility 
        of specific characters. It is admitted that an enormous amount of evidence 
        has been collected, and that &quot;the functions of many problematical organs 
        have been conjectured, in some cases perhaps rightly&quot;--yet he adds, &quot;whole 
        groups of common phenomena are still almost untouched even by conjecture.&quot; 
        He tells us that &quot;many suggestions have been made as to the benefits which 
        edible moths may derive from their protective colouration; and as to the 
        reasons why unpalatable butterflies in general are brightly coloured&quot; 
        (p. 11)--but neither here nor elsewhere is any hint given that more than 
        &quot;suggestions&quot; have been advanced. Considering that this is the one branch 
        of the subject in which natural selection has been shown to be an actual 
        working reality in nature by the experiments of Jenner Weir, Butler, Stainton, 
        and Belt, the observations of Bates and Fritz M&uuml;ller, and especially 
        by the elaborate investigations of Professor Poulton, it was hardly fair 
        to pass the subject by as if nothing had been done but pure conjecture. 
        He also ignores the continuous advance that is being made in determining 
        the utilities of the innumerable modifications in the forms and arrangement 
        of the leaves and other of the non-floral appendages of plants by Kerner, 
        Lubbock, and many other observers; as well as the light thrown on colour 
        and marking as specific characters in the higher animals by the consideration 
        of the value of <em>distinctiveness</em> for purposes of recognition, 
        a character of life-preserving value in the case of many animals, and 
        in all of great importance to reproduction, and an <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        436]]</font> essential factor in the differentiation of species. It is, 
        therefore, not correct to say, &quot;But as to the particular benefit which 
        one dull moth enjoys as the result of his own particular pattern of dulness 
        as compared with the closely similar pattern of the next species, no suggestion 
        is made.&quot; The suggestion <em>has</em> been made (<em>Darwinism</em>, p. 
        226), and has been accepted as at all events a good working hypothesis 
        by many naturalists. On this question of the utility of characters which 
        are constant characteristics of the species, but whose utility is not 
        apparent to the casual observer, Mr. Bateson uses very strong language. 
        Referring to the case of two ladybirds, the small <em>Coccinella</em> 
        <em>decempunctata</em> being exceedingly variable, both in colour and 
        spotting, the larger, <em>C</em>. <em>septempunctata</em>, very constant, 
        he says, &quot;To be asked to believe that the colour of <em>C</em>. <em>septempunctata</em> 
        is constant because it matters to the species, and that the colour of 
        <em>C</em>. <em>decempunctata</em> is variable because it does not matter, 
        is to be asked to abrogate reason&quot; (p. 572). I fear that I myself must 
        be in this sad case, for though I have not been asked to believe this 
        unreasonable thing, yet I do believe it! Of course I may be wrong and 
        Mr. Bateson right, but how is it that he is so absolutely sure that he 
        is right?</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before proceeding further we may briefly notice that 
        Mr. Bateson seems to imply that the &quot;meristic,&quot; or numerical variations, 
        to which he has devoted his volume, are altogether ignored by Darwinians 
        in their adoption of &quot;individual variations&quot; as opposed to &quot;sports&quot; for 
        the main materials on which natural selection works. But this is altogether 
        erroneous. No doubt they would reject nine-tenths of Mr. Bateson's cases 
        as being simply monstrosities, which neither have nor could ever have 
        had any part in the production of new species; but they always recognise 
        that genera, and even species are sometimes characterised by a difference 
        in the number or arrangement of serial parts--as of vertebr&aelig;, ribs, 
        teeth, or markings, and that therefore variations of this kind are sometimes, 
        though comparatively very rarely, the material on which natural selection 
        works. As development seems almost always to have proceeded by reduction 
        from large and indefinite numbers of serial parts to the minimum number 
        compatible with the maximum of utility, an increase in number occurring 
        now may be, as is usually considered, a form of reversion, though Mr. 
        Bateson denies that there is any such thing in nature. This diminution 
        in number may have occurred either by a gradual diminution in size and 
        ultimate disappearance, as when limbs of the higher animals have been 
        lost, in whales, the apteryx, snakes, &amp;c.; or it may sometimes have 
        been abrupt, which means that the rudiment of the part ceased to develop 
        at an early embryonic stage. Either mode is quite in harmony with the 
        views of Darwinians, and not very much seems to be gained by terming the 
        former <font color="#990000">[[p. 437]]</font> &quot;continuous&quot; and the latter 
        &quot;discontinuous,&quot; especially when this last term is held to include almost 
        every kind of monstrosity.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider an equally important, though, 
        as I consider, an equally unsubstantial novelty--the view that there are 
        &quot;definite positions of organic stability,&quot; which alone are sufficient 
        to mould races &quot;without any help whatever&quot; from natural selection. This 
        view appears to have originated with Mr. Francis Galton, and was first 
        stated in his work on &quot;Natural Inheritance,&quot; and again in his Royal Society 
        paper on &quot;Thumb and Finger Marks.&quot; The same view is adopted by Mr. Bateson; 
        and in an article on &quot;Discontinuity in Evolution&quot; in <em>Mind</em> (vol. 
        iii., pp. 362, 372) Mr. Galton approves of Mr. Bateson's work, and restates 
        his latest views on the subject, and these I now propose to consider.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Mr. Galton begins by the consideration of 
        <em>races</em> only, that is, of well-marked forms below the value of 
        species, yet later on he applies his theory to the evolution of species 
        and of all higher groups. Speaking of discontinuous or, as he terms it, 
        transilient variation, he says: &quot;A leap has taken place into a new position 
        of stability. I am unable to conceive the possibility of evolutionary 
        progress except by transiliences, for, if they were mere divergences, 
        each subsequent generation would tend to regress backwards towards the 
        typical centre, and the advance which has been made would be temporary 
        and could not be maintained&quot; (<em>l.</em> <em>c</em>., p. 368). Mr. Galton 
        has before implicitly admitted that there is such a thing as natural selection, 
        yet in this passage he reasons as if it had no existence, and that regression 
        to mediocrity would occur just the same with it as without it. For the 
        essence of natural selection is that it preserves and thus increases favourable 
        variations by destroying the unfavourable; but this statement by no means 
        expresses the real power of selection, which may be better illustrated 
        by saying that it destroys about ninety-nine per cent. of the bad and 
        less beneficial variations, and preserves about the one per cent. of those 
        which are extremely favourable. With such an amount of selection how can 
        there be any possible &quot;regression backwards towards the typical centre&quot; 
        when any change in the environment demands an advance in some special 
        direction beyond it as the only means of preserving the race from extinction? 
        Well did Darwin say that unless the universal struggle for existence &quot;be 
        thoroughly ingrained in the mind, the whole economy of nature, with every 
        fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation will 
        be dimly seen or quite misunderstood.&quot; Almost all the misconceptions of 
        popular writers against Darwinism arise from the want of this constantly 
        present recollection; and as capable and instructed writers, such as Mr. 
        Galton and Mr. Bateson, as well as capable but uninstructed writers such 
        as Lord Salisbury, alike suffer <font color="#990000">[[p. 438]]</font> 
        in this respect, it is needful to again state obvious facts which may 
        serve to drive home the overwhelming importance of this factor in evolution.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us suppose an animal which lives ten years and 
        produces ten young (five pairs) each year, a moderate allowance even for 
        many mammals and birds. A little simple arithmetic will show that if none 
        died for five years there would be 6,480 pairs in place of the one pair, 
        or 6,480 millions in place of one million, as the case might be. But it 
        is evident that such an average rate of increase for <em>all</em> animals 
        could not go on for even one or two years, as no country could supply 
        them with food. We will suppose, then, that only <em>one</em> pair, instead 
        of five, survive each year to breed the next year; but if this goes on 
        for the ten years of the life of the first pair we shall still have 512 
        pairs instead of each pair, a number which is equally impossible. Let 
        us, then, suppose that only one-fiftieth part of those born survive, that 
        is, that only one individual lives to breed out of five successive broods 
        of ten each; even then, at the end of ten years, we shall have a population 
        two and a half times as great as at first, or, more exactly, if we began 
        with a million individuals, then in ten years we should have 2,593,743. 
        This is probably something like what happens. Forty-nine fiftieths of 
        those born never live to breed, yet the population increases steadily 
        so long as conditions are moderately favourable, the surplus being got 
        rid of at uncertain intervals by recurrent unfavourable conditions, so 
        as to keep the number of individuals on the average about stationary. 
        Looking at it in another way, we find that, beginning with 100 individuals 
        whose offsprings each year amount to 500, of which only 10 survive to 
        breed, then during ten years about 8,000 will have been born, making with 
        the original hundred, 8,100, out of which only the 100 fittest, or nearly 
        the fittest, will survive, to be again weeded out every successive ten 
        years, or thereabouts. Without making some numerical estimate of this 
        kind it is impossible to realise the severity, of the struggle continually 
        going on in nature and the resultant elimination of the unfit. With the 
        above figures (which would have to be enormously greater with many species) 
        we see that for every 80 born only 1 on the average survives to breed. 
        With such an amount of selection it is evident that whenever it happened 
        that the mean point, or &quot;typical centre&quot; of the curve of variation, ceased 
        to be the most advantageous point in relation to the whole conditions 
        of existence, then a new typical centre would rapidly be produced by the 
        elimination of all which diverged from it to any injurious extent. There 
        could not possibly be regression from the new typical centre unless the 
        inevitable survival of the fittest in a rapidly increasing population 
        can be got rid of.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now in a position to discuss Mr. Galton's 
        theory, that there <font color="#990000">[[p. 439]]</font> are certain 
        variations which possess &quot;organic stability,&quot; and that these are the real 
        factors of evolution &quot;without any help whatever from the process of selection.&quot; 
        And first, what is the exact character of these stable variations, which 
        form <em>races</em> and ultimately new species by their own inherent force 
        of stability? Is the stability in relation to the actual conditions of 
        the environment or altogether independent of those conditions? If the 
        former, how did it come to be in harmony with them? If this harmonious 
        relation depends upon a mere chance coincidence, we have to consider the 
        comparative rarity of these large or discontinuous variations, and that 
        only a small proportion of them have the alleged character of &quot;stability.&quot; 
        Moreover this class of variations is generally a variation in a single 
        part or organ, and Herbert Spencer (as well as many other writers) has 
        argued forcibly that modifications of single characters would in all cases 
        be useless unless accompanied by the correlative modifications of a number 
        of other characters. I have myself shown that in the case of individual 
        variations this is no difficulty, because <em>all</em> characters are 
        varying more or less in every generation, and thus the needful harmonious 
        relation between the different organs or parts can be easily maintained; 
        but in the case of these large and rare variations the difficulty is an 
        overwhelming one. And we must always remember that these alleged &quot;stable&quot; 
        variations, from the first moment of their appearance, cannot possibly 
        escape from the action of natural selection. As, roughly speaking, only 
        about one per cent. of each generation survives to breed, this new form, 
        however stable in itself, cannot become part of that one per cent. unless 
        the particular variation which characterises it is either beneficial or 
        entirely harmless. But in the latter case it is difficult to see what 
        constitutes its superiority over the rest of the species which, year by 
        year, by means of this intensely severe process of elimination, is kept 
        in harmony with the environment. If the stability consists in greater 
        health, vigour, reproductive power, or intelligence, all these qualities 
        have already been developed to the fullest needful extent, and these superior 
        individuals will be selected in the usual way. But if--as a second alternative--these 
        alleged stable variations are supposed to have some kind of inherent stability 
        independent of the environment, then, stability notwithstanding, they 
        would inevitably soon succumb under the terrible eliminating power which 
        year by year leaves only about one per cent. of the most fit to survive. 
        There is really no escape from this dilemma: If your new variety <em>is</em> 
        among the one or two per cent. of the most fit, then it does not need 
        this purely imaginary quality of &quot;organic stability&quot; in order to survive; 
        if it is <em>not</em> among this small body of the most fit--that is, 
        of the best adapted to the whole conditions of existence of the species 
        or race--then, any other quality notwithstanding, it will certainly <em>not</em> 
        survive. <font color="#990000">[[p. 440]]</font> The term &quot;organic stability&quot; 
        has really no meaning except that of harmonious adaptation to the environment 
        as tested and maintained by natural selection. To talk about new races 
        or species being produced &quot;without any help whatever from natural selection&quot; 
        can, under the actual conditions of the terrestrial universe, only mean 
        that there is an inherent developmental power which modifies organisms 
        in definite ways, and in more perfect harmony with the environment than 
        has been, or can be, brought about by natural selection, thus keeping 
        these modified organisms always ahead of the rest. They may thus be said 
        to be independent of survival of the fittest, because they and their offspring 
        always <em>are</em> the most fit, and therefore always survive! On this 
        theory evolution goes on by the production of new races complete and ready 
        formed, and in perfect harmony with the environment whenever that environment 
        undergoes a change. But no evidence is offered for such an extraordinary 
        developmental power being always at work and always able to produce adaptation 
        to an ever-changing environment. Such a power would be hardly different 
        from the old special creation, or than the pre-ordained harmony of the 
        philosophers; and it would, moreover, have rendered unnecessary and unintelligible 
        that rapid multiplication, and consequent enormous expenditure of life, 
        which now prevails. It would equally render unnecessary that wonderful 
        property of individual variability, whose only use would then be to enable 
        man to improve his domestic animals and cultivated plants. We should thus 
        have two rival systems at work, and we might almost imagine Mr. Sullivan's 
        cosmic spirits--William and James--to be realities, and that each had 
        been experimenting in organic development on our earth in order to see 
        whose scheme was the most satisfactory.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As evidence of the actual existence of this hypothetical 
        &quot;organic stability,&quot; Mr. Galton adduces the patterns in thumb and finger-marks, 
        which he has so carefully studied. In his Royal Society paper on this 
        subject, he tells us that these marks fall into definite groups and can 
        be systematically classified, and he actually describes and figures twenty-five 
        distinctive patterns arranged under three very distinct classes. He then 
        urges that these fundamentally distinct classes are strikingly analogous 
        to genera in biology, and as the patterns are so insignificant in every 
        way that they can in themselves be neither useful nor ornamental, and 
        can therefore never have been the subjects of selection, they prove, he 
        thinks, &quot;that natural selection has no monopoly of influence in forming 
        genera, but that it could be wholly dispensed with, the internal conditions 
        acting by themselves being amply sufficient to form them.&quot; And it is from 
        the case of these finger-marks that he <font color="#990000">[[p. 441]]</font> 
        considers the reality of positions of organic stability has been proved, 
        and that they are &quot;competent to mould races without any help whatever 
        from the process of selection.&quot;</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first sight this may appear to be sound reasoning, 
        and to be fatal to some of the claims of the Darwinians, but further examination 
        will show that it is a pure fallacy arising from the vague use of terms, 
        and from comparing quite different things as if they were of the same 
        nature. The fallacy depends on applying the terms of classification in 
        systematic biology to groups of single objects which have no real relation 
        with the genera and species of the naturalist. The essential character 
        of a species in biology is, that it is a group of living organisms, separated 
        from all other such groups by a set of distinctive characters, having 
        relations to the environment not identical with those of any other group 
        of organisms, and having the power of continuously reproducing its like. 
        Genera are merely assemblages of a number of these species which have 
        a closer resemblance to each other in certain important and often prominent 
        characters than they have to any other species. It will be more intelligible 
        and more instructive if we confine ourselves to species as the unit of 
        comparison with Mr. Galton's groups of stable finger-patterns, in order 
        to show the fundamental differences between them. And first we see that 
        Mr. Galton classifies the marks themselves, not the individuals who possess 
        the marks. He tells us that the very same general varieties in these marks 
        are found in English, Hindoos, and Negroes, and, presumably in all other 
        races; and, further, that he has &quot;failed to observe any correlation between 
        the patterns and any single personal quality, whether mental or physical.&quot; 
        All this is entirely different from either specific or generic characters, 
        whose <em>essential</em> feature is that they are found in every normal 
        individual of the genus or species, and are <em>always</em> correlated 
        with other characters. In his first paper on this subject (in 1890), Mr. 
        Galton said he had reason to believe that the patterns are to some extent 
        hereditary, but that he had no evidence of it; while in his paper on <em>Mind</em> 
        four years later, he could still only say that &quot;they are to be looked 
        upon&quot; as having &quot;a slight tendency towards transmission by inheritance.&quot; 
        But the very essence of specific and generic characters is, that they 
        are strictly transmitted by inheritance. Yet again, whatever difference 
        of opinion there may be as to the utility of <em>all</em> the characters 
        which distinguish species, every one will admit that <em>many</em> are 
        useful, and especially that the general assemblage of characters that 
        fit each species for a somewhat different mode of life from its nearest 
        allies, must certainly be useful. But the very essence of Mr. Galton's 
        argument as to these finger-prints is, that they are not and cannot be 
        in any way directly useful. How, then, can the manner in which <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        442]]</font> these patterns may be grouped, furnish us with any argument 
        whatever as regards such totally diverse things as generic or specific 
        characters--and still less as regards genera and species themselves?</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is, no doubt, that these patterns are the 
        direct result of the laws of growth of the tissues of the skin. The limited 
        number and definite character of these patterns are probably the mechanical 
        incidental results of these laws, under the ever-varying conditions of 
        development in each individual. A good analogy would be found in snow-crystals, 
        of which about a thousand varieties have been recorded, which may, however, 
        all be grouped under five classes, while each snow-fall usually produces 
        crystals of one class. Here we have the fixed and definite laws of the 
        crystallisation of water, so modified by conditions of moisture, temperature, 
        motion, and perhaps electric state of the atmosphere, as to lead to this 
        wonderful variety of the product, yet always subject to the law of crystalline 
        symmetry and to systematic grouping under definite classes; just as in 
        these finger-prints we have a more limited variety of forms, which also 
        can be grouped under a few classes. But neither the one nor the other 
        has any real bearing upon the problem of the nature and origin of the 
        genera and species of living organisms. A study of the distribution of 
        the stars over the surface of the heavens, or of the interlacing ripple-marks 
        upon the sea-beach, would no doubt show that these objects might also 
        be the subject of classification; and from the point of view of elucidating 
        the origin of species, they would be about as useful, or as worthless, 
        as the study of finger-marks.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are many varieties or races, both 
        among animals and plants, which continually reappear, and which in some 
        cases are known to reproduce their like, and these undoubtedly have an 
        appearance of stability. Such are the light and dark-coloured varieties 
        in many insects and in some mammals and birds; the hairy or smooth varieties 
        of plants; specially banded or coloured land-shells, and many others. 
        Whenever any of these variations are not injurious under the actual conditions 
        of existence of the species, they may persist in considerable numbers, 
        and thus appear to be stable. But others which are comparatively rare 
        may be just as stable organically, as shown by the case of white mice, 
        pigeons, &amp;c., which increase to any extent under domestication. In 
        a wild state they never do so, and the obvious reason is, that either 
        the conspicuous colour, or something correlated with it, is injurious. 
        In flowers white varieties are frequent, and they occur in all degrees 
        of abundance or rarity; and this indicates, in all probability, various 
        degrees of hurtfulness. If in any case the white colour were not at all 
        injurious as compared with that of the type, it would almost always, by 
        the operation of Delb&#156;uf's Law, tend to increase to nearly an equality 
        with the parent form; and as this equality so rarely <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        443]] </font>occurs, we must conclude that, in most cases, the variety 
        (of whatever kind) <em>is</em> to some extent injurious.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> 
        From the usually limited number of individuals presenting these discontinuous 
        variations, we may therefore draw an important conclusion which has hitherto 
        been overlooked. It is, that not only do such variations afford no support 
        to the theory of a special &quot;organic stability&quot; capable of producing races, 
        species, and even genera, without any aid from natural selection, but 
        they furnish a strong, if not conclusive, argument against it, since any 
        which did possess such exceptional stability, and were in no degree injurious, 
        would long since have become equal in numbers to the type of the species.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few words are here necessary as to the very common 
        misconception that extreme Darwinians do not recognise the importance 
        of the organism itself and of its laws of growth and development, in the 
        process of evolution. For myself, I may say that no one can be more profoundly 
        impressed by the vast range, by the complexity, by the mystery, by the 
        marvellous power of the laws and properties of organised matter, which 
        constitute the very foundation of all life, and which alone render possible 
        its countless manifestations in the animal and vegetable worlds; while 
        those who have read Weissmann's account of the complex processes of development 
        of sperm and germ cells, in his volume on <em>The Germ Plasm</em>, must 
        feel sure that he, at all events, can have no inadequate conception of 
        their importance.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Darwinians deny is--as I understand the question--that 
        these laws themselves serve to keep the completed organism in close adaptation 
        to the fluctuating environment, instead of merely furnishing the material 
        which is required for that adaptation. In our view, the fundamental laws 
        of growth and development, through the agency of rapid multiplication 
        and constant variability, provide the material on which natural selection 
        acts, and by means of which it is enabled to keep up the adaptation to 
        the environment (which alone renders continuous life and reproduction 
        possible) during the constant, <font color="#990000">[[p. 444]]</font> 
        though slow changes, whether inorganic or organic, by which, in the course 
        of ages, the effective environment of each species becomes more or less 
        profoundly modified. Thus, and thus alone, we believe, are new species 
        produced in strict adaptation to the new environment. So far as rendering 
        possible and actually leading to growth, reproduction, and variation, 
        the fundamental laws are supreme. In securing the development of new forms 
        in adaptation to the new environment, natural selection is supreme. Hence 
        arises the real distinction--though we may not always be able to distinguish 
        them--between specific and non-specific or developmental characters. The 
        former are those definite, though slight modifications, through which 
        each new species actually became adapted to its changed environment. They 
        are, therefore, in their very nature, useful. The latter are due to the 
        laws which determine the growth and development of the organism, and therefore 
        they rarely coincide exactly with the limits of a species. The more important 
        of these latter characters are common to much larger groups, as families, 
        orders, or classes, while others, depending partly on complex and fluctuating 
        influences, are variable even within the limits of a species. Of this 
        kind are the finger-prints, which, like many other minute details of form 
        or structure, vary from individual to individual.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have now, I think, shown that the two most recent 
        efforts to establish new methods of organic evolution, as either complete 
        or partial substitutes for natural selection--that is, for the survival 
        of the fittest among the individual variations annually produced--have 
        completely failed to establish themselves as having any relation to the 
        actual facts of nature. Mr. Bateson's discontinuous variations were long 
        ago rejected by Darwin as having no important part in the formation of 
        new species, while recent and ever-growing proofs of the generality and 
        the magnitude of individual variability, render these larger and rarer 
        kinds of variation of even less importance than in his time. Mr. Galton's 
        theory of organic stability, which is essential to the success of discontinuous 
        variations, has been shown to be founded upon a comparison of things of 
        a totally dissimilar nature, and, further, to be absolutely unintelligible 
        and powerless unless in strict subordination to natural selection.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why two writers of such extensive knowledge 
        and undoubted ability have so completely failed in dealing with the great 
        problem of the modification of organic forms, has been clearly indicated 
        during the course of this discussion. It has arisen from the fact that 
        they have devoted themselves too exclusively to one set of factors, while 
        overlooking others which are both more general and more fundamental. These 
        are, the enormously rapid multiplication of all organisms during more 
        favourable periods, and the <font color="#990000">[[p. 445]]</font> consequent 
        weeding out of all but the fittest in what must be on the whole stationary 
        populations. And, acting in combination with this <em>annual</em> destruction 
        of the less fit, is the <em>periodical</em> elimination under recurrent 
        unfavourable conditions, of such a large proportion of each species as 
        to leave only a small fraction--the very elect of the elect--to continue 
        the race. It is only by keeping the tremendous severity of this inevitable 
        and never-ceasing process of selection always present to our minds, and 
        applying it in detail to each suggested new factor in the process of evolution, 
        that we shall be able to determine what part such factors can take in 
        the production of new species. It is because they have not done this, 
        that the two authors, whose works have been here examined, have so completely 
        failed to make any real advance towards a more complete solution of the 
        problem of the Origin of Species than has been reached by Darwin and his 
        successors.</p>

        demonstration of Delb&#156;uf's Law, see <em>Habit and</em> <em>Intelligence</em>, 
        by J. J. Murphy, 2nd Ed., p. 241. Briefly, the law is that, if a species 
        produces a variety, in however small a proportion annually, and if the 
        variety produces its like in the same proportion as does the species, 
        and if it is neither beneficial nor hurtful to the species, then the variety 
        will increase, rapidly at first and more slowly afterwards, till it approaches 
        to equality in numbers with the species. From this law it follows that, 
        as varieties are usually very much less numerous than the species, this 
        must be due to one of the following causes: either (1) the variety has 
        but recently originated, and has not had time to increase; or (2) the 
        variety has ceased to be produced by the species; or (3) it does not reproduce 
        its like so completely as does the species; or (4) it is disadvantageous 
        to the species. The first two suppositions are improbable, and can only 
        account for a very small proportion of the varieties which are greatly 
        inferior in numbers to the species; the other two are antagonistic to 
        any special &quot;organic stability,&quot; which must, therefore, in the great majority 
        of cases he rejected as being both unproven and also opposed to the facts.

For grades 3-12<p>

Create a model of a neuron by using clay, playdough, styrofoam,
recyclables, food or anything else you can get your hands on.  Use
pictures from books to give you an idea of where the components of a 
neuron should go and what shape they should be.  Use different colors to 
indicate different structures.  Make a neural circuit with a few of the 
neurons.  Create sensory or motor systems.  Eat your model if you made it 
out of food!!<P>

Need some play dough but don't have any?  Here is a recipe that you can
use to make your own:<p>
 
Mix:   1 cup flour, 1/2 cup salt  & 2 teaspoon cream of tartar<br>
Add:   1 cup cold water with food coloring, 1 Tablespoon salad oil<p>
Cook over a low heat, stirring constantly until it thickens.  Let it cool
a bit and then knead it.  Keep in an airtight container so it doesn't dry
out.<p>

You can also add color to the play dough by adding some poster paint with
the liquid instead of food coloring.  Try to use as little paint as
possible to get the desired color or it will make the play dough sticky.

This giant model of a neuron illustrates the properties of <a href = 
"synapse.html">chemical transmission</A> and the <a href = 
"ap.html"> action potential</A>.  You must construct the neuron before you 
use it with a group of people.

Cut two to three foot lengths of rope to use as dendrites.  Another 10-15
foot piece of rope will be turned into the axon.  The cell body and
synaptic terminal of the neuron can be plastic containers.  Drill holes in
the plastic containers for the dendrites and axon.  To secure the
dendrites and axon in place, tie a knot in the ropes so they will not slip
through the holes of the containers.  The action potential is modeled with
a pool float.  Thread the pool float onto the axon before you secure the
axon in place.  Place small plastic balls or ping-pong balls in the
synaptic terminal and your model is ready to go!<P>

Set up the model:<P>

<ol><LI>Get volunteers to hold each of the dendrites.
<LI>Get one volunteer to hold the cell body and one to hold the synaptic 
terminal.  Make sure the person holding the synaptic terminal keeps his or 
her hands AWAY from the place the axon attaches (more about this later).
<LI>Get one volunteer who will hold more molecules of neurotransmitter 
(more plastic balls) near the people who are dendrites.
<li>Get one volunteer to hold the action potential.</ol><P>

<center><img src = "./gif/neuronap.gif" width="341" 
height="158"></center><P>

Use the model:<P>

<ol><LI>Have the person holding molecules of neurotransmitter TOSS the
plastic balls to the people who are dendrites.  The "dendrite people" try
to catch the plastic balls.  This models the release of neurotransmitters
and the attachment (binding) of neurotransmitters to receptors on
dendrites.<P>

<li>When three plastic balls are caught by dendrites, the person holding 
the action potential can throw/slide the pool float down the axon.  This 
simulates the depolarization of the neuron above its threshold value and 
the generation of an action potential.<P>

<LI>The action potential (pool float) should speed down the axon toward
the synaptic terminal where it will slam into the container.  This should
cause the release of the neurotransmitters (plastic balls) that were being
held there.<br>  
<img src="caution.gif"> <font color=red>CAUTION:</font> The pool float 
will travel
very fast!  Make sure that the person holding the synaptic terminal keeps
his or her fingers and hands AWAY from the pool float.</ol><P>

If the entire model is stretched tightly, the pool float should travel  
down to the terminal smoothly.  This model can be used to reinforce 
the "ALL-OR-NONE" concept of the action potential:
<ul><LI>Once the action potential starts, it continues without 
interruption.
<LI>The size of the action potential stays the same as it travels down the 
axon.</uL><P>

temperature, pour it into small plastic bags.  Add fruits (canned fruit
cocktail works well) and candies to the Jell-O to represent the organelles
you would find inside of a neuron.  For example, mandarin orange slices
could be mitochondria; a cherry half could be the nucleus; red and black
string licorice could be microtubules and neurofilaments. The plastic bag
can represent the cell membrane.  Don't forget ribosomes, the golgi

your cell so you remember which food represents which organelle.  Write
your legend on some card stock or index card.  After all the "organelles"
have been added, tie off the top of the bag with a twist tie and place the

For grades 3-12<p>

Display your brain on a "Thinking Cap."  Thinking Caps are 
created from papier (or paper) mache.  <p>

<u>Create the Form</u>: First, create the brain form for the cap.  You can
create a form from wire (e.g., chicken wire) or a balloon or use a bowl to
build your cap around.  You could even ball up some newspaper and cover it
will masking tape.  The form should have the approximate size and shape of
your head so you can wear it.  <p>

<u>Create the Structure</u>:  Cut strips of newspaper and glue them to the
form using papier mache paste.  Pastes can be made from:<p>

<ul>
<li>White glue and water (about 2 parts glue to 1 part water)
<li>White flour, salt and water (about 1 part flour to 1 part water with 
a few tablespoons of salt)
<li>Liquid starch
</ul>

Coat the newspaper strips with the paste, and place them on the form.  
Let each newspaper layer dry before you add a new layer.  Add enough 
layers to give you a strong structure.  When the structure is dry, remove 
the underlying form.  You may have to cut the edges of the structure and 
repair the sides for a good fit on your head.  <p>

<u>Decorate the Thinking Cap</u>:  you can paint the Thinking Cap with the

$16.95 each (Catalog #MF-95-2849A) .  Coat each side of the rubber mold
with liquid hand soap.  Mix up FAST set dental plaster (also available
from CBS) with water to the consistency of toothpaste. Pour the dental
plaster into each side of the mold.  Sandwich the mold together and wait
about 15-20 minutes.  Tap the mold a few times to get out all the air
bubbles.  It can get a bit messy.  When the plaster has set and is hard,
peel back one side of the mold and remove the brain. You can add food
coloring to the plaster while you are mixing the plaster if you want a
brain with a bit of color or you can paint the different parts of the
brain with different colors.<p>

Your right hand should have a small vial of liquid or some other item,

Each person should be about arms length away from the next person. When

the signal transmission by placing his or her "neurotransmitter" into the
hand of the adjacent person.  Once this message is received, this second
neuron places its neurotransmitter into the dendrite of the next neuron.  
The third neuron then places its neurotransmitter into the dendrites of

Grades 3-12<p>

<a href = "salt.html">Saltatory
conduction</a> is a way that myelinated axons transmit action potentials. 
Action potentials jump from node to node.  To model this, have everyone
stand up and form a straight line. Each person should be at arms length of
the next person. Give the last person in line a small object like a ball
or an eraser.  This time, each person does NOT make up an individual
neuron.  This time, everyone together is a SINGLE neuron and each person
is a "myelinated section" of an axon.  The space between each person is a
node of Ranvier.  To start the axon potential, someone should say "go". 
The first person will slap the hand of the neighboring person, then that
person will slap the hand of the next person etc., etc.  Remember, in this
model, the line of people is just one <font size = +1> neuron.</font><p>

When the action potential gets to the last person holding the object,
have this person toss the object into the air. This represents the 
neurotransmitter (the object) floating out into the synaptic cleft (the 
air).<p>

You can also measure the time it takes the signal to move down the axon
using a stopwatch.  Measure the approximate distance the signal must
travel (the total distance of the all the people).  If you then divide the
distance by the time, you will get the speed (conduction velocity) of the
signal.  The conduction velocity of this model neuron will most likely be
much slower than in the fastest of real neurons (about 268 miles/hr).<P>

<tr><td><center><h1><u><img

Grades 4-12<br>
Game designed by Jessica Koch<p> 

<strong>Objective:</strong> Race to raise the resting potential above
threshold to fire an <a href="ap.html">action potential</a>.<p>

<strong>Background:</strong> When neurotransmitters cross a synapse, they
can bind with receptors on dendrites.  This binding can result in a change
in the electrical potential of a neuron.  An excitatory postsynaptic
potential occurs with the neuron becomes depolarized, raising the
electrical potential from its baseline of about -70 mV and bringing it
closer to threshold and increasing the chance that an action potential
will fire.  An inhibitory postsynaptic potential occurs when the
electrical potential is lowered, making it less likely an action potential
will be generated.  If the electrical potential is raised so that it
reaches the threshold, an action potential will fire down the axon of a
neuron.</p>

<strong>How to Play: </strong> Players should be divided into two teams:
the Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) Team and the Inhibitory
Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP)  Team.  The teams will race to see who can
get the greatest signal to their team's cell body in 30 seconds. Each team
lines up to act like a dendrite.  A signal, (a small ball), is passed from
person to person much like how an electrical signal travels down a
dendrite toward the cell body.  Each EPSP team signal successfully
transferred to the cell body is worth +5 or +10 mV (millivolts); each IPSP
Team signal is worth -5 or -10 mV.  The signals are passed down the
dendrites until they reach the end and are tossed into the cell body
container. Only one signal ball can be passed at a time meaning that a
dendrite must drop the ball (signal) into the cell body container before
the first person in the dendrite can pass the next ball (signal). <p>

<strong>To Win:</strong> The typical resting potential of a neuron is -70
mV. To cause an action potential the membrane potential must reach -55 mV.
Therefore at the end of 30 seconds the signals are summed from the cell 
body container. The total amount of millivolts is added to -70 mV to see if an
action potential is fired. If an action potential is fired the EPSP team
wins! If not then the IPSP team wins!<p>

these functions is to protect the brain from sudden impacts.  To

Egghead is a raw egg with drawn-on face.  The inside of the egg represents
the brain and the egg shell represents the pia mater (the inner most layer

<p>

Put Mr. Egghead in a container (tupperwear works fine) that is a bit
larger than the egg.  The container represents the skull.  Now put a tight
top on the container and shake it.  You should observe that shaking the
"brain" (the egg) in this situation results in "damage" (a broken egg).<p>

Now repeat this experiment with a new Mr. Egghead, except this time, fill
the container with water.  The water represents the cerebrospinal
fluid.  Note that shaking the container does not cause the "brain damage"
as before because the fluid has cushioned the brain from injury.<P>

You could make this into a science fair project:  test the hypothesis that
"The cerebrospinal fluid and skull protect the brain from impact injury." 
Drop Mr. Egghead from a standard height (or heights) in different
conditions:  1) with fluid in the container, 2) without fluid in the

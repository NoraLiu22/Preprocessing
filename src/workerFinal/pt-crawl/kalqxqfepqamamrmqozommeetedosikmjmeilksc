<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The history of Botswana does much more than cover a gap between
the histories of neighbouring South Africa and Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Angola, and Zambia. In <a href="bhp3.htm">prehistoric</a> and <a
href="bhp10.htm">very recent times</a> the <a href="bhp14.htm">
Kalahari</a> thirstlands of Botswana have been central in the
historical <a href="bhp7.htm">geography</a> of the region, as the
intermediate territory between the savannas of the north and east
and the steppes of the south and west.</p>

<p>Between the 1880s and its independence in the 1960s, however,
Botswana was a poor and peripheral British protectorate known as
Bechuanaland. The country is named after its dominant <a href=
"bhp4.htm">ethnic group</a>, the Tswana or Batswana ('Bechuana' in
older variant orthography), and the national <a href="bhp8.htm">
language</a> is called Setswana (aka 'Sechuana').</p>

<p>Since the later 1960s Botswana has gained in international
stature as a peaceful and increasingly prosperous <a href=
"bhp10.htm">democratic state</a>. It has had one of the fastest
growing <a href="bhp5.htm">economies</a> in the world, rising from
one of the poorest to lower-middle income level. This new
prosperity has been based on the mining of diamonds and other
minerals, which have built up state revenues, and on the sale of
beef to Europe and the world market. There has been extensive
development of <a href="bhp6.htm">educational</a> and health
facilities, in villages and traditional rural towns as well as in
rapidly growing new towns. But there has also been an increasing
gap between classes of <a href="bhp13.htm">new rich and new
poor</a>.</p>


<HR>
<P CLASS="backto"><A name="EARLY-HUNTING,-PASTORAL,-AND-FARMING-PEOPLE-" HREF="#contents">Back to contents</A>  || <A HREF="#doc_top">Back to top</A></P>
<h2>Early Hunting, Pastoral, and Farming People</h2>

<p>Khoesan-speaking hunters and herders,P eople speaking <a href=
"bhp8.htm">Khoesan (Khoe and San) languages</a>, have lived in
Botswana for many thousands of years. A site in the Tsodilo hills
(Depression Shelter), in the north-western corner of Botswana,
contains <a href="bhp3.htm">archaeological</a> evidence of
continuous Khoesan occupation from about 17 000 BC. to about 1650
AD.</p>

<p>For most of that period Khoesan people subsisted as hunters and
gatherers, their tools made of stone (and wood and bone), with a
culture characterized by archaeologists as 'Later Stone Age'. Their
hunting and gathering lifestyle was adapted to seasonal mobility in
family groups over grassland and scrub, in and around the extensive
riverine lakes and wetlands that once covered the north of the
country and were dotted elsewhere.</p>

<p>During the last centuries BC many Khoe-speaking people in
northern Botswana converted their lifestyle to pastoralism -
herding cattle and sheep on the rich pastures exposed by the
retreating wetlands of the <a href="bhp14.htm">Okavango delta</a>
and Makgadikgadi lakes. Cattle and sheep had been brought from East
Africa, where they had previously been herded by other Later Stone
Age people for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Some Khoe pastoralists migrated with their livestock through
central Namibia as far south as they could, to the Cape of Good
Hope, by about 70BC. They took Khoe language to areas where only
San languages had previously been spoken.</p>

<h3>Bantu-speaking farmers</h3>

<p>Both farming of grain crops and the speaking of Bantu languages
were carried southwards from north of the Equator over the course
of millennia. From West Africa, Later Stone Age farming reached
through Angola, and had been converted to the use of iron tools on
the upper Zambezi by around 380 BC. From East Africa, Early Iron
Age farming spread down the savanna to the Zambezi by around 20
B.C., as well as along the east coast. The farmers brought with
them the speaking of western and eastern <a href="bhp8.htm">Bantu
languages</a>.</p>

<p>It took hundreds of years for Iron Age farming culture and Bantu
languages to replace Khoe pastoral culture in the
Okavango-Makgadikgadi area. As early as 200 BC people there were
making a kind of pottery known as Bambatha ware, which
archaeologists think was Khoe pottery influenced by (western) Iron
Age styles. Khoe language was being spoken by pastoralists in the
area, on the Boteti River, as late as the 19th century, within
recent living memory.</p>

<p>The earliest dated Iron Age site in Botswana is an iron smelting
furnace in the Tswapong hills near Palapye, dated around 190 AD -
probably associated with eastern Iron Age Bantu farming culture
from the Limpopo valley. Meanwhile farming culture of the western
Iron Age type spread through northern and into south-eastern
Botswana. The remains of beehive-shaped small houses made of
grass-matting, occupied by western Early Iron Age farmers, have
been dated from about 420 AD around Molepolole, and a similar site
in the western Transvaal near Pretoria has been dated as early as
300. There is also evidence of early farming settlement of a
similar type in Botswana west of the Okavango delta, existing
alongside Khoesan hunter and pastoralist sites in the <a href=
"bhp14.htm">Tsodilo hills</a>, dated from around 550 AD.
Archaeologists now have difficulty in interpreting the hundreds of
<a href="bhp3.htm">rock paintings</a> in the Tsodilo hills, which
were once assumed to be painted by 'Bushman' hunters remote from
all pastoralist and farmer contact.</p>

<HR>
<P CLASS="backto"><A name="Eastern-Botswana-chiefdoms-" HREF="#contents">Back to contents</A>  || <A HREF="#doc_top">Back to top</A></P>
<h3>Eastern Botswana chiefdoms</h3>

<p>From around 1095 south-eastern Botswana saw the rise of a new
culture, characterized by a site on Moritsane hill near Gabane,
whose pottery mixed the old western style with new Iron Age
influences derived from the eastern Transvaal (Lydenburg culture).
The Moritsane culture is historically associated with the <a href=
"bhp8.htm">Khalagari (Kgalagadi)</a> chiefdoms, the westernmost
dialect-group of Sotho (or Sotho-Tswana) speakers, whose prowess
was in cattle raising and hunting rather than in farming.</p>

<p>In east-central Botswana, the area within 80 or 100 kilometres
of Serowe (but west of the railway line) saw a thriving farming
culture, dominated by rulers living on <a href="bhp3.htm">Toutswe
hill</a>, between about 600-700 and 1200-1300. The prosperity of
the state was based on cattle herding, with large corrals in the
capital town and in scores of smaller hill-top villages. (Ancient
cattleandsheep/goatcorrals are today revealed by characteristic
grassgrowing on them.) The Toutswe people were also hunting
westwards into the Kalahari and trading eastwards with the Limpopo.
East coast shells, used as trade currency, were already being
traded as far west as Tsodilo by 700.</p>

<p>The Toutswe state appears to have been conquered by its
Mapungubwe state neighbour, centred on a hill at the Limpopo-Shashe
confluence, between 1200 and 1300. Mapungubwe had been developing
since about 1050 because of its control of the early gold trade
coming down the Shashe, which was passed on for sale to sea traders
on the Indian Ocean. The site of Toutswe town was abandoned, but
the new rulers kept other settlements going - notably Bosutswe, a
hill-top town in the west, which supplied the state with hunting
products, caught by Khoean hunters, and with Khoesan cattle given
in trade or tribute from the Boteti River. But Mapungubwe's triumph
was short-lived, as it was superceded by the new state of Great
Zimbabwe, north of the Limpopo River, which flourished in control
of the gold trade from the 13th to the 15th centuries. It is not
known how far west the power of Great Zimbabwe extended. Certainly
its successor state, the Butua state based at Kame near Bulawayo in
western Zimbabwe from about 1450 onwards, controlled trade in salt
and hunting dogs from the eastern Makgadikgadi pans, around which
it built stone- walled command posts.</p>

<p>The Butua state passed from the control of Chibundule (Torwa)
rulers to Rozvi invaders from the north-east in about 1685. Under
Rozvi rule, the common people of Butua became known as the <a href=
"bhp8.htm">Kalanga</a>. The old Chibundule rulers appear to have
fled to the western Kalanga (in the area now in Botswana), where
they became known as Wumbe, giving rise to a number of local
Kalanga chiefdoms. Other Kalanga chiefdoms descended from Mengwe,
the 'uncle' of Chibundule, or from groups of Sotho attracted from
the south such as the Nswazwi and Chizwina (Sebina) chiefdoms.</p>

<h3>North-western Botswana chiefdoms</h3>

<p>From about 850 AD farmers from the upper Zambezi, ancestral to
the Mbukushu and Yeyi peoples, reached as far south and west as the
Tsodilo hills (Nqoma). Oral traditions tell of Yeyi farmers and
fishermen scattering among the Khoesan of the Okavango delta in the
early 18th century, like 'flies across a milk-pail'. The oral
traditions of <a href="bhp8.htm">Mbukushu</a> chiefs tell of
migrations from the upper Chobe down the Okavango river later in
the 18th century. These appear to have been responses to increased
raiding in Angola for the Atlantic slave trade. The oral traditions
of <a href="bhp8.htm">Herero and Mbanderu</a> pastoralists,
south-west of the Okavango straddling the Namibia border, relate
how they were split apart from their Mbandu parent stock by 17th
century Tswana cattle-raiding from the south.</p>

<P CLASS="backto"><A name="Rise-of--" HREF="#contents">Back to contents</A>  || <A HREF="#doc_top">Back to top</A></P>
<h3>Rise of <a href="bhp4.htm">Tswana domination</a></h3>

<p>During the 1200-1400 period a number of powerful dynasties began
to emerge among the Sotho in the western Transvaal, spreading their
power in all directions. Fokeng chiefdoms spread southwards over
Southern Sotho peoples, while Rolong chiefdoms spread westwards
over Khalagari peoples. Khalagari chiefdoms either accepted Rolong
rulers or moved westwards across the Kalahari, in search of better
hunting and the desirable large cattle of the west. By the 17th
century Rolong-Khalagari power stretched, as we have seen. as far
as Mbandu country across the central Namibia- Botswana frontier. In
the 1660's the military and trading power of the main Rolong
kingdom at Taung (south of Botswana), in conflict with Kora groups
of southern Khoi over copper trade, was known as far away as the
new Dutch settlers at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>The main <a href="bhp8.htm">Tswana</a> (Central Sotho) dynasties
of the Hurutshe, Kwena and Kgatla were derived from the Phofu
dynasty, which broke up in its western Transvaal home in the
1500-1600 period. Oral traditions usually explain these migrations
as responses to drought, with junior brothers breaking away to
become independent chiefs. The archeology of the Transvaal shows
that the farming population was expanding and spreading in small
homesteads, each clustered round its cattle corral, across open
countryside - with a few larger settlements as evidence of petty
chiefdoms. But after about 1700 the settlement pattern changed,
with stone-walled villages and some large towns developing on hills
- evidence of the growth of states often hostile to each other.
These states were probably competing for cattle wealth and subject
populations, for control of hunting and mineral tribute, and for
control of trade with the east coast.</p>

<h2>Growth of Tswana States</h2>

<p>Kwena and Hurutshe migrants founded the Ngwaketse chiefdom among
Khalagari-Rolong in south-eastern Botswana by 1700. After 1750 this
grew into a powerful military state controlling Kalahari hunting
and cattle raiding, and copper production west of Kanye. Meanwhile
other Kwena had settled around Molepolole; and a group of those
Kwena henceforth called Ngwato further north at Shoshong. By about
1770 a group of Ngwato, called the Tawana, had even settled as far
north-west as Lake Ngami, in country occupied by Yeyi and
previously frequented by Khalagari-Rolong and Kwena hunters and
traders.</p>

<h3>Times of war</h3>

<p>Southern Africa as a whole saw an increasing tempo of
disruption, migration and war from about 1750 onwards, as trading
and raiding for ivory, cattle and slaves spread inland from the
coasts of Mozambique, the Cape Colony and Angola. By 1800 raiders
from the Cape had begun to attack the Ngwaketse. By 1826 the
Ngwaketse were being attacked by the Kololo, an army of refugees
under the dynamic leadership of Sebetwane, who had been expelled
north- westwards, possibly by raiders from Maputo Bay. The great
Ngwaketse warrior king, Makaba II, was killed, but the Kololo were
pushed further north by a counter-attack.</p>

<p>The Kololo moved through Shoshong, expelling the Ngwato
northwards, to the Boteti River, where they settled for a number of
years - attacking the Tawana and raiding for cattle as far west as
Namibia, where they were warded off in a battle with Herero. In
about 1835 they settled on the Chobe River, from which the Kololo
state stretched northwards until its final defeat by its Lozi
subjects on the upper Zambezi in 1864. Meanwhile the Kololo were
followed in their tracks by the Ndebele, a raiding army led by
Mzilikazi, who settled in the Butua area of western Zimbabwe in
1838-40 after the conquest of the Rozvi. These wars are called the
<a href="../ac/mfec.htm">Difaqane</a> by historians.</p>

<h3>Post-war Tswana commercial prosperity</h3>

<p>The Tswana states of the Ngwaketse, Kwena, Ngwato and Ngwato
were reconstituted in the 1840s after the wars passed. The states
took firm control of commoners and subject peoples, organised in
wards under their own chiefs paying tribute to the king. The states
competed with each other to benefit from the increasing trade in
ivory and ostrich feathers being carried by waggons down new roads
to Cape Colony in the south. Those roads also brought <a href=
"bhp11.htm">Christian missionaries</a> to Botswana, and Boer
trekkers who settled in the Transvaal to the east of Botswana.</p>

<p>The most remarkable Tswana king of this period was Sechele
(ruled 1829-92) of the Kwena around Molepolole. He allied himself
with British traders and missionaries, and was baptized by David
Livingstone (see <a href="../links.htm">Links</a> for link to free
electronic text of his classic <i>Missionary Travels</i>). He also
fought with the Boers, who tried to seize Africans who fled to join
Sechele's state from the Transvaal. But by the later 1870's the
Kwena had lost control of trade to the Ngwato, under <a href=
"http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/k/Khama.shtml">Khama III</a> (ruled
1875-1923), whose power extended to the frontiers of the Tawana in
the north-west, the Lozi in the north and the Ndebele in the
north-east.</p>

<h2>A British Protectorate</h2>

<p>The Scramble for Africa in the 1880s resulted in the German
colony of South West Africa, which threatened to join across the
Kalahari with the independent Boer republic of the Transvaal. The
British in Cape Colony responded by using their missionary and
trade connections with the Tswana states to keep the <a href=
"bhp14d1.htm">"missionaries' road"</a> to Zimbabwe and the Zambezi
open for British expansion. In 1885 the British proclaimed a
protectorate over their Tswana allies, as far north as the Ngwato;
and the protectorate was extended to the Tawana and the Chobe River
in 1890.</p>


<HR>
<P CLASS="backto"><A name="Threats-of-incorporation-" HREF="#contents">Back to contents</A>  || <A HREF="#doc_top">Back to top</A></P>
<h3>Threats of incorporation</h3>

<p>British colonial expansion was privatized, in the form of the
British South Africa (BSA) Company, which used the road through the
Bechuanaland Protectorate to colonize Zimbabwe (soon to be called
Rhodesia) in 1890. But the protectorate itself remained under the
British crown, and white settlement remained restricted to a few
border areas, after an attempt to hand it over to the BSA Company
was foiled by the delegation of <a href=
"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/News/excerpts.html">three Tswana
kings to London in 1895</a>. The kings, however, had to concede to
the company the right to build a railway to Rhodesia through their
lands.</p>

<p>The British government continued to regard the protectorate as a
temporary expedient, until it could be handed over to Rhodesia or,
after 1910, to the new Union of South Africa. Hence the
administrative capital remained at Mafeking (Mafikeng), actually
outside the protectorate's borders in South Africa, from 1895 until
1964. Investment and administrative development within the
territory were kept to a minimum. It declined into a mere appendage
of South Africa, for which it provided migrant labour and the rail
transit route to Rhodesia. Short-lived attempts to reform
administration and to initiate mining and agricultural development
in the 1930s were hotly disputed by leading Tswana chiefs, on the
grounds that they would only enhance colonial control and white
settlement. The territory remained divided into eight largely
self-administering 'tribal' reserves, five white settler farm
blocks, and the remainder classified as crown (i.e. state)
lands.</p>

<p>The extent of Bechuanaland Protectorate's subordination to the
interests of South Africa was revealed in 1950. In a case that
caused political controversy in Britain and the Empire, the British
government barred Seretse Khama from the chieftainship of the
Ngwato and exiled him for six years. This, as secret documents have
since confirmed, was in order to satisfy the South African
government which objected to Seretse Khama's marriage to a white
woman at a time when racial segregation was being reinforced in
South Africa under apartheid.</p>


<HR>
<P CLASS="backto"><A name="ADVANCE-TO-INDEPENDENCE-" HREF="#contents">Back to contents</A>  || <A HREF="#doc_top">Back to top</A></P>
<h2>Advance to Independence</h2>

<p>From the later 1950s it became clear that Bechuanaland could no
longer be handed over to South Africa, and must be developed
towards political and economic self-sufficiency. The supporters of
Seretse Khama began to organize political movements from 1952
onwards, and there was a nationalist spirit even among older
'tribal' leaders. Ngwato 'tribal' negotiations for the start of
copper mining reached agreement in 1959. A legislative council was
eventually set up in 1961 after limited national elections. The
Bechuanaland People's Party (BPP) was founded in 1960, and the
Bechuanaland Democratic Party (later <a href="bhp10.htm">Botswana
Democratic Party</a>, BDP) - led by Seretse Khama - in 1962.</p>

<p>After long resistance to constitutional advance before economic
development could pay for it, the British began to push political
change in 1964. A new administrative capital was rapidly built at
Gaborone. Bechuanaland became self- governing in 1965, under an
elected BDP government under Seretse Khama as prime minister. In
1966 the country became the Republic of Botswana, with Seretse
Khama as its first president.</p>

<p>For its first five years of political independence, Botswana
remained financially dependent on Britain to cover the full cost of
administration and development. The planning and execution of
economic development took off in 1967-71 after the discovery of
diamonds at Orapa. The essential precondition of this was
renegotiation of the <a href="bhp5.htm">customs union</a> with
South Africa, so that state revenue would benefit from rising
capital imports and mineral exports - rather than remaining a fixed
percentage of total customs union income. This renegotiation was
achieved in 1969.</p>

<h2>BOTSWANA GAINS INTERNATIONAL STATURE</h2>

<p>From 1969 onwards Botswana began to play a more significant role
in international politics, putting itself forward as a non-racial,
liberal democratic alternative to South African apartheid.</p>

<p>South Africa was obliged to step down from its objections to
Botswana building a road, with US aid finance, direct to Zambia
avoiding the old railway and road route through Rhodesia. From 1974
Botswana was, together with Zambia and Tanzania, and joined by
Mozambique and Angola, one of the "Front Line States" seeking to
bring majority rule to Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.</p>

<h3>Economic and political growth</h3>
<p>With an economy growing annually between 12 and 13 percent,
Botswana extended basic infrastructure for mining development and
basic social services for its population. More diamond mines were
opened, on relatively favourable terms of income to the state, and
less economically successful nickel-copper mining commenced at
Selebi-Phikwe. The BDP was consistently re-elected with a large
majority, though the <a href="bhp10.htm">Botswana National
Front</a> (BNF, founded 1965) became a significant threat after
1969, when "tribal" conservatives joined the socialists in BNF
ranks attacking the "bourgeois" policies of government.</p>

<p>The later 1970s saw civil war in Rhodesia, and urban
insurrection in South Africa, from which refugees flowed into
Botswana. When Botswana began to form its own army, the Botswana
Defence Force, the Rhodesian army crossed the border and massacred
15 Botswana soldiers in a surprise attack at Leshoma (February
1978). Botswana played its part in the final settlement of the
Rhodesian war, resulting in Zimbabwe independence in 1980. But its
main contribution was in formulating the Southern African
Development Coordination Conference, to look to the future of the
region.</p>

<p>The idea behind SADCC, as expounded by Seretse Khama, was to
coordinate disparate economies rather than to create a unified
market in southern Africa. All the states of southern Africa,
except South Africa (and Namibia), formed SADCC in 1980, to work
together in developing identified sectors of their economies -
particularly the transport network to the ports of Mozambique.</p>

<h2>Masire succeeds Seretse Khama</h2>

<p>Seretse Khama died in July 1980 and was succeeded as president
by his deputy since 1965, vice-president Quett (aka Sir Ketumile)
Masire.</p>

<p>Between 1984 and 1990 Botswana suffered from upheavals in South
Africa when South African troops raided the 'Front Line States'.
Two raids on Gaborone by the South African army in 1985 and 1986
killed 15 civilians. A new era in regional relations began with the
independence of Namibia in 1990, and continued with internal
changes in South Africa culminating in its free elections of
1994.</p>

<p>The <a href="bhp5.htm">economy</a> continued to expand rapidly
after a temporary slump in diamond and beef exports at the
beginning of the 1980s. The expansion of mining output slowed in
the 1990s, but was compensated for by the growth of manufacturing
industry producing vehicles and foodstuffs for the South African
market.</p>

<h2>Mogae succeeds Masire</h2>

<p>In April 1998, Quett (Sir Ketumile) Masire retired as president,
and was succeeded by his vice-president <a href="bhp10.htm">Festus
Mogae</a>. Since then the main opposition party, the BNF, which had
begun to approach parity with the ruling BDP in the elections of
1994, has been split in half by a leadership dispute.</p>

<p>Botswana handed over leadership of SADCC, now the Southern
African Development Community(SADC), to South Africa in 1994. But
the secretariat of <a href="http://www.sadc-usa.net/">SADC</a>
remains housed in the capital of Botswana, Gaborone.</p>

<p>As well as SADC, the Republic of Botswana is a member of the
United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the
Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth. Botswana is also a
member (with Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland) of the
<a href="bhp5.htm">Southern African Customs Union</a> (SACU).</p>

      <p><font size="2"><strong><em>by Hendrik Broekman </em></strong></font></p>
      <p><img src="../images/boek_small.jpg" alt="Hendrik Broekman" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="10" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="94"><font size="2">Evidence for establishing pitch standards of the 18th century
      indicates that there was no single standard but that most musical performance in the
      baroque era took place at pitches lower than A-440 Hz.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Surviving harpsichords are one source from which evidence can be
      adduced. When we mount wire analogous to that used by the ancients on our close copies and
      pull it up only to find that it will break before it reaches modern pitch, we must think
      twice about what pitch we will use as a standard. Another result of pitching a keyboard
      instrument at A-440 Hz is a slight penalty in the structural longevity of the case due to
      excess stress (12%) imposed by the elevated pitch. Most importantly, we now realize that
      instruments sound richer and more sonorous when strung with lower tensile wire similar to
      that used by 18th century builders, and when pitched at A-415 Hz or A-392 Hz, one half
      tone or one whole tone below A-440 Hz.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The Transposing Keyboard provides a satisfactory compromise suited to
      20th century pitch standards, the modernized instruments with which the harpsichord must
      play, as well as the more severe physical environments which all centrally heated
      buildings impose. Transposition is accomplished by the simple device of sliding the
      keyboard sideways to operate a different selection of jacks. This permits the instrument
      to play at different pitches without the need for retuning every string.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Today most Hubbard custom built instruments and all Hubbard kits are
      designed to be used at A-415 Hz. Transposing keyboards are provided to accommodate use at
      modern pitch. Older Hubbard custom instruments can be retrofitted for the Transposing
      Keyboard. The cost is US$500. Hubbard kit builders interested in converting their
      instruments to transposers (single or double) are encouraged to write for instructions and
      parts. Parts required total US$125 for the single-manual kit and US$150 for the
      double-manual kit. Instruments from the mid-70's with front guided keyboards will require
      special instructions.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">For those players and technicians confronted with the Transposing
      Keyboard but unfamiliar with its use, the procedure listed below should be followed:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">All stops should be turned on so that the dampers help support the jacks
      as the key ends pass beneath them. With the manuals coupled, play each note in turn to
      insure that the jacks are supported by the dampers. The transposing shim should be tipped
      up and pulled out. Supporting the lower end blocks with fingers (especially thumbs) and
      being sure that the end keys are not depressed, slide the keyboards slowly to their new
      position. Do not force. If the keyboards resist, a jack is caught somewhere, usually in
      the lowest or topmost set. This requires that the jack rail be taken off and the jack
      freed by lifting it up. Replace the transposing shim in the other side. The instrument
      should be tuned to A-415 in low position. It should be transported with the action in low
      position (i.e., with the transposing shim at the treble end).</font></p>

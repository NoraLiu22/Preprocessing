    <p><font color="#004080">The sun was shining on Vienna, this Sunday morning in 1782. As
    the clock on the church tower was approaching 10:00, the 26-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus
    Mozart was briskly walking towards the Royal Library, to the residence of Baron van
    Swieten, the former representative of the court of Vienna in Berlin, now, the chief
    librarian. He was whistling a theme from the manuscript he held in one hand, a manuscript
    he had just finished a few minutes before. With his other hand, he was carrying his viola.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#004080">The small group of the most promising young musicians in Vienna,
    whom the Baron invited to his house every Sunday, had now arrived. Mozart placed one of
    his newly dried manuscript copies on each of the four wooden music stands placed in a
    semi-circle in front of the marble fireplace. The Baron sat down in his comfortable chair
    nearby. Mozart, with a twinkle in his eye, unpacked his viola, and he and three of the
    other young musicians sat down in front of the music stands.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#004080">Then, they started to play. But not all at once. First Mozart
    played, alone &#151; it was the theme he had been whistling. Then, the second violin
    entered, answering Mozart's viola with the same theme, but this time played a fifth
    higher. Meanwhile, Mozart continued, playing the last part of the theme again, but this
    time one note higher than before, which meant that the last note he played, a note not
    even found in this key, uncomfortably clashed with the note then being played by the
    second violin, before things settled down when his next note came.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#004080">After the end of the second violin's theme, Mozart and the second
    violinist continued playing a small duet, with each playing the second part of the theme
    even higher, until the first violinist raised his violin, and started playing the theme,
    this time, an octave above where Mozart had started. Simultaneously, Mozart's viola and
    the second violin continued playing variations of this fragment of the theme, which
    intertwined with the first violinist, and with each other, until, unexpectedly, even
    before the first violin had finished his theme (at the point where the second part of the
    theme started), the 'cellist took up the theme in deep resonant tones, while Mozart and
    the two violinists continued their intertwining themes. When the 'cellist played the last
    tone of the theme, the Baron smiled, and closed his eyes, listening intensely, and with
    great joy, to the development of the fugue.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#004080">Just before the end, each of the four played the same harmonious
    theme, but instead of simultaneously, overlapped in such a way that a tense musical storm
    ensued, before calm was reestablished.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#004080">When the last tones had evaporated into the air, leaving evidence
    of their having sounded only in the hearts and minds of the gathered musicians, the Baron
    said, &quot;Well Mozart, you have really brought the old Johann Sebastian back to life.
    And for that, I give you my deepest thanks.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#004080">It had been the Baron's idea. He had encouraged Mozart to
    transcribe three- and four-voice fugues from Johann Sebastian Bach's groundbreaking work
    for keyboard instrument, the <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier.<cf1> This, then, had been the first
    performance of Mozart's transcription of Bach's Fugue No. 5 in D Major, from Book II.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#004080">Baron van Swieten had scoured Berlin to find manuscripts of Bach
    and Händel, whose works were virtually unknown in Vienna, and had brought them back with
    him. He knew that it was by making their music come alive again, it was by learning from,
    and being inspired by their music, that he could help young musicians become good
    composers. He was convinced that it was through playing the greatest music of the past,
    that one could hope to create great music in the future.</font></p>

    <p>The reconstruction above, by this author, is based on some of the known facts
    surrounding Mozart's transcriptions of several three- and four-voice fugues from Johann
    Sebastian Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier.<cf1> Mozart transcribed them during the period around
    1782-83, when he attended Baron van Swieten's Sunday-morning musical salon, and while a
    phase-change in his compositional method was occurring. This change was provoked by his
    encounters with Bach's works, in combination with Joseph Haydn's revolutionary new string
    quartets (Op. 33), written the year before.</p>
    <p>To continue the year 2000 commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the death of Bach
    (1685-1750), and to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the publication of Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered
    Clavier,<cf1> this article concerning Mozart, and a projected future article on Robert and
    Clara Schumann, will present evidence of the degree to which these composers who lived
    after Bach, intensively studied and &quot;re-composed&quot; his works as pedagogical
    exercises, to deepen their knowledge of polyphony and counterpoint, and then directly made
    use of Bach's compositional method in composing new works. This evidence will be presented
    through the words of these composers, and through several of their musical works, not
    widely known today.</p>
    <h4>Mozart's Transcriptions of Bach</h4>
    <p>&quot;I go to the house of Baron Van Suiten [sic] every Sunday at 10 o'clock and
    nothing is played there but Händel and Bach. I am making a collection of Bach's fugues,
    those of Sebastian as well as Emanuel and Friedman [sic].&#151;Also of Händel's, and I
    don't have those. I expect that you know that the 'English Bach' is dead? What a loss to
    the musical world!&quot; Mozart wrote this to his father Leopold on April 10, 1782. In a
    letter to Leopold on Jan. 4, 1783, he writes that he is still going to Baron Van Swieten's
    every Sunday, and on Dec. 6, 1783, he begs his father to send him some Bach fugues from
    Salzburg.</p>
    <p>At Baron van Swieten's, the young musicians pour over the Bach and Händel manuscripts
    the Baron had brought back from Berlin, playing them for each other. (See section on
    &quot;The Musical Midwife,&quot; at the end of this article for more about Baron van
    Swieten.)</p>
    <p>Lyndon LaRouche has written about the revolutionary change provoked by Mozart's
    exposure to two of Bach's greatest works, <cf2>The Musical Offering<cf1> and <cf2>The Art of the Fugue,<cf1>
    at Baron van Swieten's musical salon.<sup>1</sup> Here, another aspect of his discovery of
    Bach is added, that of Mozart's encounter with Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier.<cf1> <img
    src="Bach.JPG" width="170" height="236" alt="Bach.JPG (14998 bytes)" align="left"
    border="1" hspace="8" vspace="4">At the Baron's suggestion, Mozart transcribed three
    three-voice fugues from Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier<cf1> for string trio,<sup>2</sup> plus
    Contrapunctus 8 from Bach's <cf2>Art of the Fugue,<cf1> with a prelude consisting of a movement from
    Bach's Organ Sonata No. 3 <sup>3</sup>; a prelude consisting of a movement from Bach's
    Organ Sonata No. 2,<sup>4</sup> followed by the fugal 3rd movement in C minor from the
    same sonata; and Fugue No. 8 by W.F. Bach. These six three-part preludes and fugues are
    known today as K. 404a.<sup>5</sup> Since the preludes that accompany each of Bach's
    fugues, were not well suited for string instruments, a special string trio prelude was
    composed for each one, generally considered written by Mozart. As David Shavin wrote in <cf2>Fidelio,<cf1>
    in these preludes, Mozart was &quot;addressing the developmental potentialities of the
    fugal material that would have occupied Bach's mind. Mozart, in presenting to the assembly
    his hypothesis as to how Bach's mind worked, fashioned a powerful tool to aid in his own
    development, and in the development of those around him.&quot;<sup>6</sup></p>
    <p>Mozart's authorship of these preludes has been debated, however, because a manuscript
    from Mozart's hand has never been found.<sup>7 </sup>The musicologist Julian Haylock wrote
    that these preludes &quot;demonstrated an unerring emotional kinship with the fugues with
    which they are coupled. These preludes can be studied in relation to Mozart's only other
    major work for string trio, the great Divertimento in E-flat major, K. 563, from 1788.</p>
    <p>In addition to the three-voice fugues, previously mentioned, Mozart transcribed five of
    Bach's four-voice fugues from the second book of the <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier,<cf1> known as K.
    405,<sup>8 </sup>and his manuscript exists. The significance of the four-voice fugues is
    that Mozart's study of Bach's treatment of four voices, could not but have revolutionized
    his thoughts concerning string-quartet writing.<sup>9</sup></p>
    <p>Mozart's transcriptions are not exact. There has been a debate about these differences,
    which some attribute to possible mistakes in the manuscript he was using, and others to
    changes Mozart thought were necessary for musical reasons. &quot;Even if Mozart copies,
    his creative fantasy plays and alters details, and each detail is worth notice,&quot;
    Einstein writes.</p>
    <p>Whereas Mozart's manuscript for the Bach four-voice fugues has no introductions, the
    Austrian National Library in Vienna has a series of unsigned manuscripts of six four-part
    fugues of J.S. Bach (including four of those included in Mozart's K. 405), and three of
    Bach's five-part fugues,<sup>10</sup> all with new introductions. The musicologist Warren
    Kirkendale writes that members of Baron van Swieten's circle most likely wrote these, and
    that Mozart possibly wrote all or some of them. Another musicologist, Raymond Mayland,
    believes that Mozart or Haydn may have been involved in their composition.</p>
    <p>Kirkendale concludes that the complete set of three-, four-, and five-part fugues
    originated from a manuscript that probably belonged to van Swieten.<sup>11</sup></p>
    <h4>Bach's 'Well-Tempered Clavier'</h4>
    <p>Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier<cf1> was a revolutionary work. It has been referred to as the
    &quot;Old Testament&quot; of Classical piano music. (The New Testament being Beethoven's
    piano sonatas.) Finished in 1722, the full title was, &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier, or
    preludes and fugues in all the tones and semitones, both with the major third or 'Ut, Re,
    Mi' and with the minor third or 'Re, Mi, Fa.' For the use and profit of young musicians
    who are anxious to learn, as well as for the amusement of those who are already expert in
    the art.&quot; This later became known as Book&nbsp;I of the <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier<cf1> (BWV
    846-869), and contained 24 preludes and fugues, one for each of the major and minor keys.
    A second book, <cf2>Twenty-four New Preludes and Fugues<cf1>, which repeated the procedure with 24
    new compositions, was written between 1740-44 (BWV 870-93).</p>
    <p><img src="welltemp.JPG" width="227" height="369" alt="welltemp.JPG (26383 bytes)"
    align="left" hspace="8" border="1" vspace="2">Bach used this work to explore, in depth,
    the new musical possibilities that arose as a result of the development of a new system of
    tuning keyboard instruments, called well-tempering, which could give these fixed-note
    instruments increased ability to play multi-voiced, or polyphonic music, as if there were
    different species of human voices singing together, with similar flexibility and irony.</p>
    <p>In 1691, the German organist and mathematician Andreas Werckmeister (1645-1706)
    published a treatise entitled, &quot;Musical Temperament or ... mathematical instruction
    how to produce ... a well-tempered intonation on the clavier.&quot; Bach, Werckmeister,
    and others who supported the well-tempered system, rejected the previously held idea that
    musical intervals in the physical universe, had to conform to abstract mathematical
    proportions. This idea had put a straitjacket on the musical universe, limiting it to only
    those keys in which &quot;pure&quot; intervals could be played.</p>
    <p>The new movement, of which Bach was a leader, created systems in which it would be
    possible to play music in all keys. The &quot;comma&quot; (the part of the octave that is
    left over if only mathematically &quot;pure&quot; musical intervals are used) was
    distributed unequally throughout all of the keys. (Different keys had different-sized
    intervals, giving each key its own nuance or &quot;color,&quot; creating a &quot;musical
    palette,&quot; which is lost in the modern practice of &quot;equal-tempering,&quot; where
    all half-notes have the same value.) It were then possible both to write music in every
    key, and to modulate&#151;to move from one key to any another&#151;within the same piece
    of music, in a way not possible before.</p>
    <p>The musical universe was liberated from a system centered in the key-in-itself, or its
    closest neighbors, to being a system that was expanded to encompass all of the major and
    minor keys. In addition, Bach's use of the Lydian interval, previously banned, and other
    lawfully created dissonances, served as a musical transcendental bridge, to allow musical
    development to supercede even the 24-key system.<sup>12</sup></p>
    <p>Musical action was transformed from being limited to change within a few keys, to
    becoming action based on the unlimited development of musical ideas throughout the entire
    &quot;24-key-plus&quot; musical universe, where musical development takes advantage of
    explicit and implicit relations between a whole range of different keys; where the
    possibilities to create musical change, transformation, paradox, and development are
    increased to the maximum.</p>
    <p>&quot;As any listener to a Bach composition can easily recognize, the position of any
    note, is an ambiguity, that becomes less ambiguous, as the composition unfolds, and the
    intervals so generated, and their inversions, are heard with respect to the well-tempered
    system of <cf2>bel canto<cf1> polyphony as a whole. It is the change, with respect to the whole
    well-tempered system, that determines the notes, not the notes that determine the
    change.&quot;<sup> 13</sup></p>
    <p>Just before Bach, other composers had experimented with writing single pieces which
    modulated throughout all the keys, or with writing different pieces for all 24 keys.<sup>14
    </sup>But Bach's musical genius surpassed them. Bach-family biographer, Karl Geiringer,
    writes that Bach realized that the new system could revolutionize the method of fugal
    composition. Before, change was only possible by introducing new musical subjects or
    &quot;counter-subjects,&quot; or variations of the theme. Now, change was possible by
    writing developmental sections, called episodes, which would transport the theme from one
    key to another, with the establishment of the new key being solidified by the theme being
    announced in the new key. A greater &quot;oneness&quot; existed than ever before, because
    the material for the episodes was taken directly from the main theme, or the theme's
    counterpoint.<sup>15</sup></p>
    <p>Bach continued to develop his fugal compositional method, later creating such
    masterpieces of creativity as the <cf2>Musical Offering,<cf1> and the <cf2>Art of the Fugue.<cf1></p>
    <h4>The Importance of Studying Fugues</h4>
    <p>&quot;This volume of fugues <em>The Well-Tempered Clavier</em><cf1> was always lying open on
    Mozart's pianoforte,&quot; recalled Mozart's pupil Thomas Attwood.</p>
    <p>In the process of writing the transcriptions for stringed instruments of Bach's three-
    and four-voice fugues from the <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier<cf1>, Mozart had to separate out each of
    the voices, and regard them as individual, sovereign voices, in and of themselves, and see
    how they formed a unity with each other through musical dialogue. By doing so, Mozart
    gained greater insight into Bach's method of composition, akin to &quot;reliving&quot; his
    creative thought processes.</p>
    <p>Recall my reconstruction of a morning session at Baron van Swieten's above. In a fugue,
    each voice enters by playing the theme, or a slight variation of the theme, and then
    paradoxically proceeds to unfold its voice in an independent manner, yet in dialogue with
    the other voices. Through studying Bach's fugues, Mozart could study Bach's method of
    composing several equally important, independent voices, which were created to be played
    together to form a beautiful whole.</p>
    <p>Music that has more than one voice is called &quot;polyphony&quot; &#151; from the
    Greek for &quot;many voices.&quot; The art of combining the many voices in a beautiful
    manner is called &quot;counterpoint,&quot; from &quot;point against point.&quot; This
    refers to the art of composing a second voice, to be played together with a given first
    voice. (Setting one &quot;point,&quot; or note, of a second voice, to one
    &quot;point,&quot; or note of a given first voice.) For example, adding one, or more,
    counterpoint voice(s), to a well-known Psalm melody.</p>
    <p>When writing counterpoint, the composer strives to enable each voice to be a coherent,
    melodic voice, in and of itself. However, through natural development of each of the
    voices, including the use of the inversion of musical intervals or themes, they come into
    conflict with each other, creating what are called dissonances, or musical intervals that
    are uncomfortable, which create tension, and demand to be resolved. This creates an
    impetus for paradox, surprise, development, and change in the music. The art of
    counterpoint developed over centuries, and reached its highest point with Bach's music<sup>.16</sup></p>
    <p>Posterity was given an insight into Bach's ability to see the development potential of
    a given theme, from the following story told by one of Bach's sons. Bach's son was sitting
    next to him at a concert where a fugue was being performed. Just after the first
    presentation of the theme, Bach whispered to his son, predicting exactly which fugal
    techniques the composer would use to develop the theme. When, as predicted, the music
    developed exactly as Bach said it would, he nudged his son and said the equivalent of,
    &quot;I told you so!&quot;<sup>17</sup></p>
    <p>In other words, Bach could immediately see the pregnant developmental possibilities of
    a given theme &#151; for example, which fugal development methods were appropriate:
    counterposing the theme to other voices playing the same theme, but starting at different
    times; maybe to the same theme played twice as long, or twice as fast; or to a changed
    theme, or part of the theme, maybe even upside down (inverted); or against one or more
    different musical ideas.</p>
    <p>It also worked the other way around. A composer like Bach would choose an appropriate
    fugal theme based, firstly, on what type of musical development he had decided to achieve,
    and, secondly, on what type of fugal treatment could cause that result. The chosen theme
    would then be designed to be developed in that way.</p>
    <p>Laurence Dreyfus, whose viol quartet recorded Mozart's transcriptions of Bach's
    four-voice fugues, wrote that one can see in the Bach fugues, &quot;all kinds of
    foreshadowings of what later become staples of part-writing in Mozart's late string
    quartets.&quot; Referring to the fact that Beethoven, Schumann, and Brahms were great
    pianists and well-versed in Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier,<cf1> Dreyfus posed the irony that
    &quot;the language of Bach's four-voice fugues, perhaps even more than the canonic
    repertory of string quartets themselves, should profoundly inform so much of their
    polyphonic thinking.&quot;</p>
    <p>Mozart's act of transcribing Bach's fugues, enabled Bach, who died earlier in the same
    decade in which Mozart was born, to become Mozart's teacher&#151;from his grave!</p>
    <p>Mozart's string transcriptions also give performers and listeners greater ability to
    distinguish the separate voices, and follow their interplay, because of the unique
    &quot;colors&quot; and registration of the different string instruments. (This author has
    also experimented with having a vocal trio, comprised of three different types of singing
    voices, sing sections of one of Bach's three-part fugues, Fugue No. 8, Book&nbsp;I of the <cf2>Well-Tempered
    Clavier,<cf1> during a class on polyphony and counterpoint.)</p>
    <h4>The Mozart-Haydn Dialogue</h4>
    <p>Mozart's four-voice fugues based on Bach were written six months after the publication
    of Haydn's revolutionary Op. 33 in 1781. Haydn's breakthrough in writing his Op. 33 string
    quartets, which he called <cf2>&quot;auf eine ganz neue, besondere Art&quot;<cf1> (in an entirely
    new and special manner), was based on two musical discoveries. The first was his steps in
    the development of the kind of independence and equal standing of the different voices
    which characterized Bach's fugues, for the four voices of a string quartet&#151;how to
    write string quartets which are not limited to the first violin playing the melody, and
    the three other instruments playing more or less an &quot;um-pa-pa&quot; accompaniment.
    The second was the concept Prof. Norbert Brainin, the former first violinist of the
    legendary Amadeus Quartet, has termed <cf2>&quot;Motivführung&quot;<cf1>&#151;a unity of the
    composition, achieved through the creative development of a musical motivic element
    presented at the very beginning, through playing with the potential variations and
    oppositions (inversions or <i>negations</i>) of that motivic element. Development was not
    limited to the &quot;development&quot; sections, but continued throughout the work.</p>
    <p><img src="Brainin.JPG" width="227" height="159" alt="Brainin.JPG (11797 bytes)"
    align="left" hspace="8" border="1">In response to Haydn, Mozart would write his six
    &quot;Haydn Quartets&quot; from December 1782 to January 1785 (K. 387, 421, 428, 458, 464,
    465). In these quartets, Mozart took what he had learned from his study of Bach, and from
    Haydn's breakthroughs, and continued the musical revolution at an even higher level.</p>
    <p>Listen to the fugue-like finale from the first of his &quot;Haydn Quartets&quot; K.
    387, the string quartet Mozart wrote in December 1782, while he was attending Baron van
    Swieten's salon, for a taste of Mozart's earliest attempt to learn from both of these
    masters, and go further. The last three quartets embodied even more contrapuntal writing
    than the earlier ones. Listen especially to the first, second, and last movements of the
    fifth &quot;Haydn Quartet,&quot; String Quartet in A Major, No. 18, K. 464, written in
    1785, for Mozart's use of chromaticism and contrapuntal development. The last movement,
    which is based on a chromatically transformed version of the theme of first movement, has
    been called the &quot;contrapuntal <cf2>ne plus ultra<cf1>&quot; of Mozart's Haydn quartets.</p>
    <p>After hearing the last three of these quartets performed, Haydn said to Mozart's father
    Leopold, &quot;Before God, and as an honest man I tell you that your son is the greatest
    composer known to me either in person or by name. He has taste and, what it more, the most
    profound knowledge of composition.&quot; Haydn's earlier string quartets had also had an
    impact on the young Mozart. Before Op. 33, Haydn's string quartets with fugal finales had
    become a model for Mozart's early string quartets of 1772-73.</p>
    <p>Musicologist Alfred Einstein, in the chapter on counterpoint in his book on Mozart,<sup>18</sup>
    stressed that it was the development section of Haydn's &quot;Dialogue Quartets,&quot; Op.
    33 String Quartets, which helped Mozart to take what he had learned from Bach's
    counterpoint, and make it into something new and Mozartian. Haydn's new works helped
    Mozart to learn to <i>play</i> with counterpoint and polyphony.</p>
    <p>It is reported that, in 1784, Mozart and Haydn actually played string quartets together
    in a &quot;composers quartet,&quot; with Haydn playing first violin, and Mozart playing
    viola, together with two other musicians. <sup>19</sup></p>
    <p>The string quartet-centered musical revolution started by Haydn and Mozart was brought
    to a pinnacle by Beethoven. As Norbert Brainin has stated, the high point of
    string-quartet writing was found in Beethoven's late string quartets, because the
    independence of each of the four voices is the greatest (yet they create the most
    beautiful whole).</p>
    <p>There is a similar concept in Schiller's work entitled <cf2>Kallias, or On the Beautiful.<cf1>
    There, Schiller states that a landscape painting is beautifully composed, when all parts
    play into one another as a whole, yet, each part seems to be acting out of its own free
    will. A tree bends down of its own weight, and thereby lets the mountain behind it be
    seen.</p>
    <h4>Mozart's Own Fugal Writing</h4>
    <p>On April 20, 1782, just a few days after the above-mentioned letter in which Mozart
    told his father that he was collecting fugues by Bach, he wrote the following letter to
    his sister and fellow-musician, Maria-Anna, called Nannerl. Included was Mozart's
    &quot;Fantasy and Fugue&quot; (K. 394). He wrote,</p>
    <p><img src="Constanze.JPG" width="142" height="187" alt="Constanze.JPG (8246 bytes)"
    align="left" hspace="8" border="1">&quot;I composed the fugue first and wrote it down
    while I was thinking out the prelude. I only hope that you will be able to read it, for it
    is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall
    send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze [whom Mozart would marry in
    August] is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to
    whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home
    with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely
    fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in
    this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach.</p>
    <p>&quot;Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had
    ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording
    some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never
    ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her. So this is its origin.</p>
    <p>&quot;I have purposely written above it, <cf2>Andante Maestoso<cf1>, as it must not be played too
    fast. For if a fugue is not played slowly, the ear cannot clearly distinguish the theme
    when it comes in, and consequently, the effect is entirely missed. When I get the time and
    opportunity, I will make another five [fugues] and deliver them to Baron van Suiten;
    because I have to say, he really owns, while admittedly very small in quantity, but in
    regard to quality, a very great treasure of good music.</p>
    <p>&quot;And therefore, I ask you to promise me not to take back your promise, and let no
    man see them. Learn them by heart and play them. A fugue is not so easy to play after only
    hearing it. &#151; If father has not yet had the works of Eberlin copied, then I would be
    very pleased &#151; I have gotten hold of them and &#151; because I could no longer
    remember that, with a closer look, they are of too low a quality, and truthfully, do not
    deserve a place between Händel and Bach....&quot;</p>
    <p>Here we can catch the first glimpse of the effect that studying Bach's and Händel's
    fugues had on stimulating Mozart's own creativity, and also the effect that Mozart's wife,
    the soprano Constanze's love for the fugue had on encouraging Mozart to develop his
    creativity through this art.<sup>20 </sup></p>
    <p>After 1783 or 1784, Mozart stopped writing fugues as musical exercises.</p>
    <p>In addition to the &quot;Haydn Quartets&quot; mentioned above, the inspiration Mozart
    derived from studying Bach's fugal methods can be seen in the following works, among
    others, written during and after the 1782 period: </p>
    <p>* A group of unfinished fugues <sup>21</sup></p>
    <p>Einstein notes that the many unfinished fugues were not unfinished masterpieces, which
    were a shame to have been left undone, and were just waiting for a student to finish.
    Rather, he most probably dropped them, because he found them lacking in developmental
    potential. Most were left off during the developmental section, or just before.</p>

    a string quartet).</p>
    <p>*&nbsp;Mozart's C Minor Mass, K. 427 (417a), unfinished</p>
    <p>Mozart worked on his C Minor Mass during the period he was attending Baron van
    Swieten's salon in 1782-83. He had originally planned to perform it in Salzburg, the city
    of his birth, after his marriage to Constanze, but he did not finish it. The uncompleted
    mass was performed in October 1783, with Constanze as a soprano soloist.</p>
    <p>The conductor of the Mozartverein, Kappelmeister Alois Schmitt, in the tradition of
    Mozart's pupil Süssmayr's work to complete Mozart's <cf2>Requiem,<cf1> edited and completed the
    Mass in C Minor, completing the instrumentation from sketches, and adding sections from
    other Mozart masses to fill in the missing parts.</p>
    <p>Schmitt explicitly acknowledged Bach and Händel's influence on the composition of this
    work, and names Mozart's transcriptions of Bach's fugues in the preface to the first
    edition:</p>
    <p>&quot;Thanks to the Sunday concerts at Baron van Swieten's home, Mozart had become
    quite well acquainted with the past masters Bach and Händel. He arranged ten fugues by
    Bach for string instruments and instrumented several oratorios by Händel for Baron van
    Swieten....&quot; After commenting on Händel's influence, Schmitt continued, &quot;On the
    other hand, the quartet Benedictus is more in the spirit of Bach. The austere sweetness,
    the masterful polyphony of this piece give it a unique flavour found nowhere else in
    Mozart literature.&quot;</p>
    <p>Bach's influence is also evident in:</p>
    <p>*&nbsp;The <cf2>&quot;Cum Sancto Spiritu&quot;<cf1> section, and the double fugue
    &quot;Hosana.&quot;</p>
    <p>*&nbsp;The <cf2>Jupiter Symphony,<cf1> No. 41, K. 551,<sup> 22</sup> with the great contrapuntal

    <h4>Mozart's Compositional Method</h4>
    <p>Alfred Einstein wrote that Mozart's father, Leopold, called the developmental unity,
    the progression of musical thought, <cf2>&quot;il filo,&quot;<cf1> the thread. It was that <cf2>&quot;filo,&quot;<cf1>
    which Mozart followed, which is so dependent on the &quot;right&quot; beginning, that the
    beginning must be at a high enough level, because everything else develops out of that
    &quot;kernel.&quot; It is the <cf2>&quot;filo&quot;<cf1> that Mozart had in his mind before he
    started writing notes down. He would write &quot;the whole&quot; down first, for vocal
    music, the first violin, the singing voices and the bass line all the way through, adding
    the middle instrumental voices later. As for chamber music, or a symphony, he would write
    down the leading voices first, hopping from instrument to instrument, depending on which
    one took the lead, and would add the other parts afterwards.</p>
    <p>However, for certain complex contrapuntal sections, Mozart would first work out the
    details, before writing out the whole <cf2>partitur,<cf1> for example, the <cf2>Allegro<cf1> section of the
    Prague Symphony, the manuscript of which had been located shortly before Einstein wrote
    his book.</p>
    <h4>More on Bach's Influence on Mozart</h4>
    <p>Baron van Swieten's Viennese salon was not the first encounter Mozart had with the Bach
    family. In 1762, when Mozart was a child of six, J.S. Bach's son, Johann Christian,
    befriended him in London, where the Mozart family lived for several years. The symphonies
    that the child prodigy Mozart composed there were largely modelled on Johann Christian
    Bach's, and especially Mozart's earliest piano concertos, written after he returned to
    Salzburg.</p>
    <p>The last movement of Mozart's D major Concerto (K. 40) was taken from Philipp Emanuel
    Bach. The question is, which, if any, of Johann Sebastian's works were known by Mozart
    during this period.</p>
    <p>Also, after the 1782 Baron van Swieten period, Mozart became quite excited, after
    listening to J.S. Bach's choral works, first as they were performed, and then, in his
    mind, as he studied the scores. Mozart visited Leipzig in 1789, where he went to the St.
    Thomas Church, where Bach had been cantor, to play the organ. The new cantor, who had been
    Bach's student, Johann Friedrich Doles, was in attendance. An eyewitness wrote,
    &quot;Mozart played without previous announcement and without compensation on the organ of
    the church of St. Thomas. He played beautifully and artistically before a large audience
    for about an hour.... Doles was utterly delighted with his playing and thought that old
    Sebastian Bach ... had been resurrected. With good taste and with the greatest ease Mozart
    employed all the arts of harmony and gloriously improvised upon the themes, among others
    of the chorale <cf2>'Jesu, meine Zuversicht'<cf1>....&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;At the instigation of Doles, the cantor of the Thomasschule in Leipzig, the choir
    surprised Mozart by performing the motet for double choir, <cf2>'Singet dem Herrn ein neues
    Lied,'<cf1> by the patriarch of German music, Sebastian Bach. As soon as the choir had sung a
    few bars, Mozart started; after a few more he exclaimed: 'What is that?' And now his whole
    soul seemed to be centered in his ears. When the song was ended, he cried out with
    delight: 'Now, here is something one can learn from!'</p>
    <p>&quot;He was informed that this school, where Sebastian Bach had once been cantor,
    possessed a complete collection of his motets, which were preserved as if they were a
    saint's relics. 'That is right, that is fine,' he exclaimed. 'Let me see them' There was,
    however, no complete score of these songs. He therefore took the separate parts, and then,
    what a pleasure it was for the quiet observer to see how eagerly Mozart sat down, the
    parts all around him, held in both hands, on his knees, on the nearest chairs. Forgetting
    everything else, he did not stand up again until he had looked through all the music of
    Sebastian Bach. He asked for copies....&quot;<sup> 23</sup></p>

    <p>Who(se): <ul>
      <li>father admired Benjamin Franklin, calling himself a &quot;small republican?&quot;</li>

    </ul>
    <p>The answer to every question is: Baron Gottfried van Swieten. </p>
    <p><img src="Swieten.JPG" width="180" height="234" alt="Swieten.JPG (18631 bytes)"
    align="right" border="1" hspace="8">Baron Gottfried van Swieten (1733-1803), though not a
    professional musician, may be the music-lover who had the greatest impact on the
    development of Western Classical music. His great love for, and promotion of the music of
    Bach and Händel, who lived a generation before him, and his decisive influence on three
    of the greatest Classical musicians of his, or any time, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven,
    grants Baron van Swieten a special place in musical history.</p>
    <p>What was the background of this musical midwife who helped to provoke such a profound
    revelation in Mozart?</p>
    <p>Baron Gottfried van Swieten, born in the Netherlands, was the eldest son of Dr. Gerhard
    van Swieten (1700-72). Dr. Van Swieten was summoned to Vienna to become the personal
    physician of the Empress of the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire, Maria Theresa, in 1745,
    and held several other posts, including director of the court library. Though employed by
    the Empire, he openly admired Benjamin Franklin, and called himself a &quot;small
    republican.&quot;</p>
    <p>His son, Gottfried van Swieten, educated at the Jesuit &quot;Theresianum,&quot; became
    a diplomat, representing the court of Vienna in Brussels (1755-7), Paris (1760-63), Warsaw
    (1763-64), England (1768-69), and as Ambassador Extraordinary at the Prussian court in
    Berlin, from 1770 to 1777, where he was the liaison between Vienna's Chancellor Count
    Kaunitz, and Frederick the Great. (His superior in Brussels said that his only criticism
    was that &quot;music takes up the best part of his time.&quot;)<sup>24</sup></p>
    <p>Early in life, the Baron composed at least three comic operas, and 10-12 symphonies.<sup>25</sup>
    (His collaborator Haydn, though, later characterized them as being &quot;as stiff as he
    is.&quot;)</p>
    <p>One researcher reports that the Baron first became enchanted with Baroque music while
    living in England.</p>
    <p>Baron van Swieten wrote that none other than the King of Prussia, Frederick the Great,
    introduced him to the music of Bach, in Berlin. In a confidential letter to Count Kaunitz
    on July 26, 1774, the Baron wrote, &quot;Among other things, he [the King] spoke about
    music and about a great organ player by the name of Bach [J.S. Bach's son Wilhelm
    Friedemann Bach], who had just given a concert in Berlin. This artist is equipped with a
    talent which supercedes everything which I have heard or can imagine in the direction of
    in-depth harmonic abilities and power in his playing, while they, who have known his
    father, do not find that he can measure up to him. The King is of that opinion, and to
    prove it, with a loud voice, he sang a chromatic fugal theme, which he had given to the
    old Bach, who, on the spot, made a fugue with four voices, thereafter with five voices,
    and at the end, one with eight obbligato voices.&quot; The King referred here to J.S.
    Bach's visit in May 1747, which led to the composition of his great work, <cf2>The Musical
    Offering<cf1>.<sup>26</sup></p>
    <p>During the Baron's stay in Berlin (1770-77), he attended the musical salons held by
    Fredrick the Great's sister, Princess Anna Amelia of Prussia (1723-87), where J.S. Bach
    and Händel were the favorite composers. He was to love and promote the music of these two
    composers for the rest of his life. Van Swieten even studied composition with a student of
    J.S. Bach, Princess Anna Amelia's musical advisor, Kappelmeister Johann Philipp Kirnberger
    (1721-83), an important musical theoretician.</p>
    <p>The Baron was also in contact with other students of Bach. Van Swieten visited one of
    Bach's sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel, in Hamburg in 1774, the same year he first heard about
    him from the King. He corresponded with C.P.E., and bought some of J.S. Bach's manuscripts
    from him, including copies of fugues, many years before they were printed. He also
    commissioned six string symphonies (W. 182) from him, and C.P.E. Bach dedicated his third
    set of <cf2>Sonaten für Kenner und Liebhaber<cf1> (W. 57) to Van Swieten. The Baron knew Bach
    student Johann Friederich Agricola, the Prussian court's composer and author. Another of
    Bach's sons, Wilhelm Friedmann, who moved to Berlin in 1774, also made a great impression
    on van Swieten.</p>
    <p>The Baron brought several of J.S. Bach's printed works to Vienna, including <cf2>The Art of
    the Fugue<cf1>, and also manuscripts of <cf2>The Well-Tempered Clavier<cf1>, the &quot;Organ Trios,&quot;
    and possibly some of the &quot;Preludes and Fugues for Organ.&quot; In addition to piano
    and organ works by Bach, the Baron also had several of Bach's motets and his larger choral
    works<sup>.27</sup></p>
    <p>Upon his return to Vienna, he succeeded his father as director of the court library,
    and was appointed president of the Education and Censorship Commission in 1782. The Baron
    was supportive of the reform ideas of Emperor Joseph II, Maria Theresa's son, who
    succeeded her.</p>
    <p>The Mozarts first met the Baron during their trip to Vienna in 1767-68. During the
    negotiations surrounding the composition and production of Mozart's opera <cf2>La Finta
    Semplice<cf1>, Wolfgang responded to criticism that the opera was &quot;unsingable,&quot; by
    playing the whole opera on Baron van Swieten's piano, to a group of music lovers who were
    &quot;greatly moved.&quot; Later, in 1781, the Baron heard Mozart's opera <cf2>Idomeneo,<cf1> as
    well as Mozart giving a concert, where he played a Concerto (K. 365) and a Sonata for Two
    Pianos (K. 448).</p>
    <p>The Baron's importance for the promotion of J.S. Bach's works is evidenced by the fact
    that the first Bach biography, written by Johann Nikolaus Forkel, was dedicated to him.</p>
    <p>At van Swieten's salon, in addition to pedagogical investigations of instrumental
    works, they also sang together, with van Swieten singing soprano, Mozart singing alto,
    simultaneously playing the piano, while two other musicians sang tenor and bass.</p>
    <p>During the 1780s, Van Swieten formed a group of noblemen interested in &quot;old
    music,&quot; called the <cf2>Gesellschaft der Associierten<cf1>, which arranged concerts in the
    Royal Library, or their palaces, of works of C.P.E. Bach, and oratorios of Händel. Mozart
    became the director of these concerts in 1787, conducting an orchestra of 86 musicians.
    Mozart wrote new arrangements of Händel's <cf2>Messiah,<cf1> &quot;Acis and Galatea,&quot;
    &quot;Alexander's Feast,&quot; and the &quot;Ode for St. Cecilia's Day&quot; for the
    concerts. There is current research regarding a manuscript, previously unknown, of an
    arrangement of Händel's <cf2>Judas Maccabaeus,<cf1> attributed on the title page to Mozart,
    recently found in Halifax, England<sup>.28</sup> He also wrote wind instrument
    arrangements of some of Händel's works.<sup>29</sup></p>
    <p>New arrangements were made because neither the Royal Library, nor the palaces had
    organs, which were a part of Händel's instrumentation, and due to the changed
    instrumentation practice of the time, which included adding clarinets and trombones.<sup>30</sup>
    In a letter from the Baron to Mozart, of questioned authenticity, regarding Mozart's idea
    of arranging the aria &quot;If God Be for Us&quot; from the <cf2>Messiah<cf1>, he is said to have
    written, &quot;He who can clothe Händel so solemnly and so tastefully that he pleases the
    modish fop on the one hand and on the other still shows himself in his sublimity, has felt
    his worth, has understood him, has penetrated to the well-spring of his expression, from
    which he can and will draw confidently. That is how I view what you have
    accomplished....&quot; The Baron himself conducted a performance of Mozart's arrangement
    of Händel's &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; at the home of Count Esterházy.</p>
    <p>C.P.E. Bach's <cf2>Die Auferstehung und Himmelfahrt Christi<cf1> was also performed under
    Mozart's baton.</p>
    <p>During the last decade of Mozart's life, the Baron, to a certain extent, helped Mozart
    financially, including commissioning the Händel arrangements, and when Mozart became
    disillusioned with the musical tastes at Court, Mozart wrote that van Swieten was among
    the group of Vienna's music lovers who asked him to stay. In 1789, Mozart wrote that after
    two weeks of circulation, the only name on a subscription list to support Mozart's
    concerts, was that of the Baron.</p>
    <p>On the very day that Mozart died, Dec. 5, 1791, the Baron was dismissed by the Emperor
    Leopold II, who opposed Joseph II's reform policy. According to musicologist E. Olleson,
    &quot;The death of Joseph II, in January 1790, strengthened the hand of those who opposed
    the educational reforms [his and van Swieten's, head of Joseph II's Education and
    Censorship Commission], and a bitter struggle developed, lasting almost two
    years....&quot; <sup>31</sup></p>
    <p>Another source wrote that the Baron fell, most probably, because of his association
    with the Masonic-linked Illuminati lodge. It is possible that he first came into contact
    with the Illuminati in Berlin, but in any case, he was listed as a member of the lodge in
    Prague. The Baron's loyalty to the Crown seems to have come into question, when a tutor he
    had arranged for the Crown Prince, Johann Baptist von Schloissnigg, was accused and
    investigated for being a member of the Illuminati, with rumors flying that the Baron was
    part of a conspiracy. The affair &quot;climax[ed] in the hours after Mozart's
    demise.&quot; Further investigation is needed, given the questions surrounding Mozart's
    death, of the fact that his sponsor, Baron van Swieten was swept from power on the very
    day Mozart died, amidst charges of political conspiracy. (Mozart, himself, was a member of
    the pro-American Revolution faction of the Masons.)</p>
    <p>After Mozart's untimely death, two months short of his 36th birthday, van Swieten
    arranged the first performance in Vienna of Mozart's <cf2>Requiem,<cf1> to benefit Mozart's wife,
    Constanze. He also supported Mozart's son, until Constanze remarried,<sup>32</sup>
    including paying for his schooling in Prague.</p>
    <p>Baron van Swieten also had a profound influence on two other musical geniuses, Haydn
    and Beethoven.</p>
    <h4>Haydn</h4>
    <p>While stationed in Berlin, the Baron championed Haydn's works, but his greatest impact
    on Haydn's music was helping to cause the composition of three of Haydn's great oratorios.
    Van Swieten had paid for Haydn's second trip to London, where he became enthusiastic about
    the Händelian oratorio tradition still alive there. Afterwards, the Baron encouraged
    Haydn to write his own oratorios, <cf2>The Seven Words, The Creation<cf1>(1798), and <cf2>The Seasons<cf1>
    (1801), and it was actually the Baron himself, who wrote the German librettos for them.
    Van Swieten played an increasingly important role in the preparation of the three
    libretti.</p>
    <p><img src="Haydn.JPG" width="227" height="242" alt="Haydn.JPG (17748 bytes)"
    align="left" border="1" hspace="8">Regarding <cf2>The Seven Words,<cf1> he arranged Josef Friebert's
    text to Haydn's taste, with relatively small changes. The background to <cf2>The Creation<cf1> is
    more interesting. One source wrote that Haydn brought an anonymous English libretto back
    with him from England, based on John Milton's <cf2>Paradise Lost<cf1>, which was said to have been
    written for Händel. Van Swieten wrote, rather than simply translated, a German libretto
    from this, but closely followed the plan in the English libretto.</p>
    <p>The entire conception for <cf2>The Seasons<cf1> libretto was the Baron's, based on an English
    poem by James Thomson. He also wrote suggestions in the margin of the librettos for <cf2>The
    Creation<cf1> and <cf2>The Seasons<cf1> about how the text might be set to music, especially the
    descriptive passages.<sup>33</sup> (On a humorous note, Haydn later eliminated a passage
    in <cf2>The Seasons<cf1> that imitated the croaking of frogs, saying that van Swieten had forced him
    to write it.)</p>
    <p>One can say that van Swieten caused <cf2>The Seasons<cf1> to be written. A tired Haydn was close
    to 70 years old when van Swieten wrote the libretto, proposed the musical plan for the
    work, and pressured him to agree to compose the piece, which took Haydn three years, with
    constant encouragement (or pressure) from the Baron. This year marks the 200th anniversary
    of <cf2>The Seasons<cf1> premier in 1801, at a concert financed by Baron van Swieten and his
    friends.</p>
    <p>Van Swieten collaborated with Haydn in the production of the vocal editions of the
    three oratorios. The <cf2>Gesellschaft der Associierten,<cf1> established by the Baron, arranged the
    financing, and the first performances of all three works.</p>
    <h4>Beethoven</h4>
    <p>Beethoven was already fully acquainted with Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier<cf1> before meeting
    the Baron. At the same time that the 27-year-old Mozart was being introduced to many of
    Bach's works at the Baron's musical salon in Vienna, in Bonn, the 11-year-old Beethoven
    was playing most of Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier<cf1>, according to the written statement,
    dated March 1783, by his teacher Christian Gottlob Neefe.</p>

    with power, reads at sight very well, and&#151;to put it in a nutshell&#151;he plays
    chiefly <cf2>The Well-Tempered Clavichord<cf1> of Sebastian Bach, which Herr Neefe put into his
    hands. Whoever knows this collection of preludes and fugues in all the keys&#151;which
    might almost be called the <cf2>non plus ultra<cf1> of our art&#151;will know what this means. Herr
    Neefe has also given him instruction in thorough-bass. He is now training him ins
    composition.... He would surely become a second Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were he to
    continue as he has begun.&quot; Neefe was a close friend of a successor of Bach as cantor
    of Thomaskirche, Hiller.</p>
    <p>In 1787, at the age of 16, Beethoven visited Vienna for the first time, impressing
    Mozart with his improvisational abilities, and receiving a few music theory lessons from
    him. Professor Jahn, a biographer of Mozart, relates the story of the first meeting
    between Beethoven and Mozart. Beethoven &quot;was taken to Mozart and at that musician's
    request played something for him which he, taking it for granted that it was a show-piece
    prepared for the occasion, praised in a rather cool manner. Beethoven observing this,
    begged Mozart to give him a theme for improvisation. He always played admirably when
    excited and now he was inspired, too, by the presence of the master whom he reverenced
    greatly; he played in such a style that Mozart, whose attention and interest grew more and
    more, finally went silently to some friends to were sitting in an adjoining room, and
    said, vivaciously, 'Keep your eyes on him; some day he will give the world something to
    talk about.'&nbsp;&quot;<sup> 34</sup></p>
    <p>In 1792, a year after Mozart's death, Beethoven moved to Vienna, for the purpose of
    studying with Haydn. Mozart's death had left Vienna without a truly great pianist, until
    the arrival of Beethoven. Beethoven's leading biographer, Thayer, states that all
    contemporary authorities attested to Beethoven's success on his arrival in Vienna,
    attributing it to &quot;his playing of Bach's preludes and fugues especially,&quot; as
    well as his sight-reading and improvisational capabilities.</p>
    <p>To repeat, it was especially Beethoven's ability to play Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier<cf1>
    magnificently, in a Vienna that Baron van Swieten had brought to love Bach, which opened
    all doors for him, and which drew him into the Baron's musical circle. Beethoven's close
    friend Schidler stated that after musical performances in his house, the Baron
    &quot;detained Beethoven and persuaded him to add a few fugues by Sebastian Bach as an
    evening blessing.&quot;<sup> 35</sup></p>
    <p>It just might have been the case that the elderly Baron sat in the same imagined chair
    as above, with his eyes closed, while Mozart's successor, Beethoven, serenaded him with
    Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered Clavier<cf1>.</p>
    <p>Baron van Swieten encouraged Beethoven to study counterpoint, and often asked about his
    progress. Beethoven, like Mozart, also transcribed two of J.S. Bach's <cf2>Well-Tempered
    Clavier<cf1> fugues for string quartet for study purposes, that in B flat minor, and an
    incomplete version of the fugue in B minor, both from Book&nbsp;I.</p>
    <p>Beethoven had great respect for Bach, later asking his publisher for all of Bach's
    works, calling him the <cf2>&quot;Urvater der Harmonie,&quot;<cf1> the &quot;patriarch of musical
    harmony.&quot; On another occasion, Beethoven said, <cf2>&quot;Bach sollte nicht Bach, sondern
    Meer heissen&quot;<cf1> (Bach should not be called <cf2>Bach<cf1> (brook), but <cf2>Meer<cf1> (ocean), because of
    his infinite and inexhaustible wealth of combinations and harmonies.&quot; Beethoven
    copied out and highlighted a quote about Bach's music, from Forkel's biography of Bach,
    which included, &quot;Only the connoisseur who can surmise the inner organization and feel
    it and penetrate to the intention of the artist, which does nothing needlessly, is
    privileged to judge here; indeed the judgment of a musical connoisseur can scarcely be
    better tested than by seeing how rightly he has learned the works of Bach.&quot;</p>
    <p>Baron van Swieten also had a literary influence on Beethoven, introducing him to
    Shakespeare and discussing Homer with him.</p>
    <p>The Baron's importance for Beethoven is evidenced by the fact that, in 1800, Beethoven
    dedicated his first symphony to him.</p>
    <p>Let the story of Baron Gottfried van Swieten conclude with the obituary about him
    printed in the <cf2>Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung<cf1> in 1803:</p>
    <p>&quot;In him, music loses a significant Maecenas, and the world an upright and loyal
    man.... Swieten was an adherent of no school or sect, every true talent he welcomed;
    nevertheless, his favorites were Händel, Sebastian Bach, Mozart, and Haydn, with whom he
    occupied himself almost daily. Would that a man of high station may soon come forward, who
    will so actively espouse the cause of music as did Swieten!&quot;</p>

    <sup><p></sup><small>7. The musicologist Alfred Einstein, who wrote an important biography
    of Mozart, bases his contention that they were composed by Mozart, on the process of
    elimination -- that they could not have been written by anyone else from that time.
    &quot;&#133;that these arrangements, although not authenticated by the existence of an
    autograph manuscript, could only have come from Mozart. Only Johann Georg Albrechtsberger
    (the great contrapuntist, and student of Bach-mr), whose Six String Quartets, Op. 21 show
    exactly the same design (six adagios and fugues), could also be considered as their
    author; yet Albrechtsberger's creative imagination and feel for style came far short of
    that shown in these four adagio movements.&quot; (record notes 3-part f, also find
    citation from Einstein. art.) </small></p>
    <p><small>In a 1936 article Einstein had previously stated that Albrechtsberger could not
    be the author, &quot;Able and estimable as he was, a glance at the prelude quoted with
    this article (the prelude that accompanies Fugue No. 13 from Book II of Bach's WTC) is
    sufficient to show that no other master than Mozart could have written it. Mozartian is
    the delicate grace of the melody, Mozartian is the courage which accompanies it with such
    a galant figure, Mozartian too is the terseness, the concise form, which does not for a
    second forget the introductory character of these forty bars, and Mozartian is the
    agreement of prelude with fugue, which winged, playful character he has realized most
    finely.&quot; Einstein continues with descriptions of how well-suited the other preludes
    are to their fugues. (Musical Times, page 212.)</small><sup></p>

    exercise, dominated by court Kapellmeister Johann Joseph Fux's book<i> Gradus ad Parnassum</i>
    from 1725. Fux banned the use of the Lydian interval, the interval between three whole
    notes, for example: C-F# (also called the tritone), in line with those who called it
    &quot;the devil's interval:&quot; &quot;<i>mi</i> against <i>fa</i> is the devil in
    musica.&quot; The Study of Counterpoint: from Johann Joseph Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum, tr.

    <sup><p></sup><small>19. The Irish tenor Michael Kelly wrote about his hearing them play
    together in 1784, &quot;Storace gave a quartett (sic) party to his friends. The players
    were tolerable; not one of them excelled on the instrument he played, but there was a
    little science among them, which I dare say will be acknowledged when I name them: Haydn,
    first violin; Baron Dittersdorf, second violin; Mozart, viola; and Vanhal, cello. (Mozart
    St. Q. CD notes.)</small></p>
    <p><small>The quartet which played at the Baron&#146;s 1794-95 quartet parties included:
    Haydn; Beethoven&#146;s friend, the violinist Schuppanzigh; and Emmanuel Aloys Foerster,
    who had set Bach for string quartet, in association with the Baron, back in 1779-80,
    before Mozart came to Vienna.</small></p>
    <sup><p></sup><small>20. Constanza also participated in Mozart's musical life in other
    ways. Mozart wrote works for four-handed piano, and for piano and violin, which they
    played together. Mozart gave Constanza an intimate knowledge of whatever he was working
    on, including having her sing all of his operas. Regarding Constanza's musical taste, when
    hearing Haydn's quartets, she expressed that she liked the parts with the &quot;strong
    spices&quot; the most. (From German language book on Mozart.)</small><sup></p>
    <p></sup><small>21. K. Anh. 33 and 40 (383b), Fugue in F major; K. Anh. 39 (383d), Fugue

    Fugue in E major; and K. deest, Fugue in D minor.</small></p>
    <sup><p></sup><small>22. The musicologist Alfred Einstein stressed the &quot;decisive
    important of Bach on Mozart's musical development, and the inspiration for the great
    contrapuntal finales, like the String Quartet K. 387 and the Jupiter Symphony, and the use
    of counterpoint in his other Vienna compositions. RL, pg. 221.</small><sup></p>
    <p></sup><small>23. One piece of evidence of the effect that Bach's choral works had on
    Mozart's writing afterwards, can be seen in Die Zauberflöte's Scene 28 (armed men) in Act
    2&#146;s finale, where he placed a Lutheran choral tune, Ach Gott von Himmel sigh Darien,
    based on Bach's Cantata No. 2 on the same choral, in a contrapuntal setting. This cantata
    was in the collection Mozart studied in Leipzig. Marshall 18. </small></p>

    elaboration of the King&#146;s theme. </small></p>
    <sup><p></sup><small>27. There has been a debate about how much Bach was known in Vienna
    before Van Swieten came home from Berlin. It is known that one Viennese musician,
    Wagenseil, had his students study Bach's and Händel's harpsichord suites. (Schenk, 325-6)
    The musicologist Alfred Einstein maintained that the works that the Baron brought home
    were either unknown in Vienna before that, or that there were not many other copies than
    Van Swieten's. (Einstein 155-156, and Musical Times.) Another source states that some Bach
    manuscripts circulated in Austria, including his Well-Tempered Clavier, but that Mozart
    did not know of their works until the 1780's. (RL, 78.) </small></p>
    <sup><p></sup><small>28. The manuscript, not in Mozart&#146;s hand, was found by music
    lecturer Dr. Rachel Cowgill, in a choral music collection of William Priestley, clothier
    and member of the Halifax Choral Society, which he said came from Moravians in Germany,
    probably via Moravian settlements in his area. In the slow movements, and solo parts, new
    counter-melodies played by the clarinet and flute were added, which Dr. Cowgill terms
    beautiful. (Rachel Cowgill, How I found &#145;Mozart&#146; in Halifax, The Guardian, March
    17, 2001. www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4153487,00.html)</small></p>
    <sup><p></sup><small>29. Emperor Franz II, Emperor Joseph II's son, put his choir and
    orchestra at the disposal of the Baron for these concerts. </small></p>
    <sup><p></sup><small>30. &quot;To this end he (the Baron-mr) employed the talents of our
    Mozart, who knew how to give new life to Handel&#146;s noble inspirations by means of the
    warmth of his own feelings, and through the magic of his own instrumental style to make
    them enjoyable for our age.&quot; From Franz Xaver Niemetschek&#146;s Mozart Biography,

    <sup><p></sup><small>32. Constanze married the Danish diplomat Georg Nikolaus Nissen
    (1761-1826), and moved to Copenhagen. Nissen later wrote the first major biography of
    Mozart, with Constanze&#146;s supervision, entitled, Biographie W.A. Mozart&#146;s: nach
    Originalgriefen: Sammlungen alles über ihn Geschrieben. Constanze participated in the
    musical life of Copenhagen, and promoted the publication of the works of her late husband.</small></p>

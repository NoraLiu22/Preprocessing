<p dir="ltr">Ever since mega-star <a href="https://www.nickiswift.com/762289/the-untold-truth-of-rihanna/" target="_blank">Rihanna</a> and rapper A$AP Rocky confirmed <a href="https://www.thelist.com/287108/inside-rihanna-and-aap-rockys-relationship/" target="_blank">their relationship</a>, fans have been going wild for the couple, and it's certainly not hard to understand why. The two have been linked by friendship and business for almost a decade, and when things between them started to heat up, the internet took notice.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nickiswift.com/491088/the-transformation-of-rihanna-from-17-to-33/" target="_blank">Rihanna</a>, of course, needs no introduction. The songstress and business mogul has dominated industries for years now, and her iconic makeup and clothing lines have come second only to her music. A$AP, on the other hand, is an iconic rapper and performer in his own right, having even collaborated with Rihanna on occasion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that the couple has started growing their family, fans have been clamoring for an inside look into their journey to this point. When did they meet? What have they said about each other? Were kids always part of their plan? We did the digging so you don't have to — here's an inside look into Rihanna's relationship with A$AP Rocky.</p>

<p dir="ltr">To say that Rihanna is a hitmaker is a grave understatement. In 2012 alone, she released the iconic tracks "Where Have You Been," "No Love Allowed," and "Stay," just to name a few of her long list of amazing songs. The year also gave the songstress the opportunity to perform at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and who else joined her on stage but A$AP Rocky? Contributing to her performance of "Cockiness (Remix)," the performance marked one of the first instances that Rihanna and A$AP had crossed paths publicly, and to say that the interaction left an impression is an understatement.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">As noted by <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/2252410/asap-rocky-grabbed-rihanna-butt-2012-mtv-vma/" target="_blank">MTV</a>, A$AP marked the onset of the performance by placing his hand on Rihanna's behind (and, we should note that it was more of a "grab" than a gentle pat). Of their behavior, MTV reported that A$AP was clearly "flirting the entire time" with the "Umbrella" singer, even going in for a kiss while holding onto her.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rihanna and A$AP Rocky had <em>everyone</em> talking after their MTV Video Music Awards performance, and the pair certainly seemed to capitalize off the buzz. As noted by <a href="https://popcrush.com/asap-rocky-rihanna-diamonds-north-american-tour-2013/" target="_blank">PopCrush</a> at the time, when Rihanna announced that A$AP would join her on the North American leg of her 2013 Diamonds World Tour, the news did not disappoint. The duo started the tour off with a bang in March 2013 during a performance in Buffalo, New York, before returning to New York to wrap up the 30-city tour at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The tour came just months before Rihanna released her famed studio album "Unapologetic" and the dynamic between her and A$AP had really come to light. She <a href="https://twitter.com/rihanna/status/266262080917762050" target="_blank">tweeted</a> at the time of the announcement, "This is gonna be some Young Epic Rockstar sh**! See you on tour @asvpxrocky." A$AP then extended their working relationship by having Rihanna star in his music video for "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6VfsJ7LAlE&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">Fashion Killa</a>."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rihanna and A$AP Rocky teased fans with their MTV performance and their joint touring efforts, but, after that whirlwind died down, things seemed to cool off. Of course, Rihanna was busy creating an empire, while A$AP released his album "AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP" in 2015. However, the separation between Rihanna and A$AP (at least publicly) came to an end when they were spotted in Paris, France, together during Fashion Week in 2018. Already a star-studded event, Rihanna and A$AP added even more swag to the experience.</p>

News</a>, the songstress and rapper were seen with a litany of other celebrities during the Louis Vuitton menswear show. Featuring the work of Off-White's Virgil Abloh for the first time, Rihanna and A$AP took in the looks with the likes of Bella Hadid, Kanye West, and Kim Kardashian (her first time in Paris since being robbed in the city). Of course, Rihanna stunned in a white jumpsuit, bringing an effortless glam to the show's front row.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While Rihanna and A$AP Rocky were spotted together at Paris Fashion Week, the two were not romantically linked. If anything, the catwalk appearance commenced a very public friendship between the two, with A$AP becoming a staple at Rihanna's glamorous events. As noted by <a href="https://www.billboard.com/photos/rihanna-2018-diamond-ball-photos/" target="_blank">Billboard</a>, the rapper was among the A-listers who attended Rihanna's 2018 Diamond Ball. With the likes of Donald Glover and Tiffany Haddish in attendance, A$AP was right there alongside the celebrities clamoring for an invite. Rihanna once again had A$AP on the guest list of her 2019 Diamond Ball, per <a href="https://www.eonline.com/photos/28969/rihanna-s-2019-diamond-ball-star-sightings" target="_blank">E! News</a>, and the appearance was certainly a monumental one for the rapper.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1062037/a-ap-rocky-back-in-u-s-after-being-released-from-jail-in-sweden-what-s-next-for-the-rapper" target="_blank">E! News</a> at the time, Rihanna's 2019 Diamond Ball was A$AP's first red carpet appearance since his legal debacle in Stockholm, Sweden. After a brawl between himself, two friends, and a 19-year-old, the hitmaker found himself in Swedish prison for a month. While his case was still being deliberated, A$AP caught a private plane home and landed in Los Angeles (much to his relief, we can imagine).</p>

<p dir="ltr">There's nothing like a red carpet moment to get people talking, and when Rihanna and A$AP Rocky took the floor, all bets were off. It was the 2019 British Fashion Awards, and the <a href="https://www.thelist.com/228975/we-finally-have-details-about-rihannas-fenty-skincare-line/" target="_blank">Fenty Beauty</a> founder and rapper hit the carpet together (non-romantically, we should add). To say they left no crumbs is sorely underselling the appearance. As per <a href="https://okmagazine.com/photos/rihanna-asap-rocky-british-fashion-awards-2019-pics/" target="_blank">OK! Magazine</a>, Rihanna stunned in a Fenty-designed mint-green dress with coordinating gloves and jacket, while A$AP looked dapper in an all-black suit. The duo was photographed looking <em>very</em> chummy, which, of course, set the internet on fire.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">With time, we learned there was more to A$AP's look than we originally gathered from the photos of the glamorous outing. As reported by <a href="https://people.com/music/rihanna-and-asap-rocky-relationship-timeline/" target="_blank">People</a>, Rihanna was the designer behind A$AP's sleek look for the British Fashion Awards, which only goes to show that she can do literally anything she sets her mind to. As for A$AP, Rihanna's look that night was his "favorite outfit" of hers. We fully concur, because these two just looked wonderful together that night.</p>

                    					<p>
<p dir="ltr">If Rihanna and A$AP Rocky hadn't already proved their stardom to the world, their collaboration in mid-2020 set the world on fire. As per <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/rihanna-asap-rocky-fenty-skin-interview" target="_blank">Vogue</a>, Rihanna teamed up with the rapper to launch Fenty Skin, and the two sat down for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP0IYMwOZ8U" target="_blank">video</a> with the publication about their collaboration. During the interview, Rihanna and A$AP covered a variety of topics, and their back-and-forth dynamic made the interview that much more enjoyable to watch.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">And, why did Rihanna partner with A$AP for her skincare venture? One answer — have you seen A$AP? He's gorgeous. "Men love their skin, and they take care of it, but they feel obligated almost to only use products that are for men because anything beyond that feels too feminine, it's not for them, they're not allowed, they don't have permission," Rihanna said to A$AP. When the rapper then asked her to describe her own skin type, the famed singer retorted, "Just as complicated as men are." The exchange was truly delightful.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Anyone who's been following Rihanna and A$AP Rocky has known each other for years, but for the majority of that time, their dynamic was a friendly one. So how did the duo transition from friends to so much more? Rihanna opened up about the "friend zone" with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/rihanna-cover-may-2022" target="_blank">Vogue</a>, and how it took her quite some time to get used to the idea of seeing Rocky from a romantic perspective.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">"People don't get out of the friend zone very easily with me," the Fenty mogul said. "And I certainly took a while to get over how much I know him and how much he knows me, because we also know how much trouble we can land each other in."</p>
<p>But, like a lot of people, the two ended up bonding in a romantic way during the COVID-19 pandemic. They took a road trip from Los Angeles to New York, just the two of them. As Rihanna later told <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a39701388/how-rihanna-told-asap-rocky-pregnant/" target="_blank">Cosmopolitan</a>, one thing led to another. She said, "I cooked our food on this little janky grill I bought from Walmart. I still have it too. It works like nobody's business. I love the simple things but also the grand adventures. There's no pretentious my-brand-your-brand b*******, it's just us living. I just feel like I can do any part of life by his side." </p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>The singer also added that during the trip, her friend A$AP Rocky became "my family." She explained that the pair share a trust between them that allows them to really open up about everything they feel. The road trip allowed the two the space to just be themselves, which seems to be the push they needed to be together.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Fans of pop culture rejoiced when Rihanna and A$AP Rocky confirmed their romantic relationship in late 2020. A source assured the news to <a href="https://people.com/music/rihanna-is-dating-asap-rocky/" target="_blank">People</a>, as the love affair between them had been rumored until that point. People noted in its breaking report at the time that rumors from media outlets, like <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/11/30/rihanna-and-aap-rocky-have-night-out-in-new-york/" target="_blank">Page Six</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10840846/rihanna-dating-asap-rocky/" target="_blank">The Sun</a>, had been swirling around the then-unconfirmed couple — exactly why a trusted source then came forward with the exciting news.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Rihanna had been <a href="https://www.thelist.com/590980/the-complex-dating-history-of-rihanna-explained/" target="_blank">previously linked</a> to billionaire <a href="https://www.nickiswift.com/184229/the-truth-about-rihanna-and-hassan-jameels-split/" target="_blank">Hassan Jameel</a> and A$AP to the likes of <a href="https://www.thelist.com/34890/untold-truth-kendall-jenner/" target="_blank">Kendall Jenner</a> and model Daiane Sodré. But the longtime friends must've realized they had feelings for one another, and their news was met with enthusiasm among fans. "They've been inseparable the past few weeks. It's a new relationship, but they both seem very into it. They've always seemed to have a great time together. They have a lot in common," a source told <a href="https://people.com/music/rihanna-asap-rocky-celebrate-christmas-barbados/" target="_blank">People</a> about the new couple. The source went on to share that Rihanna and A$AP's common interest of investing in their communities bonded them on a deeper level. "Rihanna seems very happy dating A$AP," the source concluded.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Shortly after the official announcement that Rihanna and A$AP Rocky were an item, the two were seen traveling to Rihanna's home island of Barbados for Christmas in 2020. Their trip was made picture-perfect, with a sunset Catamaran tour and family bonding. "Rihanna has been in Barbados since [last] Thursday," a source told <a href="https://people.com/music/rihanna-asap-rocky-celebrate-christmas-barbados/" target="_blank">People</a> at the time. "A$AP joined her and they are spending Christmas together with Rihanna's family."</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>

The rapper revealed that his own father emigrated to the United States from Barbados, and the trip with Rihanna opened his eyes to a whole new aspect of his life. "It was like a homecoming thing," he revealed. "I always imagined what it would be like for my dad, before he came to America. And I got to visit those places, and believe it or not, there was something nostalgic about it. It was foreign but familiar."</p>

<p dir="ltr">For two people that have mega-stardom both as individuals and as a couple, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky were able to keep their relationship surprisingly on the down low. They are not the kind of couple to post about each other all the time or make statements to news outlets on a whim — a move which made A$AP's words about his love interest that much more meaningful. In an extensive interview with <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/asap-rocky-june-july-2021-cover" target="_blank">GQ</a>, the rapper opened up about his relationship with Rihanna and did not mince his words. Simply calling her his "lady," A$AP was "beaming like a teenager" when talking about the Fenty creator and described her as the "love of [his] life." Can you hear our hearts melting?</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">When asked if Rihanna made his life infinitely better, A$AP did not hesitate. "So much better," he said, adding that everything in life is improved when you've found "the One." "I think when you know, you know. She's the One," he said emphatically. Queried about Rihanna's impact on his music, A$AP revealed, "I think it's important to have somebody that you can bounce those creative juices and ideas off of."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rihanna has made it clear throughout her professional life that she's not here for games — the Fenty creator and Grammy Award winner has always kept a low personal profile, but she opened up to <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/rihanna-new-album-vogue-interview" target="_blank">Vogue</a> about the possibility of having children. "Since I turned 32, I'm realizing life is really short," she said. When asked about the next decade of her life, the songstress shared that <a href="https://www.thelist.com/198041/heres-how-many-kids-rihanna-wants/" target="_blank">she wanted "three or four" kids</a> and said she'd be happy to do it on her own. "Hell, yeah," she said at the notion. "I feel like society ... They diminish you as a mother if there's not a dad in your kids' lives. But the only thing that matters is happiness."</p>

<p dir="ltr">As for A$AP Rocky, he, too, opened up separately about having children one day and did not hold back with <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/asap-rocky-june-july-2021-cover" target="_blank">GQ</a>. "If that's in my destiny, absolutely," he responded to the question about one day becoming a father. "I think I'd be an incredible, remarkably, overall amazing dad. I would have a very fly child. Very."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Even before they were romantically involved with one another, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky were known for making stunning red-carpet appearances (like the aforementioned British Fashion Awards in 2019). So, when the newly-minted couple graced the red carpet at the 2021 Met Gala, all eyes were on them. As noted by <a href="https://people.com/style/rihanna-met-gala-2021-outfit-details-red-carpet-photos/" target="_blank">People</a>, the looks — both individually and together — were jaw-dropping, and fans from every corner of the internet emerged to talk about the couple and the designer looks.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Though they may have been sourced from an inspiration of comfort, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky's looks did not disappoint. People noted that Rihanna's dress — a billowing, yet structured, ensemble — was a custom look adorned with a high neckline and flared hemline. She paired it with 267 carats of jewelry from Bulgari and with earrings and adornments from Thelma West and Maria Tash. A$AP's look was less descript, but he stunned fans with a quilt-inspired, multi-colored look that had everyone talking. No matter what you thought of the looks, the Met Gala proved that Rihanna and A$AP were a couple worth keeping an eye on.</p>

<p>Then, the couple found out that they were expecting their first baby! Rihanna told <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a39701388/how-rihanna-told-asap-rocky-pregnant/" target="_blank">Cosmopolitan</a> that the two weren't planning to have children or actively trying, they also weren't avoiding the possibility. After she explained that she didn't know when she ovulates, Rihanna revealed that she found out about the pregnancy just like the rest of us do.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>She said, "We just had fun. And then it was just there on the test. I didn't waste any time. I called him inside and showed him. Then I was in the doctor's office the next morning and our journey began."</p>
<p>They got creative when it was time for the couple to share the news with the world. On January 21, 2022, the "Diamonds" singer stepped out with her boyfriend, exposing her adorable baby bump in the most stylish way possible. As noted by <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/rihannas-pink-pregnancy-announcement-outfit-is-she-having-a-girl/" target="_blank">Us Weekly</a>, Rihanna's look was comprised of a vintage Chanel coat, jeans, and an adornment of jewels, but perhaps her best accessory was her adorable, exposed baby bump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the iconic photoshoot that captured the soon-to-be parents, A$AP was seen holding Rihanna close and kissing her forehead, further confirming that they might be our favorite celebrity couple. Shortly after the official announcement, Rihanna took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZfyFxOpIkF/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=963a1e14-5cd0-45bd-9c1f-d2a0e0da8243" class="hoverZoomLink" target="_blank">Instagram</a> to share a candid photo of her glowing self, captioning the pic, "How the gang pulled up to black history month." </p>

<p dir="ltr">It seems as though it was more than just the public surprised by Rihanna and A$AP Rocky's <a href="https://www.thelist.com/751972/rihanna-and-aap-rocky-have-exciting-family-news/" target="_blank">baby news</a>! As it turns out, the couple kept their little bundle of joy a secret from their friends and family — but not without difficulty. In an interview with <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1319587/rihanna-recalls-keeping-her-pregnancy-a-secret-from-her-friends" target="_blank">E! News</a>, Rihanna shared, "It was harder for me to keep it from my posse, because they're around me, they know my habits," she said. The singer revealed that her friends were curious why she wasn't drinking or smoking, and <em>why on earth</em> the sugar-hating businesswoman was turning to donuts. "I just had to let it all out, and they were all shocked, of course, as the world was shocked as well," she said.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">So, what was pregnancy like for the Fenty designer, mogul, and singer? Rihanna shared with E! News that her first trimester was full of shock, lessons, and trepidation. "When I first found out, it's not real, you know? ... It's almost like you don't want to get too excited too soon because it's great news, but ... now I can celebrate with everyone."</p>

<p dir="ltr">With all of their exciting baby news and preparations underway, it begs the question: Will we get new music from Rihanna <em>and</em> A$AP Rocky anytime soon? Given that we've been waiting for music from Rihanna for what feels like <em>ages,</em> the answer might surprise you. She told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/rihanna-says-being-pregnant-has-been-an-exciting-journey-so-far-exclusive-179240" target="_blank">Entertainment Tonight</a> that fans should expect new music from her and that it won't be anything to do with baby nursery rhymes or lullabies. "My fans would kill me if they waited this long for a lullaby," she joked.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">As for A$AP, he's teased new music for a while now and told <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/asap-rocky-june-july-2021-cover" target="_blank">GQ</a> in his May 2021 interview that his next album was very close to completion. In another interview with Showtime's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0jZzOW-YrE" target="_blank">DESUS &amp; MERO</a>," he elaborated, saying he's been "in the zone" and staying focused on his musical process. But, it seems as though baby news might be what's really on the forefront of A$AP's mind, as he told Entertainment Tonight, "I'm just excited for what I don't know yet. Everything is new to me. So, I'm excited."</p>

<p dir="ltr">When Rihanna stepped out in that electric pink coat, low-rise jeans, and delicate jewels, the one other accessory that had <em>everyone</em> talking was her baby bump. The pregnancy announcement that quite literally stopped people in their tracks had the Fenty Beauty founder's growing bump on full display, and it marked the beginning of one of the most fashion-forward and poignant pregnancy wardrobes in modern history. As media studies professor Liza Tsaliki told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/style/rihanna-pregnancy-fashion.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, Rihanna's maternity wardrobe didn't consist of oversized t-shirts, big dresses, and sweatpants; rather, her bump-defining statement pieces, designer ensembles, and expectation-defying looks are fulfilling a "totally transgressive and highly political statement." So how does A$AP Rocky play into all of this? As it turns out, the couple inspires one another's fashion choices.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">During an extensive interview with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/rihanna-cover-may-2022" target="_blank">Vogue</a>, Rihanna opened up about her fashion risk-taking and told the storied publication that she and Rocky challenge each other's aesthetics, "Like iron sharpening iron." As such, her poignant maternity looks are only supported by her partner. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Perhaps one of the worst aspects of being in the public eye, we can imagine, is having falsified rumors about you spread like wildfire — and in April 2022, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky were subjected to a horrible, potentially life-altering lie that hit the tabloids almost instantaneously. Here's what went down.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Writer Louis Pisano took to Twitter with an unsubstantiated rumor that Rocky had cheated on a pregnant Rihanna with designer Amina Muaddi. Given that Rocky didn't break his silence or weigh in with his two cents, the rumor set light to some very dry pop culture kindling. The next day, <a href="https://twitter.com/AminaMuaddi/status/1515009789176156160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1515009789176156160%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeople.com%2Fmusic%2Fdesigner-amina-muaddi-slams-asap-rocky-rihanna-cheating-accusations%2F" target="_blank">Muaddi took to Twitter</a> herself and completely denied the allegations, calling the falsified story "an unfounded lie." "I initially assumed that this fake gossip — fabricated with such malicious intent — would not be taken seriously," the designer posted. "However in the last 24h I've been reminded that we live in a society that is so quick to speak on topics regardless of factual basis and that nothing is off limits." Muaddi went on to praise Rihanna and her barrier-breaking pregnancy and wished everyone a happy Easter holiday.</p>

<p>Rihanna and A$AP Rocky then welcomed their first child together on May 13, 2022. An insider close to the couple told <a href="https://people.com/parents/rihanna-in-awe-of-baby-boy-barely-leaves-his-side-source-exlcusive/" target="_blank">People</a> that at the time the two were focused on soaking in their first moments of being parents. The source said, "Being a new parent is of course an adjustment, but they are doing great. Their baby boy is healthy and Rihanna is just in awe of him." They added, "Rihanna barely leaves his side. She is a fantastic mom."</p>

<p>But they weren't quick to share their new little one with the world. In fact, it took the couple seven months to give fans a glimpse of their adorable son. In mid-December, Rihanna used her TikTok profile to reveal the baby in all of his giggling glory. However, the baby's name still hadn't been revealed to the public. Rihanna told the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/66w7ZGvEKvU" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>, "We just didn't get around to it yet, really. We just been living." </p>

<p>While Rihanna and A$AP Rocky aren't married — at least, they haven't confirmed if they are. The two are notoriously private, but they have certainly hinted that marriage might be in their future. In fact, A$AP Rocky made a big splash when he dropped his video for "D.M.B.", which was essentially one giant ode to the woman carrying his child. As reported by <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/asap-rocky-rihanna-dmb-video" target="_blank">Vogue</a>, A$AP Rocky flashes a set of grills that spells out "marry me" and Rihanna, who is also wearing a red veil, showcases her own diamond-encrusted set that reads "I do." </p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>Of course, true to form, the pair didn't comment on the video or the grills themselves. They also certainly did not add their own thoughts to the speculation that soon surrounded their relationship status. The video is also packed with a few other lovey-dovey scenes that appear to show the two celebrating an engagement or partying in some way.</p>

<p>Rihanna performed at the Super Bowl's halftime show in January 2023, and she used the performance as an opportunity to make a major announcement. She and A$AP Rocky were expecting their second baby together. Rihanna showed off her growing baby bump after unzipping the red jumpsuit she wore. She also rubbed her belly throughout her performance, and a representative for the couple confirmed the news to several outlets following the show.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>Rihanna similarly announced her first pregnancy in a surprising fashion, taking photographs in New York City with her boyfriend. A friend close to the couple told <a href="https://people.com/parents/super-bowl-2023-rihanna-reveals-shes-pregnant-with-second-baby-during-super-bowl-halftime-show/" target="_blank">People</a> at the time, "Everything Rihanna does, she does it her own way on her own timetable, and having a baby is no different. They're just like any other pair of parents-to-be. Yes, they happen to be famous, but they're just the cutest, giddiest young couple that's expecting kids."</p>

                    					<p>
<p>If you ask A$AP Rocky, it's not surprising that he and Rihanna are together and doing so well. While speaking to <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/56145/1/asap-rocky-rihanna-gucci-fatherhood" target="_blank">Dazed &amp; Confused Magazine</a>, the rapper opened up about what makes them work. He said, "I think it's just natural. We happen to look good together naturally. You know, it would take a lot of work to have us forcefully match before we leave the house. Sometimes we match to a T, or we just wear the same clothes. If I buy a shirt that she likes, I expect to get it stolen... but then I gotta steal it back."</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>A$AP Rocky also spoke about having and raising children with the "Umbrella" singer and made it clear that he is approaching parenthood with an open mind, just as he hopes his own children approach the world in the same way. While he's quick to point out that he's not trying to be perfect or raise perfect people, he hopes that their child will grow up to be "a cool child with cool parents." It's safe to say that the family is definitely well on their way.</p>

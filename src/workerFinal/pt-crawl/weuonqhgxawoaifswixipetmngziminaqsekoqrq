<td>Able to think, unable to move.  The mind trapped within the body.  
That is how people with <font color=red>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS)</font> describe their condition.  Their thinking abilities 
including memory are working, but their bodies will not respond to 
commands from the brain to move. ALS is also called "Lou Gehrig's 
Disease" after the famous baseball player who died of the disorder in 
1941. The <a href = 
"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS-Fact-Sheet">National 
Institutes of Health</A> estimates that there are 14,000-15,000 people 
in the United States with ALS.  The <a 
href="http://www.alsa.org/about-als/facts-you-should-know.html">ALS 
Association</a> estimates that there are 15 new cases of ALS are 
diagnosed every day.<P> ALS is caused when certain neurons in the motor 
cortex and spinal cord die.  These neurons control voluntary muscles and 
the ability to move.  As these neurons die, a person may become weak and 
paralyzed.  ALS is <strong>not</strong> contagious, but it may run in 
families.<p>

There are several drugs to treat the symptoms of ALS, but there is no cure
and the cause of this disorder is still unknown.  Research published in
the journal <i>Neurology</i> (January 2000) suggests that a virus may be
responsible for ALS.

<tr><td>Scientists in the US, France and Austria collaborated to examine 
the spinal cords of people who died with ALS and those from a control 
group of people who died of other causes.  The researchers were interested 
to see if the spinal cord tissue from those people with ALS was infected 
with an <font color=red>enterovirus</font>.  When the data were analyzed, 
the virus was found in the tissue from 15 of 17 patients (88.3%) who had 
ALS, but in the tissue of only 1 of 29 control patients (3.4%). <P>

These data suggest a link between the enterovirus and ALS.  However, still 
unknown is how the virus gets into neurons and whether the presence of the 
virus is the cause of the disease or a result of the disease.  If further 
research determines that the virus is a cause of ALS, then it is possible 
that anti-viral therapies could be developed to fight this disorder.<p>

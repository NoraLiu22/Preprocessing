    <td align="left" valign="top"><p><span class="speaker">Robert Oxnam ::</span> The question is often raised as to whether or not Confucian thought should be considered "religious."</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Irene Bloom :: </span> As Confucianism is understood in the West, it often seems to come with a little tag attached saying, "This is philosophical and not religious." Which raises some very interesting questions about the nature of religion. What constitutes religion?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Wm. Theodore de Bary ::</span> According to Western conceptions of religion, primarily based upon the prophetic traditions of the Old and New Testament, or the Koran, certainly Confucianism is not a religion.</p>
      <p>But nevertheless, Confucius has a very, very strong sense of reverence towards heaven, which is not distinguishable from a reverence towards life. You have a reverence towards life, and heaven is the source of life.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Irene Bloom ::</span> Confucius also draws on the
        authority of Heaven. The Chinese word, <i>tian</i>, can actually be translated
        either as heaven or as nature. But it has a sense of a moral order existing
        in the world, which governs all of human life and all of the processes of
        the natural world at the same time. Confucius says at one point, "Heaven
        gave birth to the power that is in me&quot; &#8212; the power or the virtue
        that is in me. He seems to regard heaven as overseeing his life and the
        lives of others and overseeing, also, the cause of culture, so that there's
        a certain confidence here.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="right" class="explanatory">[Excerpt from the <i>Analects</i> of Confucius] </p>
        <p class="explanatory">Confucius said: "I wish I did not have to speak at all." </p>
        <p class="explanatory">Zi Gong said: "But if you did not speak, Sir, what should we disciples pass on to others?" </p>
        <p class="explanatory">Confucius said: "Look at Heaven there. Does it speak? The four seasons run their course and all things are produced. Does Heaven speak?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="speaker">Irene Bloom ::</span> Heaven does not speak, human beings have to discover the ways, the patterns, the order of heaven as it works out in the larger world of society and in their own lives.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Wm. Theodore de Bary ::</span> So what I would say
        is that Confucius and Confucianism have a very strong religious dimension,
        but they pretty much assume that the basics of religion are already given
        in the pre-existing tradition.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Robert Oxnam ::</span> This pre-existing tradition
        assumed that there is a cosmic order and that it is moral. Furthermore, this
        moral order was assumed to extend through the cosmos at every level &#8212; in
        heaven, on earth, and in human society.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Myron Cohen ::</span> The point is that these were
        not distinguished as separate domains, but as interconnected domains. It's
        this holistic interconnected, cosmic, integrated, entire view that I think
        is a fundamental characteristic of Chinese thought and Chinese belief in
        general, such that Confucianism fits into it.</p>
      <p>For example, the basic Confucian ideas of filial piety &#8212; that children
        must be loyal and obedient to their parents, show them respect in life and
        reverence after they have died  &#8212; these are not simply ethical ideas.
        These were ethical ideas given, if you will, cosmic validation. That a son
        should be respectful of his father was seen to be as much a part of nature
        as the rising and setting of the sun. So that ethical relationships were
        thought to be natural relationships.</p>
      <p>Therefore, violating an ethical relationship would seem to be violating
        nature itself. The sanctions were natural, not supernatural, because in effect,
        you were causing disorder in the cosmos by violating ethical relationships.
        And this notion of the cosmos as containing important human relationships,
        as well as relationships and phenomena which we in the West might consider
        to be part of nature and distinct from human relationships, extended to
        many, many areas of thinking in China.</p>
      <p align="center" class="title">* * * </p>
      <p class="explanatory">The Chinese word for heaven or nature, tian, is pronounced tee-en with stress on the second syllable. In the character, the lower part is a character that by itself means "big." Adding the line on top is said to indicate that nothing is bigger than heaven.</p>

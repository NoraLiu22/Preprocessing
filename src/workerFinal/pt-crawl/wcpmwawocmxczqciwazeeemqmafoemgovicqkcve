<a href="Index.htm">James Hayes-Bohanan, Ph.D.</a></h3>
What is cybertheology doing on a geography web site? First, because it
happens to interest this geographer. More importantly, geographers
cannot
afford to ignore the ways in which the internet in general and the
worldwide
web in particular are reshaping spatial relationships. I certainly view
the world in a much different way than I did just a few years ago, and
I think most people who use the web would agree. The web also raises
important
equity issues, as physical location is superceded in some ways by
proximity
to the web itself. In 1996 I had the <a
 href="http://webhost.bridgew.edu/jhayesboh/folha1.htm">unusual
experience</a> of being in Porto Velho, Brazil, just as a few elites in
that remote city were getting online. I think the same disparities
exist
in even the most-wired cities of the U.S.
<p>These notes began in connection with a discussion I led at the First
Parish Church, Unitarian Universalist, Bridgewater, Massachusetts. My
interest
in the meaning of the web, which began with Teilhard, continues to grow
and to lead me to a variety of new ideas. Many thanks to my friend,
librarian,and
fellow net-head <a href="http://www.gslis.utexas.edu/%7Elucas">Luke
Rosenberger</a>
both for the idea and for much of of what appears below.
</p>
<h3>Teilhard</h3>
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) was a geologist, anthropologist,
and Jesuit priest.
<p>The following is a cyberbibliography of works related (some more
directly
than others) to Teilhard's theories on evolution as they relate to the
world wide web. You may also find a number of books on the work and
life
of Teilhard in the <a href="http://www.bridgew.edu/library/">Bridgewater
State College Library</a>.

Teilhard's work also reminded my friend Luke a lot of another mystic,
the
Nicaraguan poet-priest (and later minister of culture during the
Sandinista
years) Ernesto Cardenal. While he was at at the Trappist monastery in
Gethsemane,
Kentucky in the late 50s he wrote a work called <i>Vida en el amor, </i>published
by Ediciones Nicarao in Nicaragua. One English translation <i>To live
is
to love</i> was published in 1972 by Herder &amp; Herder and another, <i>Abide
in love</i>, was published in 1995 by Orbis and is available through <a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>:
<a

<p>Oddly enough, the main character in Mike Liegh's 1993 film noir <a

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<a href="http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/980706.atc.07.ram">EMOTIONAL
COMPUTERS</a><font size="-1">
(Requires <a href="http://www.npr.org/inside/realaudio.html">RealAudio</a>)</font>
-- Commentator <b>David Weinberger</b> talks about the idea that
computers
can be built to mimic human emotions. He says that they are already
emotional,
because of how the computer desktop metaphor has become a distinct and
identifiable place. It is now perceived as a place computer users
actually
go. Since places bring forth emotions, the computer is already an
emotional
tool. (3:00 minutes - NPR's All Things Considered, Monday, July 6,
1998)
<p>If you really want to stretch your imagination, consider Tielhard's
ideas in relation to the recent developments in DNA-based calculation.
For the past 20 years or so, the speed of computers has doubled every
18
months. Most experts agree, however, that this trend will reach a
physical
barrier in another decade or so. That is, silicon-based calculators
will
reach their physical limits at around that time. So researchers are
considering
other materials, and DNA seems a strong possibility, since it already
transmits
such incredibly vast amounts of data. Visit Yali Friedman's paper, "<a
 href="http://www.clearlight.com/%7Emorph/dna/dne.htm">Everyone'sGuide
to DNA Computers</a>," if you want to learn more about this endeavor.
The
relevance to Tielhard, I think, is that the continued evolution of
non-living
"intelligent" systems will reach a threshold that might only be
surpassed
with the use of computational materials from living systems.So the line
dividing organic minds from inorganic might become increasingly
blurred.

<h3><a name="evolution"></a>Evolution</h3>
<i><a href="http://www4.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/" target="body">Evolution's
Arrow</a>: The Direction of Evolution and the Future of Humanity</i> by
John Stewart has been published in Australia and is available online
until
can be published elsewhere. Stewart argues that evolution is
directional
and progressive, and that this has major consequences for humanity. It
argues that evolution moves in the direction of producing cooperative
organisations
of greater scale and evolvability - evolution has organised molecular
processes
into cells, cells into organisms, and organisms into societies. The
book
founds this position on a new theory of the evolution of cooperation.
It
shows how self-interest at the level of genes and individuals does not
stand in the way of the movement of evolution toward increasing
cooperation.
Evolution progresses by discovering ways to build cooperative
organisations
out of self-interested individuals. <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font

<p>Stanford linguist Geoffrey Nunberg's essay "<a
 href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/members/nunberg/portal.html">How
the Web Was Won</a>" appeared on NPR's Fresh Air November 9, 1998. In
the
essay, he explores how the language we use to describe the Internet is
changing. He also delves into the meaning of some new spatial metaphors
now current on the web, such as "portal" and "hub."
</p>
<p>The <a
 href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/City_of_Bits/index.html">City
of Bits Web</a> site was created in the spring and summer of 1995 as
the
first full-text interactive book on the World Wide Web. It is a
comprehensive
introduction to a new type of city, a largely invisible but
increasingly
important system of virtual spaces interconnected by the emerging
information
superhighway. William Mitchell makes extensive use of concrete,
practical
examples and illustrations in a technically well-grounded yet
accessible
examination of architecture and urbanism in the context of the digital
telecommunications revolution, the ongoing miniaturization of
electronics,the
commodification of bits, and the growing domination of software
over-materialized
form. Chapter 5, <a
 href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/City_of_Bits/Soft_Cities/index.html">Soft
Cities</a>, is particularly rich in its exploration of the geographic
implicationsof
what I call New Space.
</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most intriguing geographic developments on the
web
is the emergence of a cottage industry in top-level domain names. The
most
extreme example is Tuvalu, a Pacific Island nation that would receive
little
notice on the Internet were it not for the domain name it has been
assigned:.tv.
A 1998 <a
 href="http://www.techserver.com/newsroom/ntn/info/101598/info2_26407_noframes.html">Reuters
article</a> describes the effort to capitalize on this name. The
Canadianconcern
that is directing the enterprise (and collecting a share of any
profits)
is <a href="http://www.internet.tv">internet.tv</a>. So far, sales
have
been zero, perhaps because of the high fee internet.tv is charging for
this modern-day flag of convenience. For a complete list of TLDs

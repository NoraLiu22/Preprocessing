        <p>They say we have been here for 40 000 years, but it is much longer. <img style="float:right;margin-left:24px" alt="Man - Earth" src="images/man_earth.gif" width="344" height="238"></p>
            <p>
            We have been here since time began We have come directly out of the 
            Dreamtime of our creative ancestors. </p>
            <p>We have kept the earth as it was on the first day.<br>
            
            Our culture is focused on recording the origins of life. </p>
            <p>
            We refer to forces and powers that created the world as creative ancestors. 
            </p>
            <p>Our beautiful world has been created only in accordance with the power, 
            wisdom and intentions of our ancestral beings. </p>
            
            
            
            
     <!--       
            <p>According to Aboriginal belief, all life as it is today - Human, 
                    Animal, Bird and Fish is part of one vast unchanging network of 
                    relationships which can be traced to the great spirit ancestors 
                    of the Dreamtime. </p>
    
                    
<p>
                During the creation of our world, the ancestors moved across a barren 
                land, hunting, camping, fighting and loving and in doing so shaped 
                a featureless landscape. </p>
                <p>Moving from Dreams to actions, the ancestors made the ants, the emus, 
                the crows, the possums, the wallabies, the kangaroos, the lizard, 
                the goanna, the snakes and all the food and plants. </p>
                <p>They made the sun, the moon and the planets. They made the humans, 
                tribes and clans. </p>
                <p>Each could transform into the other. A plant could become an animal, 
                an animal a landform, a landform a man or a woman. </p>
<p>Everything was created from the same source. </p>
                <p>Everything was created in our Dreamtime. </p>
                <p>As the world took shape and was filled with species and varieties 
                of the ancestral tranformations, the ancestors tired and retired 
                into: </p>
                  <ul>
					  <li><i style="font-size:15px" class="fa fa-dot-circle-o"></i> the earth</li>
					  <li><i style="font-size:15px" class="fa fa-dot-circle-o"></i> the sky</li>
					  <li><i style="font-size:15px" class="fa fa-dot-circle-o"></i> the clouds</li>
					  <li><i style="font-size:15px" class="fa fa-dot-circle-o"></i> and the creatures to live within all their created
					  </li>
					  <li><i style="font-size:15px" class="fa fa-dot-circle-o"></i> in our Dreamtime</li>
	</ul>
	
	                <p>The Dreamtime continues as the "Dreaming" in the spiritual 
                    lives of aboriginal people today. The events of the ancient era 
                    of creation are enacted in ceremonies and danced in mime form. 
                    Song chant incessantly to the accompaniment of the didgeridoo 
                    or clap sticks relates the story of events of those early times 
                    and brings to the power of the dreaming to bear of life today.</p>

                <h2>The Sacred World</h2>
                
                    <p>The Dreamtime is the Aboriginal understanding 
                    of the world, of it's creation, and it's great stories. The Dreamtime 
                    is the beginning of knowledge, from which came the laws of existence. 
                    For survival these laws must be observed. </p><div style="float:right;margin-left:12px;font-size:12px;text-align:center"><img alt="Dreamtime painting by Norbett Lynch" src="images/painting.jpg" height="352" width="260"><br>
                 Dreamtime painting by Norbett Lynch</div>
                    

                    <p>The Dreaming world was the old time of the Ancestor Beings. They 
                    emerged from the earth at the time of the creation. Time began 
                    in the world the moment these supernatural beings were "born 
                    out of their own Eternity". </p>
                    
                    <p>The Earth was a flat surface, in darkness. A dead, silent world. 
                    Unknown forms of life were asleep, below the surface of the land. 
                    Then the supernatural Ancestor Beings broke through the crust 
                    of the earth form below , with tumultuous force. </p>
                    
                    <p>The sun rose out of the ground. The land received light for the 
                    first time. The supernatural Beings, or Totemic Ancestors, resembled creatures or 
                plants, and were half human. They moved across the barren surface 
                of the world. They travelled hunted and fought, and changed the form 
                of the land. In their journeys, they created the landscape, the mountains, 
                the rivers, the trees, waterholes, plains and sandhills. They made 
                the people themselves, who are descendants of the Dreamtime ancestors. 
                They made the Ant, Grasshopper, Emu, Eagle, Crow, Parrot, Wallaby, 
                Kangaroo, Lizard, Snake, and all food plants. They made the natural 
                elements : Water, Air, Fire. They made all the celestial bodies : 
                the Sun, the Moon and the Stars. Then, wearied from all their activity, 
                the mythical creatures sank back into the earth and returned to their 
                state of sleep.</p>
                <p> Sometimes their spirits turned into rocks or trees or a part of the 
                landscape. These became sacred places, to be seen only by initiated 
                men. These sites had special qualities. </p>
            <h2>The Physical World</h2>
                  <h4>"<em> OUR LAND OUR LIFE </em>"</h4>
                  <p>
                  <b>
              <img alt="Our Land Our Life" style="float:right;margin-left:12px" src="images/ourland.jpg" height="255" width="385">'<em>We don't own the land, the land owns us</em>' </b><br>
                  <br>
                  <b>'<em>The Land is my mother, my mother is the land</em>' </b><br>
                  <br>
                  <b>'<em>Land is the starting point to where it all began. It is like picking 
                    up a piece of dirt and saying this is where I started and this is 
                    where I will go</em>' <br>
                  <br>
                    '<em>The land is our food, our culture, our spirit and identity</em>' <br>
                    <br>
                    '<em>We don't have boundaries like fences, as farmers do. We have spiritual 
                    connections</em>'</b> </p> 
              <p>Land means many things to many people. To a farmer, land is a means of 
                production and the source of a way of life. It is economic sustainability. 
                To a property developer, it is a bargaining chip and the means of 
                financial progress and success. To many Australians, land is something 
                they can own if they work hard enough and save enough money to buy 
                it. To Indigenous people land is not just something that they can 
                own or trade. Land has a spiritual value. </p>
           <h2>The Human World</h2>
                <p>We are the Indigenous people of Australia. Aboriginal 
                people are those traditional cultures and lands lie on the mainland 
                and most of the islands, including Tasmania, Fraser Island, Palm 
                Island, Mornington Island, Groote Eylandt, Bathrust and Melville 
                Islands. The term "Aboriginal" has become one of the most 
                disputed in the Australian language. </p>
                <p>The Commonwealth definition is social more than racial, in keeping 
                with the change in Australian attitudes away from racialistic thinking 
                about other people. An Aboriginal person is defined as a person 
                who is a descendant of an Indigenous inhabitant of Australia, identifies 
                as an Aboriginal, and is recognised as Aboriginal by members of 
                the community in which she or he lives. </p>
                <p>This definition is preferred by the vast majority of our people 
                over the racial definitions of the assimilation era. Administration 
                of the definition, at least by the Commonwealth for the purposes 
                of providing grants or loans, requires that an applicant present 
                a certificate of Aboriginality issued by an incorporated Aboriginal 
                body under its common seal. </p>
                
           <p style="text-align:center"><img alt="gathering" src="images/gathering.gif" height="285" width="547"></p>
             


               <p>Sometimes non-Aboriginal people get confused by the great range 
                and variety of Aboriginal and Torres Strait people, from the traditional 
                hunter to the Doctor of Philosophy; from the dark-skinned to the 
                very fair; from the speaker of traditional languages to the radio 
                announcer who speaks the Queen's English. The lesson to be learned 
                from this is that we should not stereotype people ; that people 
                are different, regardless of race. </p>
                <p>Our people, of course, did not use the word "Aborigene" 
                (from the latin ab, origin meaning "from the beginning" 
                to refer to ourselves before the coming of non-Aborigenes. Everyone 
                was simply a person.

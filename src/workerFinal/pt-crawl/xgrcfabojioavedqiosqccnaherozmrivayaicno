(&ldquo;Defendant&rdquo; or &ldquo;EA&rdquo;) to dismiss Plaintiff Ryan Hart's Second Amended Complaint (&ldquo;Plaintiff&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hart&rdquo;) pursuant to <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-iii-pleadings-and-motions/rule-12-defenses-and-objections-when-and-how-presented-motion-for-judgment-on-the-pleadings-consolidating-motions-waiving-defenses-pretrial-hearing" class="raw-ref">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)</a>, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment pursuant to <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)</a>. The allegations giving rise to Plaintiff's putative class action lawsuit stem from Defendant's purported misappropriation of the likeness and identity of Plaintiff, a former college football athlete, as well as those similarly situated, for a commercial purpose in connection with four of Defendant's NCAA Football video games. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's claims under New Jersey law for misappropriation of his likeness, which claims the Court treats as a single right of publicity claim, are barred by the First Amendment. For the reasons set forth below, the Court treats Plaintiff's motion as one for summary judgment. The Court, further agrees that, on balance, on the facts of this case, Defendant's First Amendment right to free expression outweighs Plaintiff's right of publicity. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment. </p> <h3>I.

Additionally, users with an Internet connection can modify entire teams by downloading custom rosters that have been created and uploaded by video game consumers, including a section of EA's website called Teambuilder. Second Am. Compl. at 59. Some rosters available on these websites seek to replicate actual current and former football team rosters. <i>See </i> <i>id.</i> at 59&ndash;61.    </p><div note-container="1" id="N196646"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="13" id="pa13">Plaintiff failed to comply with Local <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Rule 56</a>. 1, which requires a response to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute to be filed.

In that complaint, on behalf of himself and similarly situated athletes, Plaintiff asserted, among other claims, that Defendant had violated his right of publicity based on its use of Plaintiff's likeness as a virtual player on the Rutgers University football team in EA's 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2009 editions of <i>NCAA Football.</i> <a note-disclosure="4" href="#N196702"></a> First Am.

In connection with its motion to dismiss, EA attached copies of the video games for the Court's review since the games were referenced in Hart's initial complaint. In arguing for dismissal of the right of publicity claim, EA contended that Plaintiff's claim failed as a matter of law under both New Jersey state law and the First Amendment. <i>See</i> Docket. No. 8 at 10&ndash;23. Moreover, EA argued that Plaintiff had not stated a claim for right of publicity because the First Amended Complaint did not identify the attributes of Plaintiff that had been incorporated into the <i>NCAA Football</i> games. <i>Id.</i> at 11. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="20" id="pa20">Plaintiff submitted a brief in opposition to EA's motion to dismiss, as well as a Declaration. Both submissions averred misappropriation of specific attributes of Plaintiff into EA's <i>NCAA Football</i> games. <i>See</i> Court's Sept. 22, 2010 Opinion, Docket No. 23 (&ldquo;Court's Opinion&rdquo;), <a href="/case/hart-v-electronic-arts-2#p660" class="raw-ref">740 F.Supp.2d 658 at 660&ndash;62</a> (D.N.J.2010). In his Declaration, Plaintiff asserted that the disputed games depicted a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; player that had been designed to replicate Plaintiff's physical attributes, as well as his football skills. <i>Id.</i> at 660&ndash;62. Further, Plaintiff contended that Defendant had used video footage of him playing in a Rutgers University Football game &ldquo;in promotion for ... EA's NCAA game.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 661. Plaintiff described Defendant's games as allowing consumers &ldquo;to simulate the college football playing experience by stepping into the shoes of Rutgers' QB Ryan Hart, and other college football players, where fans can mimic Plaintiff's style and movements and play against Plaintiff's actual opponents.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 662 (citation omitted). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="21" id="pa21">On September 22, 2010, the Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint with prejudice on all counts with the exception of Plaintiff's right of publicity claim, which it dismissed without prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 668, 671. The Court determined that it could not consider allegations presented by Plaintiff outside of its pleadings on a motion to dismiss, and subsequently determined that because the First Amended Complaint did not contain allegations &ldquo;as to what aspects of [Plaintiff's] likeness [were] appropriated&rdquo; by EA, the Court was unable to decide, as a matter of law, whether Plaintiff could state a right of publicity claim under New Jersey law. <i>Id.</i> at 662&ndash;63, 664&ndash;65. Nonetheless, the Court did undertake an analysis of New Jersey right of publicity law as it related to the facts alleged in Plaintiff's Declaration and opposition brief, and found that the allegations &ldquo;appear to state a right of publicity claim under New Jersey law.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 665. Thus, the Court granted Plaintiff's request for an opportunity to amend his Complaint for the second time, and informed EA that the Court would consider its First Amendment defense if Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint. <i>Id.</i> at 664&ndash;65. <b>C. <i>Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint</i> </b> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="22" id="pa22">On October 12, 2010, Plaintiff filed his Second Amended Complaint (&ldquo;Complaint&rdquo;), in which he alleges that EA violated his right of publicity under New Jersey law by misappropriating and incorporating his identity and likeness for a commercial <span page-number="763" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p763"></span> purpose in connection with EA's video games. <a note-disclosure="5" href="#N196767"></a> As discussed herein, Plaintiff incorporated the proposed allegations that the Court addressed in its September 22, 2010 Opinion. The Complaint states that Hart's likeness is found in <i>NCAA Football 2004, NCAA Football 2005, NCAA Football 2006,</i> and <i>NCAA Football 2009,</i> in violation of his right of publicity. <i>See</i> Second Am.

Compl. at 48. According to Plaintiff, video game consumers demand that these games &ldquo;simulate actual college football matches in the most realistic manner possible, including the use of the &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; players that are modeled after real-life NCAA Football players such as [Plaintiff].&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> Further, in regards to the users' ability to upload and download team rosters with names of real-life players, Plaintiff, while not alleging that EA has itself made this information available, does fault EA for &ldquo;tak[ing] no courses of action to prevent&rdquo; users from uploading rosters that use real players' names without authorization. <i>Id.</i> at 59&ndash;63.

ANALYSIS</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="37" id="pa37">For the purposes of this motion, Defendant concedes that Plaintiff has stated a prima facie right of publicity claim under New Jersey law. Mot. at 1. Despite this concession, in its moving papers, EA expresses disagreement with statements of New Jersey law made in this Court's September 22, 2010 Opinion. In that opinion, which granted EA's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for failure to sufficiently plead a right of publicity claim under New Jersey law, the Court interpreted New Jersey's right of publicity law and concluded that Hart's proposed allegations &ldquo;appear[ed] to state a right of publicity claim under New Jersey law.&rdquo; Court's Opinion at 665. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="38" id="pa38">To the extent that some of EA's comments suggest that the Court's interpretation of New Jersey case law is inconsistent with First Amendment principles, EA misreads the September 22nd Opinion.<a note-disclosure="7" href="#N196986"></a> That <span page-number="767" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p767"></span> opinion focused on the scope of New Jersey's right of publicity claim as expressed by state and federal New Jersey decisional law at that time. The opinion did <i>not</i> address the scope of federal constitutional principles that might affect a New Jersey court's interpretation of such a claim. Rather, the Court dismissed Hart's complaint and granted him leave to amend. In so doing, the Court provided an overview of New Jersey's right of publicity law in ascertaining whether granting leave to amend would be futile. The Court was careful to explain that, in granting Hart leave to amend, &ldquo;the Court is not holding that Plaintiff's proposed allegations are sufficient as a matter of law. Rather, the Court merely concludes that the sort of allegations Plaintiff proposes suggest that an amendment may not be futile.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 668. Without a fully articulated amended complaint before it, the Court chose not to define the precise contours of the misappropriation doctrine, including all potential interpretive effects of First Amendment doctrine.<a note-disclosure="8" href="#N197003"></a>   </p><div note-container="7" id="N196986"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="39" id="pa39">For example, in footnote 12 of its moving brief, EA takes issue with this Court's discussion of <i>Castro v. NYT Television,</i> <a href="/case/castro-v-nyt-television#p296" class="raw-ref">370 N.J.Super. 282, 296</a>, <a href="/case/castro-v-nyt-television" class="raw-ref">851 A.2d 88</a> (App.Div.2004), which held that a right of publicity claim could not be lodged by patrons at the emergency room of a public hospital who were videotaped and, later, shown on a reality-based television program. As explained in the opinion, EA relied upon the following language from <i>Castro,</i> to argue that <i>NCAA Football</i> was entitled to First Amendment protection: &ldquo;it is irrelevant whether a videotape is broadcast in connection with a television story about important public events or a subject that provides only entertainment and amusement....&rdquo; <a href="/case/castro-v-nyt-television#p298" class="raw-ref">370 N.J.Super. at 298</a>, <a href="/case/castro-v-nyt-television" class="raw-ref">851 A.2d 88</a>. Def. Mov. Br. on Mot. to Dismiss at 13. <br> <i>Castro</i> did not discuss the First Amendment in its analysis of the plaintiffs' claim in that case, however. Rather, <i>Castro</i> held that the plaintiffs in that case failed to &ldquo;allege that any of the videotape footage taken of them ... has been used for &lsquo;trade purposes&rdquo; and, therefore, that the &ldquo;plaintiffs' complaints [did] not state causes of action for commercial appropriation of their likenesses.&rdquo; <a href="/case/castro-v-nyt-television#p298" class="raw-ref">370 N.J.Super. at 298</a>, <a href="/case/castro-v-nyt-television" class="raw-ref">851 A.2d 88</a>. EA now takes issue with the Court's comment in the September 22nd Opinion that cases interpreting <i>Castro</i> have limited its holding to news-related entities. Court's Opinion at 667&ndash;68 (discussing <i>Liebholz v. Harriri,</i> Civil Action No. 05&ndash;5148, 2006 WL 2023186 (D.N.J. Jul. 12, 2006)). Reading that comment out of context, EA argues that <i>Castro,</i> and other cases discussed by this Court in that opinion, do not stand for the proposition that the First Amendment distinguishes between media and non-media defendants. Read in context, it is clear that this Court was not discussing the First Amendment nor opining on whether a ruling that distinguishes between media and non-media defendants would be appropriate. Indeed, the paragraph following the Court's discussion of how <i>Castro's</i> holding has been interpreted explains that the &ldquo;the touchstone of the <i>commercial purpose requirement</i> is whether the publication uses the plaintiff's likeness &lsquo;for the purpose of capitalizing upon the name by using it in connection with a commercial project....&rsquo; &rdquo; Court's Opinion at 667&ndash;68 (emphasis added). For EA to now argue that the Court suggested that &ldquo; &lsquo;non-media&rsquo; expressive speech is entitled to less First Amendment protection than &lsquo;media&rsquo; speech,&rdquo; Def. Mov. Br. in Supp. Mot. to Dismiss at 22, is unfounded. <br>This is not to say that the <i>Castro</i> court's distinction between media and non-media defendants in its trade purposes analysis may reflect the century-old &ldquo;newsworthiness&rdquo; exception to misappropriation claims, which was an early attempt by courts to take into account First Amendment concerns as they related to freedom of the press. <i>See generally</i> Amicus Brief of 73 Law Professors in Support of Defendant/Appellee Jireh Publishing, Inc., For Affirmance, <i>ETW Corp. v. Jireh Publishing, Inc.,</i> No. 00&ndash;3584 at 6&ndash;8, 2000 WL 35456243 (6th Cir.2000) <i>available at</i> http:// jurist. law. pitt. edu/ amicus/ etw_ v_ jireh. pdf (arguing that &ldquo;The Definition of Commercial Use in Publicity Law Reflects Understandings of the First Amendment from the Early Twentieth Century&rdquo;). While more recent cases make clear that non-newsworthy works are likewise entitled to First Amendment protection, as discussed herein, the <i>Castro</i> court did not explicitly address First Amendment concerns. Moreover, as EA recognizes, the defendant in that case was a media defendant, thus, the <i>Castro</i> court did not address the applicability of its holding to non-media defendants. </p> </div><div note-container="8" id="N197003"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="40" id="pa40">This approach of focusing first on whether a prima facie case misappropriation claim is properly pled before ruling on a First Amendment defense to that claim is the approach taken by a recent California district court decision that EA cites to in a supplemental memorandum to this Court. <i>See</i> EA Supp. Memo dated Sept. 6, 2011. That case, <i>Arenas v. Shed Media US, Inc.,</i> No. CV 11&ndash;05279, Slip Op. (C.D.Cal. Aug. 22, 2011), involved a NBA player's motion for a preliminary injunction against the producers of <i>Basketball Wives,</i> a reality television show starring current and former significant others of professional basketball players. The <i>Arenas</i> court first held that the NBA player sufficiently pled a prima facie misappropriation case, under California law, for the use of his identity. Slip Op. at 6. Only after concluding that the prima facie case was properly pled did the court consider the producer's First Amendment defense. <i>Id.</i> at 8. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="41" id="pa41">Indeed, at the time the Court issued its September 22, 2010 Opinion, the New Jersey Supreme Court had not addressed the misappropriation tort and the First Amendment in one case.

In reaching that conclusion, the Court reasoned: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="44" id="pa44">That the ... defendants are in the business of public relations and marketing and prepared the campaign flyers does not make publication of the flyers a publication in the commercial sense. The campaign flyers represented political speech attacking the judgment of a candidate running for public office. This is the type of speech that is at the heart of First Amendment guarantees. That books, newspapers, and magazines are published and sold for profit does not prevent them from being a form of expression whose liberty is safeguarded by the First Amendment. [Plaintiff] cannot show that the use of his name and image constitutes the tort of misappropriation <span page-number="768" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p768"></span> of one's name and image for a wrongful purpose. <i>Id.</i> at 311&ndash;12 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). While the <i>G.D.</i> Court did not explicitly define the relationship between the misappropriation tort and the First Amendment, nonetheless, by including First Amendment rationale in its analysis of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the Court construed the tort in a manner to avoid conflict with First Amendment principles. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="45" id="pa45">Because of EA's decision not to challenge the sufficiency of Hart's right of publicity allegations for the purpose of this motion, the Court will focus solely upon EA's assertion of the First Amendment defense&mdash;rather than upon how a New Jersey court might construe the prima facie elements of the right of publicity. For this reason, the Court finds EA's inclusion of its disagreement with the Court's interpretation of New Jersey right of publicity law in several footnotes throughout its brief not only irrelevant to the motion but also a distraction from the issue at hand&mdash;the scope of EA's First Amendment defense. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="46" id="pa46">Turning now to the First Amendment defense, the parties dispute whether the First Amendment trumps Plaintiff's claim.

In Plaintiff's view, <i>Brown</i> is distinguishable because it involved a content-based statute deserving of strict First Amendment scrutiny whereas a New Jersey right of publicity claim, in contrast, is not content-based. EA agrees, in its supplemental<span page-number="769" pagination-id="808 F.

Supp. Br. at 4. EA, further, focuses on <i>Brown's</i> confirmation that video games are entitled to full First Amendment protection, and construes <i>Brown</i> as suggesting that video games are not commercial speech entitled to less than full First Amendment protection. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="52" id="pa52"> A content-based speech restriction is one that regulates &ldquo;speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.&rdquo; <i>Galena v.

While EA cites to a law review article to support its contention that a New Jersey right of publicity claim operates as a content-based restriction, <i>see</i> Thomas F. Cotter, et al., <i>Integrating the Right of Publicity with First Amendment and Copyright Preemption Analysis,</i> 33 Colum. J. of Law &amp; the Arts 165 (Winter 2011), that article acknowledges that most courts have not adopted the argument it advocates that the &ldquo;exercise of state publicity rights is a content-based regulation of speech.&rdquo; <a note-disclosure="11" href="#N197104"></a> <i>Id.</i> at 169; <i>id.</i> at 167&ndash;68 (describing court opinions applying the First Amendment to right of publicity claims as &ldquo;all over the map&rdquo; resulting in &ldquo;confusion reflected in the differing approaches.&rdquo;). In addition, the article's thesis turns on whether the speech is commercial or non-commercial; in the authors' view, commercial speech implicating the right of publicity must be judged under intermediate scrutiny and noncommercial speech under strict scrutiny.  </p><div note-container="11" id="N197104"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="53" id="pa53">The authors' &ldquo;argument that the right of publicity is a form of content-based regulation rests on two premises. The first is that the right of publicity regulates words, sounds and visual images that clearly qualify as &lsquo;speech.&rsquo; The second is that, because the right of publicity cannot be &lsquo;justified without reference to the content of the speech,&rsquo; it is content-based, not content-neutral. <i>Id.</i> at 190&ndash;91 (internal footnotes omitted). </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="54" id="pa54">Contrary to the article's proposal, courts apply one of several tests, referred to in the legal discourse as &ldquo;balancing tests,&rdquo; that are unique to intellectual property-related cases, to determine whether the First Amendment limits a right of publicity claim in that context. Courts do not tend to apply strict or intermediate scrutiny tests when addressing a First Amendment defense to intellectual property-related claims, such as the right of publicity. Accordingly, this Court's analysis will focus on the tests actually applied by courts, which tests are explained in more detail <i>infra.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="55" id="pa55"> As to EA's latter argument regarding commercial speech, <i>Brown</i> does not explicitly discuss commercial speech. However, another recent decision of the Supreme Court, <i>Sorrell v.

In that case, the Supreme Court made clear that challenges to content-based restrictions on both commercial and noncommercial speech are generally subject to heightened scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> at 2664 (&ldquo;The First Amendment requires heightened scrutiny whenever the government creates &lsquo;a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.&rsquo; ...

Moreover, Sorrell did not explicitly overrule <span page-number="770" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p770"></span> <i>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of New York,</i> <a href="/case/central-hudson-gas-electric-corporation-v-public-service-commission-of-new-york" class="raw-ref">447 U.S. 557</a>, <a href="/case/central-hudson-gas-electric-corporation-v-public-service-commission-of-new-york" class="raw-ref">100 S.Ct. 2343</a>, <a href="/case/central-hudson-gas-electric-corporation-v-public-service-commission-of-new-york" class="raw-ref">65 L.Ed.2d 341</a> (1980), which recognized a &ldquo;commonsense distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech,&rdquo; <i>Central Hudson,</i> <a href="/case/central-hudson-gas-electric-corporation-v-public-service-commission-of-new-york#p562" class="raw-ref">447 U.S. at 562</a>, <a href="/case/central-hudson-gas-electric-corporation-v-public-service-commission-of-new-york" class="raw-ref">100 S.Ct. 2343</a>, and applied intermediate scrutiny to restrictions on commercial speech. And, <i>Sorrell</i> acknowledges that &ldquo;the government's legitimate interest in protecting consumers from &lsquo;commercial harms' explains &lsquo;why commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech.&rsquo; &rdquo; (citation omitted). <a href="/case/sorrell-v-ims-health-inc-4#p2672" class="raw-ref">131 S.Ct. at 2672</a>. Thus, even after <i>Sorrell,</i> commercial speech may still be entitled to less First Amendment protection than that afforded non-commercial speech, in certain contexts. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="57" id="pa57"> In any event, whatever First Amendment protection is afforded to commercial speech, <i>NCAA Football</i> is not commercial speech. The Third Circuit's decision in <i>Facenda, supra,</i> explains that courts are to consider three factors in determining whether speech is commercial or noncommercial: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="58" id="pa58">(1) is the speech an advertisement; (2) does the speech refer to a specific product or service; and (3) does the speaker have an economic motivation for the speech. An affirmative answer to all three questions provides &lsquo;strong support&rsquo; for the conclusion that the speech is commercial. <i>Id.</i> at 1017 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). In conducting this inquiry, courts are to make &ldquo;a commonsense distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction ... and other varieties of speech.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="59" id="pa59">Applying <i>Facenda</i> here, Plaintiff cannot reasonably contend that the <i>NCAA Football</i> games constitute commercial speech. The speech at issue in <i>Facenda</i> was a video that the court characterized as a &ldquo;late-night, half-hour-long &lsquo;infomercial&rsquo; [for the <i>Madden Football</i> video game, that was] only broadcast eight times in a three-day span immediately before the release of the video game to retail stores&mdash;much like an advertisement for an upcoming film.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 1017. The &ldquo;infomercial&rdquo; referred specifically, and solely, to the <i>Madden Football</i> video game. And, the defendant-producer of the game had a financial interest in the sales of the game. <i>Id.</i> at 1017&ndash;18. In short, the video &ldquo;aim[ed] to promote another creative work, the video game.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 1018. Here, by contrast, the speech <i>is</i> the video game that is being sold. It is not a separate instance of speech that promotes the purchase of another work. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="60" id="pa60">Similarly, in <i>Tellado v.

The <i>Tellado</i> court distinguished between use of the plaintiff's photograph in an advertisement for a book and the hypothetical use of the photograph in the book itself, noting that in the latter case, &ldquo;defendant's use clearly would have been protected by the First Amendment, regardless of what type of profit defendant expected to make with its book series.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="61" id="pa61"> Further, as courts have long recognized, the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech extends not only to political and ideological speech, but also to &ldquo;[e]ntertainment ... motion pictures, programs broadcast by radio and television, and live entertainment, such as musical and dramatic works.&rdquo; <i>Tacynec v.

EA's NCAA Football game wherein [Plaintiff] was throwing a pass with actual footage from Rutgers University's Bowl Game against Arizona State University.&rdquo; Second Am. Compl. at 45. Yet, Plaintiff has produced no evidence that his likeness was ever used in an advertisement for a NCAA Football video game, nor has he suggested that discovery would reveal such evidence. In addition, Defendant denies ever using Plaintiff's image in any advertisement for the games, but has submitted a photograph of Plaintiff &ldquo;throwing a pass [that] appears in a photo montage inside NCAA Football [2009] that can only be seen when a user selects Rutgers as his or her favorite team.&rdquo; <i>See</i> Def.'s R. 56.1 Statement at 24; Supp. Decl. of Strauser, Ex.

Because this photograph is part of the video game itself, the commercial transaction has already taken place, and because Plaintiff's photo does not advertise another product or service, the Court finds no basis for concluding that <i>NCAA Football 2009</i>&mdash;or any other <i>NCAA Football</i> video game&mdash;is commercial speech.<a note-disclosure="12" href="#N197249"></a>  </p><div note-container="12" id="N197249"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="63" id="pa63">To be sure, this commercial speech inquiry differs from my analysis of New Jersey's interpretation of the &ldquo;commercial purpose&rdquo; element in <i>Castro, supra,</i> and other decisions, in the September 22nd Opinion.

Therefore, the Court considers the party's arguments regarding what test the Court should employ to balance Defendant's First Amendment rights against Plaintiff's right of publicity&mdash;the transformative test or the <i>Rogers</i> test.<a note-disclosure="13" href="#N197262"></a> Finally, the Court performs both balancing tests in light of the parties' arguments, and concludes that, in this case, the First Amendment serves as a <span page-number="772" pagination-id="808 F.

As one scholar has noted, &ldquo;[m]ost would acknowledge that the right of publicity needs to be reigned in when it burdens free expression, but no one convenient legal format has been found to set those limits ... The fact is that no judicial consensus has been reached on the contours of the First Amendment vis-a-vis the right of publicity.&rdquo; <i>Publicity, supra</i> at 1363.

Accordingly, I look to decisional law throughout the country that has attempted such reconciliation, as well as secondary sources, for guidance. As noted, many decisions and sources refer to the attempt to reconcile the competing interest of publicity rights and First Amendment rights as a type of &ldquo;balancing test.&rdquo; </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="84" id="pa84">Courts throughout the United States have utilized up to eight &ldquo;balancing&rdquo; tests that attempt to weigh the First Amendment rights of an author/creator against the right of publicity. Michael D. Scott, 1 SCOTT ON MULTIMEDIA LAW &sect; 11.49&ndash; &sect; 11.52 (3d ed.2006). It is important to note, before describing the various tests, that the Supreme Court in <i>Zacchini,</i> the only Supreme Court case addressing a First Amendment defense to the right of publicity, did <i>not</i> engage in a balancing of the competing interests. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="85" id="pa85"> <i>Zacchini</i> involved a television station's broadcast, in its news programming, of a stunt performer's entire cannonball act without the performer's permission. Ruling in favor of the performer's publicity right, and against the broadcaster's reliance on the First Amendment in defense of its airing of the performance, the <i>Zacchini</i> Court reasoned that the First Amendment &ldquo;does not immunize the media when they broadcast a performer's entire act without his consent.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 575, <a href="/case/zacchini-v-broadcasting-company" class="raw-ref">97 S.Ct. 2849</a>. And, the Court added, &ldquo;the rationale for [protecting the right of publicity] is the straightforward one of preventing unjust enrichment by the theft of good will.

Here, Hart advocates for the former and EA for the latter. The United States Supreme Court, the Third Circuit, and the New Jersey Supreme Court have not explicitly endorsed either test. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="88" id="pa88">Hart further urges the Court to adopt a third test he describes as &ldquo;the predominance test.&rdquo; This test, Hart argues, was utilized by a district court in this district in <i>Estate of Presley v.

More importantly, the court in Presley was not fashioning a &ldquo;test,&rdquo; but applied First Amendment principles to the Elvis impersonation act at issue in that case, and courts have since limited Presley to its unique facts. See e.g., <i>Romantics v. Activision Publ'g, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/romantics-v-activision-publishing#p766" class="raw-ref">574 F.Supp.2d 758, 766</a> n. 3 (E.D.Mich.2008) (distinguishing Presley as involving &ldquo;merely a copy or imitation&rdquo; of a performance); <i>Bosley v.

That test is referred to as the &ldquo;predominant use test.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="90" id="pa90">Notably, Presley suggested that the copyright fair use doctrine serves as an appropriate analogy for balancing First Amendment interests with right of publicity concerns. In this way, Presley predicted a transformative-style test. <i>Presley,</i> <a href="/case/estate-of-presley-v-russen#p1359" class="raw-ref">513 F.Supp. at 1359</a> (&ldquo;[While] entertainment ... enjoys First Amendment protection ..., entertainment that is merely a copy or imitation, even if skillfully and accurately carried out, does not really have its own creative component and does not have a significant value as pure entertainment.&rdquo;). As the Presley court reasoned: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="91" id="pa91">Unlike a copier, a parodist or satirist adds his own new and creative touches to the original work, which, in this case, would be the likeness of Elvis Presley as he is performing. The original work basically becomes part of a new and different work which derives its popularity from the added creative elements. The original work, or the likeness of Elvis Presley, is being used in a different manner and for a different purpose. <i>Id.</i> at 1360 n. 21. Accordingly, this Court does not view Presley as espousing an independent test that requires separate analysis, and I will focus my analysis on the transformative test that Presley appears to have foreseen, as well as the <i>Rogers</i> test.<a note-disclosure="21" href="#N197573"></a>  </p><div note-container="21" id="N197573"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="92" id="pa92">To be sure, the first California decision to adopt the transformative test, <i>Comedy III, supra,</i> referenced <i>Presley. </i> <i>Comedy III,</i> <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2#p402" class="raw-ref">25 Cal.4th at 402</a>, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126</a>, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">21 P.3d 797</a>. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="93" id="pa93">In my view, and as explained in more detail herein, the transformative test is more refined than the <i>Rogers</i> test and better balances the competing interests of the right of publicity and the First Amendment. The transformative test's incorporation of copyright's fair use doctrine not <span page-number="777" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p777"></span> only reflects the common underlying principles shared by the right of publicity and copyright doctrine, but properly takes into account the extent of a defendant's use of a plaintiff's image. In this way, the transformative test captures the intricacies involved in deciphering whether a challenged work is a &ldquo;new&rdquo; work entitled to First Amendment protection or merely a blanket attempt to profit from another's property without due compensation. That said, I need not explicitly adopt either test because, for the reasons explained herein, EA's First Amendment defense prevails under both tests. <b>B. <i>Transformative Test</i> </b> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="94" id="pa94"> The tension between copyright interests and the First Amendment is apparent. The First Amendment provides that &ldquo;Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech....&rdquo; Yet the Copyright Act, enacted by Congress under the authority of the U.S. Constitution's Copyright Clause, grants individuals monopoly-like power to preclude others from expressing copyrighted material. It is this &ldquo;paradox,&rdquo; Smolla, <i>supra</i> at &sect; 21:2, that creates tension between the two legal doctrines. The copyright laws grant a copyright owner the right to suppress another person's freedom of speech, when that person seeks to express copyrighted material. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="95" id="pa95"> In 2003, the Supreme Court commented on this apparent tension in <i>Eldred v. Ashcroft,</i> <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft" class="raw-ref">537 U.S. 186</a>, <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft" class="raw-ref">123 S.Ct. 769</a>, <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft" class="raw-ref">154 L.Ed.2d 683</a> (2003). In that case, the Supreme Court observed that both the First Amendment and the Copyright Clause were adopted close in time, suggesting that &ldquo;in the Framer's view, copyright's limited monopolies are compatible with free speech principles. Indeed, copyright's purpose is to promote the creation and publication of free expression.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 788. Importantly, the Court concluded thereafter, &ldquo;copyright law contains built-in First Amendment accommodations.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> This is because the Copyright Act protects only expression, not ideas, and thereby &ldquo;strikes a definitional balance between the First Amendment and copyright law by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author's expression.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 788&ndash;89 (citation omitted). &ldquo;Due to this [idea/expression dichotomy],&rdquo; the Court continued, &ldquo;every idea, theory, and fact in a copyrighted work becomes instantly available for public exploitation at the moment of publication.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="96" id="pa96">Additionally, the Court noted, the fair use defense codified in the Copyright Act &ldquo;allows the public to use not only facts and ideas contained in a copyrighted work, but also expression itself in certain circumstances.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 789. Per that defense, &ldquo;[t]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies ..., for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> Notably, the Court held that there is no need to apply a strict scrutiny test to First Amendment defenses to a copyright infringement claim in light of the aforementioned, built-in First Amendment protections. <i>Id.</i> at 788 (&ldquo;We reject petitioners' plea for imposition of uncommonly strict scrutiny on a copyright scheme that incorporates its own speech-protective purposes and safeguards.&rdquo;). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="97" id="pa97">I briefly turn to a description of the idea/expression dichotomy and the fair use doctrine for context. The idea/expression dichotomy serves as one means of alleviating the tension between copyright protection and First Amendment goals. While scholars debate the precise contours of what constitutes an &ldquo;idea,&rdquo; <i>see generally</i> Smolla, <i>supra</i> at &sect; 21:5, copyright law protects the &ldquo;expression of the idea.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> <span page-number="778" pagination-id="808 F.

Leval in a 1990 Harvard Law Review article on the copyright doctrine of fair use. In that article, Judge Leval argued that the fair use doctrine is best effectuated if individuals are permitted to appropriate another's expression as &ldquo;raw material&rdquo; that the individual then &ldquo;transform[s] in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings....&rdquo; Pierre N. Leval, Commentary, <i>Toward a Fair Use Standard,</i> 103 Harv. L.Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990). Just four years following Judge Leval's suggestion, the Supreme Court employed the transformative use analysis in <i>Campbell v.

In that case, the California Supreme Court held that an artist's sale of lithographed t-shirts of the likenesses of The Three Stooges, which likenesses were reproduced from a charcoal drawing, were undeserving of First Amendment protection because the likenesses were insufficiently transformed. That court recognized that &ldquo;creative appropriation of celebrity images can be an important avenue of individual expression ...

The Court explained: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="106" id="pa106">[w]hen artistic expression takes the form of a literal depiction or imitation of a celebrity for commercial gain, directly trespassing on the right of publicity <i>without adding significant expression beyond that trespass,</i> the state law interest in protecting the fruits of artistic labor outweighs the expressive interests of the imitative artist. <i>Id.</i> at 405, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126</a>, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">21 P.3d 797</a> (emphasis added). A transformative work, in contrast: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="107" id="pa107">is not only especially worthy of First Amendment protection, but is also less likely to interfere with the economic interest protected by the right of publicity [because] distortions of the celebrity figures are not, from the celebrity fan's viewpoint, good substitutes for conventional depictions of the celebrity and therefore do not generally threaten markets for celebrity memorabilia that the right of publicity is designed to protect. Accordingly, First Amendment protection of such works outweighs whatever interest the state may have in enforcing the right of publicity. <i>Id.</i> Ultimately, the California Supreme court concluded, &ldquo;the right-of-publicity holder continues to enforce the right to monopolize the production of conventional, more or less fungible, images of the celebrity.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="108" id="pa108"> In addition, the <i>Comedy III</i> Court provided another (oft-quoted) formulation of the transformative test: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="109" id="pa109">Another way of stating the inquiry is whether the celebrity likeness is one of the &lsquo;raw materials' from which an original work is synthesized, or whether the depiction or imitation of the celebrity is the very sum and substance of the work in question. <i>Id.</i> at 406, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126</a>, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">21 P.3d 797</a>. In using the word &ldquo;expression,&rdquo; the court meant &ldquo;something other than the likeness of the celebrity.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> And, the inquiry is a qualitative rather than quantitative one, &ldquo;asking whether the literal and imitative or the creative predominate in the work.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> <a note-disclosure="23" href="#N197748"></a> Because the t-shirt lithograph depictions of The Three Stooges were nothing more than portraits that lacked any creative contribution by the artist, the court concluded that the t-shirts were not transformative expressions. <i>Id.</i>  </p><div note-container="23" id="N197748"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="110" id="pa110">The court further noted that, in close cases, &ldquo;courts may find useful a subsidiary inquiry ...: does the marketability and economic value of the challenged work derive primarily from the name of the celebrity depicted?&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 407, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126</a>, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">21 P.3d 797</a>. However, even if this question is answered in the affirmative, &ldquo;it does not necessarily follow that the work is without First Amendment protection&mdash;it may still be a transformative work.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> <br>24. <i>Hilton's</i> procedural posture differs from that present in this case. In <i>Hilton,</i> the Ninth Circuit ruled on a motion to strike under California's anti-SLAPP statute. The anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) statute is a law &ldquo;designed to bar meritless lawsuits filed merely to chill someone from exercising his First Amendment rights on a matter of public interest.&rdquo; 580 F.3d at 880 n. 1. The standard of review on a motion to strike brought under California&lsquo;a anti-SLAPP statute differs in some way from the summary judgment standard applicable to this case. <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> at 882 (&ldquo;Such test is similar to the one courts make on summary judgment, though not identical.&rdquo;). Therefore, in light of the distinct standard of review at work in <i>Hilton,</i> I rely primarily on <i>Hilton's</i> statement of the law as opposed to its application. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="111" id="pa111">Since <i>Comedy III,</i> many courts have adopted and applied the transformative test. <i>See e.g., </i> <i>Hilton v.

Jul. 12, 2011). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="112" id="pa112">The transformative test, however, has been subject to some criticism. As explained by one scholar, the test lacks clear, objective guidelines and, thus, &ldquo;can encourage judges to be art critics or base decisions on external factors like the fame of the artist.&rdquo; David Tan, <i>Political Recoding of the Contemporary Celebrity and the First Amendment,</i> 2 Harv. J. Sports &amp; Ent. L. 1, 25&ndash;26 (2011). Tan further explains: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="113" id="pa113">In addition, the cryptic judicial comments that literal depictions like Andy Warhol's silkscreens of celebrities may also be transformative if they carry a particular social message lend little guidance to how a court may meaningfully determine what constitutes the criteria for transformative use. As shown by recent California decisions, the test is focused on visual transformation which can be overprotective of art and entertainment that contribute little to the discussion of public issues, but underprotective of political speech which may be contextually transformative (because of its recoding) though not visually transformative.... In summary, the usefulness of this test appears confined to visual depictions of the plaintiff, and the extent to which the defendant's use has departed from a realistic rendition of the plaintiff's likeness. <i>Id.</i> at 26. Moreover, Tan notes, the copyright fair use doctrine, from which the transformative test was crafted, &ldquo;has been criticized as one of copyright's &lsquo;most nebulous and unpredictable aspects' and should only be &lsquo;invoked as a last resort [in publicity claims] after all other solutions have been tried and found wanting.&rsquo; &rdquo; <i>Id.</i> (quoting McCarthy, <i>supra</i> at &sect; 8:38). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="114" id="pa114">While some may question the vagueness of the fair use doctrine, it nonetheless remains the statutory law for copyright matters and the U.S. Supreme Court found it appropriate in <i>Zacchini</i> to analogize the right of publicity to federal copyright law. <i>See </i> <i>Zacchini,</i> <a href="/case/zacchini-v-broadcasting-company#p573" class="raw-ref">433 U.S. at 573</a>, <a href="/case/zacchini-v-broadcasting-company" class="raw-ref">97 S.Ct. 2849</a>. Moreover, the Supreme Court has described the fair use copyright doctrine as embodying First Amendment principles, thereby dispensing with the need for a strict scrutiny test. <i>See </i> <i>Eldred v. Ashcroft,</i> <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft#p788" class="raw-ref">123 S.Ct. at 788&ndash;89</a>. Still, Tan's point that the transformative test may encourage judges to be art critics has some merit. It is clear from reviewing some of the decisions applying the transformative test, including those discussed below, that courts must engage in a degree of artistic interpretation in order to determine whether a work contains additional expressive elements. Even considering that the test may have some indeterminate qualities, I find that the test's rooting in the fair use doctrine and its consideration of the extent to which an image is copied fairly takes into account the competing right of publicity and First Amendment interests. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="115" id="pa115">There are several decisions applying the transformative test that deserve mention here. In 2003, the California Supreme Court held in <i>Winter v. DC Comics,</i> <a href="/case/winter-v-dc-comics" class="raw-ref">30 Cal.4th 881</a>, <a href="/case/winter-v-dc-comics" class="raw-ref">134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634</a>, <a href="/case/winter-v-dc-comics" class="raw-ref">69 P.3d 473</a> (2003), that a comic book's use of two musicians as inspiration for comic book characters was a transformative use. The comic book series features &ldquo;Jonah Hex,&rdquo; an &ldquo;anti-hero&rdquo; in the context of a five volume miniseries that involved, <i>inter alia,</i> singing cowboys and an emporium patterned after the life of Oscar Wilde. <span page-number="781" pagination-id="808 F.

Also included in the series were two worm-like creatures in a volume entitled &ldquo;Autumns of Our Discontent.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> These worm-like creatures, which are half-worm and half-human, are ultimately killed by Jonah Hex in the final volume of the series. The creatures were named Johnny and Edgar Autumn, and had long white hair and albino features. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="116" id="pa116">Plaintiffs Johnny and Edgar Winter, two musician brothers with long white hair and albino features, sued the creator of the comic books, asserting that the worm-like creatures were appropriations of their likenesses. Rejecting their claim, the California Supreme Court reasoned that it &ldquo;reviewed the comic books ... [and] can readily ascertain that they are not just conventional depictions of plaintiffs but contain significant expressive content other than plaintiffs' mere likenesses.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 890, <a href="/case/winter-v-dc-comics" class="raw-ref">134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634</a>, <a href="/case/winter-v-dc-comics" class="raw-ref">69 P.3d 473</a>. While acknowledging the similar hair and features, the Court concluded that the plaintiffs were &ldquo;merely part of the raw materials from which the comic books were synthesized,&rdquo; and in the Court's view, the drawings were &ldquo;but cartoon characters&mdash;half-human and half-worm&mdash;in a larger story, which is itself quite expressive.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> The Court further reasoned that the plaintiffs' fans would not find the comic books a substitute for the musicians' work. <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="117" id="pa117">Several years later, and drawing upon <i>Winter,</i> the Ninth Circuit in <i>Hilton, supra,</i> applied the transformative test to a Hallmark&reg; greeting card that contained Paris Hilton's image and quoted her famous statement &ldquo;that's hot.&rdquo; As described by that court, the card </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="118" id="pa118">contains a picture above a caption that reads, &ldquo;Paris's First Day as a Waitress.&rdquo; The picture depicts a cartoon waitress, complete with apron, serving a plate of food to a restaurant patron. An oversized photograph of Hilton's head is superimposed on the cartoon waitress's body. Hilton says to a customer, &ldquo;Don't touch that, it's hot.&rdquo; The customer asks, &ldquo;what's hot?&rdquo; Hilton replies, &ldquo;That's hot.&rdquo; The inside of the card reads, &ldquo;Have a smokin' hot birthday.&rdquo; <i>Hilton,</i> <a href="/case/hilton-v-hallmark-cards-3#p891" class="raw-ref">580 F.3d at 891</a>. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="119" id="pa119">The question before the Ninth Circuit was whether Hallmark was entitled to strike and, thereby dismiss, the plaintiff's right of publicity claim based upon its First Amendment defense; the court applied the transformative test to conclude that Hallmark was not so entitled. After comparing Paris Hilton to the character on the Hallmark card, the court reasoned that &ldquo;[d]espite [some] differences ... the basic setting is the same: we see Paris Hilton born to privilege, working as a waitress.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 891.

To the extent <i>Hilton</i> suggests that applicability of the transformative defense is a jury question, I disagree with that reading of <i>Comedy III.</i> Read in context, the quote simply clarifies that courts and juries are capable of determining whether or not a particular work of art is sufficiently transformative to be worthy of First Amendment protection, even where the distinction between protected and unprotected expression is a subtle one. <i>See </i> <i>Comedy III,</i> <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2#p409" class="raw-ref">25 Cal.4th at 409</a>, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126</a>, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">21 P.3d 797</a>. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="121" id="pa121"> Two cases applying the transformative test to video games are particularly instructive. In <i>Kirby v. Sega of America, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/kirby-v-sega-of-america" class="raw-ref">144 Cal.App.4th 47</a>, <a href="/case/kirby-v-sega-of-america" class="raw-ref">50 Cal.Rptr.3d 607</a> (Cal.App.2006), a California court ruled that a video game character fashioned after the plaintiff, a celebrity singer was a transformative use protected by the First Amendment. The plaintiff-singer was a 90's artist who was known for the phrase &ldquo;ooh la la.&rdquo; The video game character was named &ldquo;Ulala,&rdquo; and shared some similarities with the singer. <i>Id.</i> at 59, <a href="/case/kirby-v-sega-of-america" class="raw-ref">50 Cal.Rptr.3d 607</a>. Like Kirby, the character wore platform shoes, had similar facial features and hair color, and wore attire like that worn by Kirby. <i>Id.</i> at 55, <a href="/case/kirby-v-sega-of-america" class="raw-ref">50 Cal.Rptr.3d 607</a>. The character also used phrases known to be used by Kirby, such as &ldquo;groove,&rdquo; &ldquo;meow,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dee-lish.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="122" id="pa122">However, the <i>Ulala</i> character differed from Kirby in physique, and was based, in part, on the Japanese-style animation form of anime. While the character's hairstyle and primary costume mimics one of Kirby's hair colors and outfits, Kirby often varied her hair color and clothing, the court reasoned. Importantly, the court noted, the setting for the game was unique&mdash;in the game, the character was a space-age reporter in the 25th Century. <i>Id.</i> at 59, <a href="/case/kirby-v-sega-of-america" class="raw-ref">50 Cal.Rptr.3d 607</a>. And, the character's dance movements were unlike Kirby's. Altogether, the court concluded, the video game character was transformative. <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="123" id="pa123">Recently, another California court applied the transformative test to the <i>Band Hero</i> video game that included computer-generated avatars designed to look like the members of the rock band <i>No Doubt.</i> In that case, <i>No Doubt v. Activision, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/no-doubt-v-activision-publishing-inc" class="raw-ref">192 Cal.App.4th 1018</a>, <a href="/case/no-doubt-v-activision-publishing-inc" class="raw-ref">122 Cal.Rptr.3d 397</a> (Cal.App.2011), the avatars were literal recreations of the band members, who had posed for photography to enable the video game developer to reproduce the band members' likenesses with great detail. The <i>No Doubt</i> band members sued the developer for exceeding the bounds of the parties' license agreement, and relied on their right of publicity as one basis for their suit. The developer of the video game asserted the First Amendment as a defense. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="124" id="pa124">Ruling in favor of the band members, the court reasoned that the video game was not transformative. The court reasoned: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="125" id="pa125">[The developer] intentionally used ... literal reproductions so that players could choose to &ldquo;be&rdquo; the No Doubt rock stars.

Hart's <i>NCAA Football</i> virtual player, on the other hand, plays college football&mdash;just like Hart did.<a note-disclosure="27" href="#N197963"></a> In contrast to the transformative <i>Ulala</i> character, the avatars in <i>No Doubt</i> were exact replicas of the <i>No Doubt</i> band members who could not be altered in any way by the video game user. Hart's image in <i>NCAA Football</i> differs from the images in <i>No Doubt</i> because his image can be altered in many ways&mdash;from his personal characteristics (height, weight, athletic ability), to his accessories (helmet visor, wristband). In addition, the image's physical abilities (speed and agility, throwing arm, passing accuracy), attributes, and certain biographical details (right handed/left handed) can also be edited by the user.  </p><div note-container="27" id="N197963"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="128" id="pa128">For this reason, I do not find EA's citation to the <i>Arenas</i> case helpful. As noted, <i>Arenas</i> involved an NBA player's challenge to the potential use of his name and likeness on the <i>Basketball Wives</i> reality television program. On a motion for preliminary injunction, the <i>Arenas</i> court concluded that the television program's potential use of the player's name was transformative because <br>it appears that any references in [ <i>Basketball Wives</i> ] will be incidental to the show's plot as a whole. At its core, the show is about the women who have or have had relationships with basketball players rather than the players themselves. Thus, the show appears to be transformative. <br>Slip Op. at 9. <i>NCAA Football,</i> in contrast, is about college football players like Hart. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="129" id="pa129">On the other hand, that Hart's image is placed in a college football game is problematic for EA's assertion of a transformative defense. Placing present and former college athletes, including Hart, into the fittingly-titled <i>NCAA Football</i> game setting strongly suggests that the goal of the game is to capitalize upon the fame of those players. Indeed, &ldquo;[i]t seems ludicrous to question whether video game consumers enjoy and, as a result, purchase more EA-produced video games as a result of the heightened realism associated with actual players.&rdquo; Holmes, <i>supra</i> at 20. This, alone, however, does not mean that EA's use of Hart's image was not transformative. <i>See </i> <i>Winter, supra</i> at 889, <a href="/case/winter-v-dc-comics" class="raw-ref">134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634</a>, <a href="/case/winter-v-dc-comics" class="raw-ref">69 P.3d 473</a> (&ldquo;[i]f it is determined that a work is worthy of First Amendment protection because added creative elements significantly transform the celebrity depiction, then independent inquiry into whether or not that work is cutting into the market for the celebrity's images ... appears to be irrelevant.&rdquo;) (citation omitted). Nevertheless, a game developer that bases its work on real players, in the context of the games that bring them notoriety, may walk a fine line between using reality as a building block for the developer's own creative work and exploiting the hard-earned reputations of college players for its own profit. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="130" id="pa130">For this reason, the Court appreciates the plight of college players who are prohibited by NCAA bylaws from entering into licensing agreements and other &ldquo;commercial opportunities&rdquo; during their playing years. Hart Decl., &para; 5. In this connection, Hart argues that EA has a practice of paying professional football players for the use of their images in EA's professional football video games, suggesting that it is disingenuous for EA to refuse to pay college<span page-number="784" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p784"></span> athletes for the use of their images. In support of this proposition, he attaches the Declaration of Katrina Yu, a law student who avers that she attended a seminar in which Ondraus Jenkins and Michael Shaffer, EA employees, stated that EA licensed professional player images from the players and the NFL. Yu Decl., &para;&para; 1&ndash;7. However, the Court may not consider this hearsay evidence for the truth of the matter asserted on summary judgment. <i>See </i> <i>Smith v. City of Allentown,</i> <a href="/case/smith-v-city-of-allentown#p693" class="raw-ref">589 F.3d 684, 693</a> (3d Cir.2009).

Nevertheless, it bears not on the question before this Court here&mdash;whether or not EA's use of Hart's image is protected by the First Amendment. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="133" id="pa133">Viewed as a whole, there are sufficient elements of EA's own expression found in the game that justify the conclusion that its use of Hart's image is transformative and, therefore, entitled to First Amendment protection. For one, the game includes several creative elements apart from Hart's image. Similar to the <i>Madden NFL</i> video game, as described in a case dismissing a former professional football player's Lanham Act claim, <i>Brown v. Electronic Arts, supra,</i> the <i>NCAA Football</i> game contains &ldquo;virtual stadiums, athletes, coaches, fans, sound effects, music, and commentary, all of which are created or compiled by the games' designers.&rdquo; Slip Op. at 7. Furthermore, as explained by Jeremy Strauser, an Executive Producer at EA responsible for the development of <i>NCAA Football,</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="134" id="pa134">[t]he virtual world of <i>NCAA Football</i> is constructed from a vast array of graphics, sound and other material. Once a user chooses two college teams to compete against another, the video game assigns a stadium for the match-up and populates it with players, coaches, referees, mascots, cheerleaders and fans&mdash;all designed and rendered by EA's artists. Each game has over 100 virtual teams and thousands of virtual players. Strauser Decl., &para; 4. The Court's own review of the video games confirms Mr. Strauser's description. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="135" id="pa135">Even focusing on Hart's virtual image alone, it is clear that the game is transformative. It is true that the virtual player bears resemblance to Hart and was designed with Hart's physical attributes, sports statistics, and biographical information in mind. However, as noted, the game permits users to alter Hart's virtual player, control the player's throw distance and accuracy, change the team of which the player is a part by downloading varying team names and rosters, or engage in &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo; mode, in which the user incorporates players from historical teams into the gameplay. <i>See </i> <i>id.</i> at &para;&para; 6&ndash;8. That the user is able to change the image's features, statistics, and teammates distinguishes <span page-number="785" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p785"></span> <i>NCAA Football</i> from the game at issue in <i>No Doubt,</i> where the characters were immutable.<a note-disclosure="28" href="#N198057"></a> These aspects also distinguish the video game from the greeting card in <i>Hilton,</i> where Paris Hilton's photograph was used in a single, static setting.  </p><div note-container="28" id="N198057"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="136" id="pa136">Moreover, one court persuasively reasons that the use of player names, statistics, and biographical data is entitled to First Amendment protection because that data is in the public domain. <i>C.B.C.,</i> <a href="/case/cbc-v-major-league#p823" class="raw-ref">505 F.3d at 823</a>. The same reasoning applies to the public facts connected to Hart's image. While those public facts are relevant to Hart's prima facie case that his right of publicity was impinged, a legal conclusion assumed for the sake of argument here, &ldquo;it would be strange law that a person would not have a first amendment right to use information that is available to everyone.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> The <i>C.B.C.</i> court's rationale is consistent with the copyright idea/expression dichotomy that the Supreme Court views as properly balancing First Amendment freedoms with intellectual-property like interests. <i>See </i> <i>Eldred,</i> <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft#p789" class="raw-ref">123 S.Ct. at 789</a> (noting that, by virtue of the idea/expression dichotomy, &ldquo;every idea, theory, and fact in a copyrighted work becomes instantly available for public exploitation at the moment of publication&rdquo;). </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="137" id="pa137">To be clear, it is not the user's alteration of Hart's image that is critical. What matters for my analysis of EA's First Amendment right is that EA created the mechanism by which the virtual player may be altered, as well as the multiple permutations available for each virtual player image. Since the game permits the user to alter the virtual player's physical characteristics, including the player's height, weight, hairstyle, face shape, body size, muscle size, and complexion, <i>see e.g.,</i> Strauser Decl., Exh. F at 4 (Part I) (displaying &ldquo;Edit Player&ndash;Appearance&rdquo; screenshot), it follows that EA's artists created a host of physical characteristic options from which the user may choose. For example, EA artists created the several different hairstyles that can be morphed onto the image. <i>See id.</i> The Court's review of the game revealed eight such hairstyle options: fade 1, fade 2, close crop, buzzout 1, buzzout 2, afro, balding 1, and balding 2.<a note-disclosure="29" href="#N198073"></a> In my view, the creation of these varied potential formulations of each virtual player alone makes the game a transformative use of Hart's image.  </p><div note-container="29" id="N198073"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="138" id="pa138">Similarly, there are 24 &ldquo;face&rdquo; options from which a user may choose to alter the appearance of the virtual player's face, as well as 16 &ldquo;face shape&rdquo; options. EA artists, further, created the options for all types of equipment, the virtual player's sports ratings, and the player's &ldquo;player info.&rdquo; The only data that may not be altered is the virtual player's home state, hometown, team, and year (e.g., senior, freshman). </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="139" id="pa139">One could argue that the use of Hart's unaltered image as the starting point for the virtual player suggests that EA's use of Hart's image is not transformative. The problem with this argument is that it fails to fully take into account the distinctive interactive nature of video games. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Brown v. Entert. Merch., supra,</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="140" id="pa140">[l]ike the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas&mdash;and even social messages&mdash;through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium ( <i>such as the player's interaction with the virtual world</i> ). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection. <a href="/case/brown-v-entmt-merchants-assn#p2733" class="raw-ref">131 S.Ct. at 2733</a> (emphasis added). This language from <i>Brown</i> recognizes that a user's interaction with a video game is one of the means by which video games communicate ideas and social messages. To deny <i>NCAA Football</i> First Amendment protection because the game initially displays the virtual player in an unaltered form would not give due accord to this expressive aspect of video games.<span page-number="786" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p786"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="141" id="pa141"> That <i>NCAA Football 2009</i> includes a photograph of Hart throwing a pass, in a photo montage that can be seen when a user selects Rutgers as his or her favorite team, does not alter my conclusion. Having viewed the montage, it is clear that the photograph is but a fleeting component part of the montage and the video game as a whole. Because the photograph comprises such a small portion of the entire work, it cannot be said that the work itself fails to incorporate transformative elements. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="142" id="pa142"> This leaves only the screenshot images from the game that Hart attached to his Second Amended Complaint and his opposition to the instant motion. As noted, those images are taken from <i>NCAA Football,</i> though Hart has not explained in his papers from which game or game(s) the screenshots were taken. In his Complaint exhibit, Hart juxtaposed, next to the screenshots, photographs of himself taken during his college career. In comparing the screenshots to the photographs, it is clear that the screenshots reflect his image. Hart further argues that the screenshots show the virtual player &ldquo;in the same position&rdquo; as in the photographs. McKenna Cert., &para; 7. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="143" id="pa143">While the screenshots reflect Hart's image, in my view, the screenshots do not depict the virtual player in the exact position as Hart appears in the photographs. There are variations. Even if the screenshots did replicate the photographs, that would not end the inquiry&mdash;the question here is whether EA's use of Hart's image in the game is transformative. That a few still screenshots in the context of a larger video game reflect his image does not undercut the existence of the additional creative elements of the game, discussed above, and the variable permutations of his image, created by EA's artists, for use in the game. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="144" id="pa144">In this connection, Hart points to a statement from EA's website indicating that the goal of <i>NCAA Football</i> (no pun intended) is to create &ldquo;the most realistic authentic [football] performance [so that the user may] feel what it's like to cover the field and play at the most elite level in college football.&rdquo; McKenna Cert., Exh. I. He, further, attaches statements from online articles that also describe the video game as a realistic experience. <i>See id.</i> at Exh. H, J, K. Whether EA has attempted to create a realistic experience, however, is not the focus of my inquiry. The pertinent question is whether EA's use of Hart's image is transformative and, for the reasons expressed above, I conclude that the use is transformative.<a note-disclosure="30" href="#N198119"></a>  </p><div note-container="30" id="N198119"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="145" id="pa145">Lastly, Hart states in his declaration that, &ldquo;[i]n addition to my image being used in the video game, my image was used in the promotion for Defendant EA's NCAA game wherein I was throwing a pass with actual video footage from Rutgers' bowl game against Arizona State.&rdquo; Hart Decl., &para; 20. However, Hart does not point to any evidence in support of this assertion, he does not explain where or when his image was purportedly used, nor does he attach a copy of this use. Accordingly, the Court does not consider this ostensible promotional use of his image. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="146" id="pa146">My analysis is in contrast to that in <i>Keller, supra,</i> cited by Plaintiff. In that case, the District Court for the Northern District of California held that <i>NCAA Football</i> is not sufficiently transformative. Looking solely at the image of the former college player-plaintiff in that case, who had previously played for Arizona State University, the court reasoned: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="147" id="pa147">the quarterback for Arizona State University shares many of Plaintiff's characteristics. For example, the virtual players wears the same jersey number, is the same height and weight and hails from the same state. EA's depiction of <span page-number="787" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p787"></span> Plaintiff is far from the transmogrification of the Winter brothers. EA does not depict Plaintiff in a different form; he is represented as he [sic] what he was: the starting quarterback for Arizona State University. Further, unlike in <i>Kirby,</i> the game's setting is identical to where the public found Plaintiff during his collegiate career, on the football field. 2010 WL 530108 at *5.<a note-disclosure="31" href="#N198143"></a> EA argued to the <i>Keller</i> court that the court should consider the video game as a whole, and not focus solely on the former player's image. The court rejected this argument, reasoning that <i>Winter</i> and <i>Kirby</i> did just that. <i>Id.</i>  </p><div note-container="31" id="N198143"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="148" id="pa148">This aspect of <i>Keller's</i> ruling is currently on appeal to the Ninth Circuit. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="149" id="pa149">As an initial matter, EA's motion before the <i>Keller</i> court was a motion to dismiss. As such, the court considered only &ldquo;those documents whose contents [were] alleged in [the] complaint,&rdquo; 2010 WL 530108 at *5 n. 2, and it did not take into account declarations, submitted by EA, that described the games. Nor did the court consider other materials submitted by the parties, although it did take &ldquo;judicial notice&rdquo; of the content of the games. <i>Id.</i> That this Court considers EA's motion as one for summary judgment, taking into account declarations and other materials, as well as the games themselves, distinguishes my ruling from <i>Keller.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="150" id="pa150">With regard to <i>Keller's</i> substantive analysis, that court fails to address that the virtual image may be altered and that the EA artists created the various formulations of each player. As noted, I find this aspect of the game significant because it suggests that the goal of the game is not for the user to &ldquo;be&rdquo; the player, as in <i>No Doubt,</i> where the virtual player could not be altered. The malleability of the player's image in <i>NCAA Football</i> suggests, instead, that the image serves as an art-imitating-life starting point for the game playing experience. In this way, while the player image may not be fanciful, like the worm-like characters in <i>Winter,</i> it is one of the &ldquo;raw materials' from which an original work is synthesized, [and] the depiction or imitation of the celebrity is [not] the very sum and substance of the work in question.&rdquo; <i>Comedy III, supra</i> at 406, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126</a>, <a href="/case/comedy-iii-productions-v-gary-saderup-inc-2" class="raw-ref">21 P.3d 797</a>. Moreover, one could argue that even the technology that permits users to alter a player's image is itself a noteworthy, expressive attribute of the game. None of these facts were considered by the <i>Keller</i> court. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="151" id="pa151">Finally, I disagree with <i>Keller's</i> approach of focusing solely on the challenged image, as opposed to the work as a whole. Contrary to <i>Keller's</i> reasoning, I read <i>Kirby</i> as looking at the video game in that case, as a whole. By focusing on the setting in which the <i>Ulala</i> character appeared, <i>Kirby</i> considered the entire game. Similarly, the <i>Winter</i> court considered that the purported images of the Winter brother musicians were &ldquo;cartoon characters&mdash;half-human and half-worm&mdash; <i>in a larger story, which is itself quite expressive.</i>&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 890, <a href="/case/winter-v-dc-comics" class="raw-ref">134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634</a>, <a href="/case/winter-v-dc-comics" class="raw-ref">69 P.3d 473</a> (emphasis added). While the <i>Winter</i> Court did focus most of its attention on the fanciful worm-like characters, it also considered the larger story of which the characters were a part. Moreover, in my view, it is logically inconsistent to consider the setting in which the character sits, which <i>Keller</i> does in its analysis, yet ignore the remainder of the game. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="152" id="pa152">For the aforesaid reasons, I conclude that, under the transformative test, EA is entitled to assert the First Amendment as a defense to Hart's appropriation claim. <b>C. <i>Rogers Test</i> </b> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="153" id="pa153">The <i>Rogers</i> test was developed by the Second Circuit in <span page-number="788" pagination-id="808 F.

That test was first applied in a 1957 decision by a New York appellate court in <i>Dallesandro v. Henry Holt &amp; Co.,</i> <a href="/case/dallesandro-v-holt-co" class="raw-ref">4 A.D.2d 470</a>, <a href="/case/dallesandro-v-holt-co" class="raw-ref">166 N.Y.S.2d 805</a> (1957). In that decision, the court applied the &ldquo;real relationship&rdquo; test to a right of publicity claim, brought under the New York statute, by a priest who alleged that a book based on his life, and that featured him on the book cover, violated his right of publicity. The court <span page-number="789" pagination-id="808 F.

The family-plaintiffs argued that the article was not related to their photograph because none of the children were conceived by in vitro fertilization.

Important here is that, while <i>Rogers</i> was addressing a First Amendment defense to a Lanham Act claim, it apparently imported the New York &ldquo;real relationship&rdquo; test without explaining why that test was helpful in the Lanham Act context. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="164" id="pa164">In addition to its Lanham Act analysis, <i>Rogers</i> engages in a separate legal analysis of Ms. Rogers common-law right of publicity claim.

After clarifying a choice-of-law question as to which state law applied to her claim, the court determined that an Oregon court would determine that Ms. Roger's right of publicity claim failed. Referencing the Oregon state constitution's free speech clause, which Oregon courts have interpreted more broadly than the federal constitution, <i>Rogers</i> then turned to Oregon decisional law, holding that a celebrity's name may be used in a movie title unless the title was &ldquo;wholly unrelated&rdquo; to the movie or the title was &ldquo;simply a disguised commercial advertisement....&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 1004. This &ldquo;wholly unrelated&rdquo; and &ldquo;disguised commercial advertisement&rdquo; language is strikingly similar to the Lanham Act relatedness test, but comes from a distinct body of law. Ultimately, it is not clear from my reading of <i>Rogers'</i> language whether it disposed of the right of publicity claim on state law, as opposed to federal constitutional grounds, but other courts have read <i>Rogers</i> as resting on federal constitutional grounds. <i>See e.g., </i> <i>Parks v.

The Sixth Circuit held that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the song title was &ldquo;wholly unrelated&rdquo; to the song and whether the use of her name was a &ldquo;disguised commercial advertisement.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 461. These courts may have chosen to apply the right of publicity test because right of publicity claims do not embody the same likelihood-of-confusion concerns that the <i>Rogers</i> Lanham Act test is designed to protect. <i>See </i> <i>Parks,</i> <a href="/case/parks-v-laface-records#p460" class="raw-ref">329 F.3d at 460</a> (&ldquo;[A] right of publicity claim does differ from a false advertising claim in one crucial respect; a right of publicity claim does not require any evidence that a consumer is likely to be confused.&rdquo;) (citing <i>Herman Miller, Inc. v. Palazzetti Imports,</i> <a href="/case/herman-miller-v-palazzetti-imports-exports#p319" class="raw-ref">270 F.3d 298, 319&ndash;20</a> (6th Cir.2001); <i>Rogers,</i> <a href="/case/rogers-v-grimaldi#p1004" class="raw-ref">875 F.2d at 1004</a>; <i>Cairns v.

While this holding is technically dicta, because the <i>Romantics</i> court first determined that the plaintiffs in that case failed to adequately assert a publicity claim under state law, it further illustrates that several courts have applied the right of publicity test as opposed to the Lanham Act test. In any event, the Lanham Act and right of publicity tests are very similar and EA argues that it is entitled to a First Amendment defense under either test. <i>See</i> Def. Mov. Br. at 32 (discussing both tests simultaneously). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="170" id="pa170">EA's argument as to why I should apply <i>Rogers</i> here is convoluted, yet easily addressed. According to EA, because New Jersey follows the Restatement, and the Restatement (Third) mirrors New York's statutory appropriation tort which a New Jersey court has described as &ldquo;essentially the same&rdquo; as New Jersey's common law tort, <i>Tellado,</i> <a href="/case/tellado-v-time-life-books-inc#p912" class="raw-ref">643 F.Supp. at 912</a>, and because the <i>Rogers</i> test appears to track the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, I should adopt that test.<a note-disclosure="37" href="#N198459"></a> Underlying EA's argument is the assumption that I should follow New Jersey law. However, as explained <i>supra,</i> I am bound by federal law interpretation of the constitutional defenses&mdash;not state law interpretations thereof.  </p><div note-container="37" id="N198459"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="171" id="pa171">It is true that the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition promotes a new trend of treating right of publicity claims as competition-based claims, as opposed to property-right-based claims. However, even if this Court were bound by New Jersey's approach to a federal constitutional issue, New Jersey has yet to formally adopt this particular Restatement. That said, there is an historic rationale for applying a test that treats right of publicity actions as akin to unfair competition claims. In the early U.S. Supreme Court opinion of <i>International News Service v. Associated Press,</i> <a href="/case/international-news-service-v-associated-press" class="raw-ref">248 U.S. 215</a>, <a href="/case/international-news-service-v-associated-press" class="raw-ref">39 S.Ct. 68</a>, <a href="/case/international-news-service-v-associated-press" class="raw-ref">63 L.Ed. 211</a> (1918) <i>superceded by </i> <i>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins,</i> <a href="/case/erie-co-v-tompkins" class="raw-ref">304 U.S. 64</a>, <a href="/case/erie-co-v-tompkins" class="raw-ref">58 S.Ct. 817</a>, <a href="/case/erie-co-v-tompkins" class="raw-ref">82 L.Ed. 1188</a> (1938), the Court analyzed one news service's almost verbatim copying of another news service's newspaper articles as violating unfair competition laws as opposed to copyright or other property-based laws. <i>Id.</i> at 235&ndash;36, <a href="/case/international-news-service-v-associated-press" class="raw-ref">39 S.Ct. 68</a> (&ldquo;We need spend no time, however, upon the general question of property in news matter at common law, or the application of the copyright act, since it seems to us the case must turn upon the question of unfair competition in business.... [T]his does not depend upon any general right of property analogous to the common-law right of the proprietor of an unpublished work to prevent its publication without his consent; nor is it foreclosed by showing that the benefits of the copyright act have been waived.... [T]the news of current events may be regarded as common property. What we are concerned with is the business of making it known to the world, in which both parties to the present suit are engaged.&rdquo;). </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="172" id="pa172">Moreover, as explained above, courts have noted that right of publicity claims do not embody the same likelihood-of-confusion concerns that the <i>Rogers</i> Lanham Act test is designed to protect. <i>See </i> <i>Parks,</i> <a href="/case/parks-v-laface-records#p460" class="raw-ref">329 F.3d at 460</a> (&ldquo;[A] right of publicity claim does differ from a false advertising claim in one crucial respect; a right of publicity claim does not require any evidence that a consumer is likely to be confused.&rdquo;) (citing <i>Herman Miller, Inc. v. Palazzetti Imports,</i> <a href="/case/herman-miller-v-palazzetti-imports-exports#p319" class="raw-ref">270 F.3d 298, 319&ndash;20</a> (6th Cir.2001); <i>Rogers,</i> <a href="/case/rogers-v-grimaldi#p1004" class="raw-ref">875 F.2d at 1004</a>; <i>Cairns v.

And, the <i>Rogers</i> right of publicity test mirrors the Lanham Act test. For this reason, I question the wisdom of applying a trademark-based test to right of publicity claims without accounting for this difference. The <i>Rogers</i> court did not explain the genesis of its Lanham Act test, yet it appears that the test was borrowed from New York's &ldquo;real relationship&rdquo; test. If that is the case, <i>Rogers</i> fails to explain <span page-number="792" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p792"></span> why it imported that newsworthiness-based test into the Lanham Act context.<a note-disclosure="38" href="#N198501"></a>  </p><div note-container="38" id="N198501"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="173" id="pa173">Others may argue that the <i>Rogers</i> Lanham Act test derives solely from trademark law. A dissenting justice in <i>ETW</i> explains that the Second Circuit decision issued shortly after <i>Rogers, </i> <i>Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/cliffs-notes-v-bantam-doubleday-dell-pub-gr" class="raw-ref">886 F.2d 490</a> (2d Cir.1989), clarified that application of the &ldquo;the <i>Rogers</i> balancing approach&rdquo; must &ldquo;take[ ] into account the ultimate test in trademark law, namely, the likelihood of confusion as to source of the goods in question&rdquo; by also applying the &ldquo;the eight-factor likelihood of confusion test....&rdquo; <i>ETW,</i> <a href="/case/etw-corp-v-jireh-pub-inc#p948" class="raw-ref">332 F.3d at 948</a> (quoting <i>Cliffs Notes,</i> <a href="/case/cliffs-notes-v-bantam-doubleday-dell-pub-gr#p495" class="raw-ref">886 F.2d at 495</a>). </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="174" id="pa174">Arguably, one benefit of applying either of the <i>Rogers</i> tests (the Lanham Act or right of publicity tests) is that they are both straightforward, and do not require courts to engage in as much artistic interpretation as required by the transformative test. However, like the &ldquo;real relationship&rdquo; test, the <i>Rogers</i> tests may be manipulated depending upon the level of generality employed by the parties or the reviewing court. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="175" id="pa175">It is important to note that the Third Circuit has not adopted the <i>Rogers</i> test in the context of either a Lanham Act claim or a right of publicity claim. In <i>Facenda,</i> the Third Circuit declined to rule on the test's applicability to a Lanham Act claim. <i>See</i> <a href="/case/facenda-v-nfl-films-inc#p1018" class="raw-ref">542 F.3d at 1018</a>. In addition to the Sixth Circuit, two other circuits, however, have adopted the test for use in the Lanham Act context. <i>See </i> <i>Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/mattel-inc-v-mca-records-inc#p902" class="raw-ref">296 F.3d 894, 902</a> (9th Cir.2002); <i>Sugar Busters LLC v.

Rock Star Videos, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/ess-entertainment-2000-v-rock-star-videos" class="raw-ref">547 F.3d 1095</a> (9th Cir.2008), the Ninth Circuit applied the <i>Rogers</i> test to a Lanham Act claim relating to the content of a video game that incorporated the use of a night club's name into the game scenery. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="176" id="pa176">Notably, in <i>Brown v. Electronic Arts,</i> No. 2:09&ndash;cv&ndash;1598 (C.D.Cal. Sept. 23, 2010) (Slip Op.), the Central District of California applied the <i>Rogers</i> test to conclude that the use of a former professional football player's likeness in EA's <i>Madden NFL</i> video game was protected by the First Amendment. In that Lanham Act action, the court concluded that &ldquo;the mere use of [the plaintiff's] likeness in the game, without more, is insufficient to make the use explicitly misleading.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 8. A similar holding was reached in another Lanham Act video game case brought against EA, albeit not a sports-related game. <a note-disclosure="39" href="#N198553"></a> That court had already dismissed the plaintiff's right of publicity claim on other grounds, but noted that &ldquo;it would have analyzed that claim under <i>Rogers</i> also....,&rdquo; <i>Dillinger, LLC v.

Jun. 16, 2011), at the parties' request.  </p><div note-container="39" id="N198553"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="177" id="pa177">A recent Lanham Act case applies <i>Rogers</i> to EA's <i>The Godfather</i> video games. That case, <i>Dillinger, LLC v. Electronic Arts, Inc.,</i> No. 1:09&ndash;cv&ndash;1236, 2011 WL 2457678 (S.D.Ind. Jun. 16, 2011), involved the video game's use of the image of John Dillinger, a gun-slinging bandit from the 1930's era who was a flashy womanizer. Dillinger was also known for his use of the Tommy Gun submachine gun. <i>Id.</i> at *2. In <i>The Godfather</i> video game, which is fashioned after Francis Ford Coppola's <i>The Godfather</i> films, users may choose a Tommy Gun weapon out of seventeen weapon options. The weapon is identified, in the game, as the &ldquo;Dillinger Tommy Gun.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at *3. Ruling in favor of EA, the court reasoned that EA's use of the &ldquo;Dillinger Tommy Gun&rdquo; name in its video game is (1) related to the <i>Godfather</i> world where flashy gangsters spray their enemies with such guns, and (2) does not explicitly mislead purchasers into believing that Dillinger sponsored or endorsed the game. <i>Id.</i> at *6. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="178" id="pa178">In short, although the Third Circuit has not adopted the <i>Rogers</i> test to either Lanham Act or right of publicity claims, there <span page-number="793" pagination-id="808 F. Supp. 2d 757" id="p793"></span> is some precedent for applying the <i>Rogers</i> test to misappropriation actions like that presented in this case. Accordingly, although I am not convinced by EA's arguments as to the applicability of the <i>Rogers</i> test, and, in my view, the transformative test better balances First Amendment and right of publicity interests, I will assume for the sake of argument that the test applies. Applying the test here, I conclude that, under either the <i>Rogers</i> Lanham Act test or the strikingly similar right of publicity test, <i>NCAA Football</i> is entitled to First Amendment protection. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="179" id="pa179"> As noted, the <i>Rogers</i> Lanham Act test is a two-prong test that asks: (1) whether the challenged work has relevance to the underlying work; and (2) if the challenged work is relevant, whether the title misleads the public as to the source of content of the work. <i>Rogers,</i> <a href="/case/rogers-v-grimaldi#p999" class="raw-ref">875 F.2d at 999</a>. The use of Hart's image in the video game has great relevance to the game itself, which is set on a college football field and revolves around the playing of virtual football. In addition, the use of Hart's image in the game cannot reasonably be said to mislead the public as to the content or source of the video game. Hart has not suggested, in his opposition brief, that the use of his image leads the public to believe that he has endorsed the <i>NCAA Football</i> product. Indeed, in his opposition brief, Hart fails to adequately address the <i>Rogers</i> test altogether. He merely cites the case in one footnote, and provides no analysis of the <i>Rogers</i> test factors. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="180" id="pa180"> Under the <i>Rogers</i> right-of-publicity test, the two queries are: (a) whether the challenged work is wholly unrelated to the underlying work; or (b) whether the use of the plaintiff's name is a disguised commercial advertisement. <i>Rogers,</i> <a href="/case/rogers-v-grimaldi#p1004" class="raw-ref">875 F.2d at 1004</a>. One cannot reasonably argue that Hart's image is wholly unrelated to the game, for the same reasons expressed under my analysis of the Lanham Act test. Nor is the use of Hart's image a &ldquo;disguised commercial advertisement.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> Instead, the use of his image is part of an expressive act by EA that might draw upon public familiarity with Hart's college football career but does not explicitly state that he endorses or contributes to the creation of the game. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="181" id="pa181">As explained by the court in <i>Seale v. Gramercy Pictures,</i> <a href="/case/seale-v-gramercy-pictures" class="raw-ref">949 F.Supp. 331</a> (E.D.Pa.1996), applying <i>Rogers</i> to a Pennsylvania right of publicity claim, &ldquo;[i]f the name or likeness is used solely to attract attention to a work that is not related to the identified person, the user may be subject to liability for a use of the other's identity in advertising.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 336 (quoting Restatement (Third) Unfair Competition &sect; 47, cmt c.). On the other hand, the &ldquo;use of a person's name and likeness to advertise a novel, play, or motion picture concerning that individual is not actionable as an infringement of the right of publicity.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> (citing Restatement (Third) Unfair Competition &sect; 47, cmt a.) Here, EA's use of Hart's image is clearly related to the video game and is not simply an advertisement for an unrelated product.<a note-disclosure="40" href="#N198629"></a> Therefore, I conclude that EA is entitled to First Amendment protection under the <i>Rogers</i> right of publicity test.<span page-number="794" pagination-id="808 F.

CONCLUSION</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="184" id="pa184">In sum, it is my view that the transformative test best encapsulates the type of nuanced analysis required to properly balance the competing right of publicity and First Amendment interest. Nonetheless, having concluded that EA is entitled to First Amendment protection under either the transformative test or either of the Rogers' tests, the Court need not decide which test should generally apply to misappropriation cases. On the facts of this case, EA is entitled to assert the First Amendment defense and its motion for summary judgment must, therefore, be granted.</p> </section><hr> </section></div></div></section><section class="pb-5 container-fluid d-none"><div class="row"><div class="content-header col-12 col-lg-5 offset-lg-2"><div class="slogan text-muted mt-4">Summaries of</div><div class="short-title"><h1 class="mt-2">Hart v.

        lizards, such as green iguanas, utilize a combination of high heat, fermentation 
        and gut microbes to effect a breakdown and utilization of their food. 
        </font> </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Green iguana 
        <a href="iguana/teeth.html">dentition</a> is consistent with the tooth 
        design of other completely herbivorous species, with their teeth used 
        for cropping large pieces of plant matter for ingestion.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">The structure 
        of their gut is similar to that of herbivorous mammals including a greatly 
        enlarged, elaborate colon. Food passes through the small intestine into 
        the large, pouch-like anterior colon. The colon of herbivorous lizards 
        contains many folds and partial partitions which may act to slow the passage 
        of food through the colon, giving increased time to fermentation and time 
        to work on the ingesta by the microbial inhabitants of the colon (protozoans, 
        bacteria and nematodes) which are instrumental in breaking ingesta down 
        into utilizable materials.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Volatile 
        fatty acids in very high levels are found in the colon of these lizards, 
        consistent with the high levels found in herbivorous mammal rumens. The 
        comparatively low levels found in the small intestine and stomach indicate 
        that very little breakdown of structural carbohydrates occur in these 
        areas. The low levels of VFA on the other side of the anterior colon, 
        in rapidly decreasing amounts as ingesta passes through the large intestine, 
        indicate that VFA are being absorbed through the anterior large intestine.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Herbivorous 
        lizards tend to be larger than their omnivorous and carnivorous counterparts 
        as mass-energy requirements decrease in proportion to increasing body 
        size. With plant diets being less energy-rich than omnivorous or carnivorous 
        diets, larger body size is more efficient, especially when there are significant 
        seasonal variations in the amount and quality of food available.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Large body 
        size may also be a factor of the gut symbiont process as these organisms 
        need high heat to function properly. Thus, while it takes longer for a 
        large ectotherm to heat up to optimum range, they are able to maintain 
        the optimum temperatures longer after the external source of heat is no 
        longer present. It is likely no coincidence that herbivorous lizards may 
        be found across a rather narrow band around the world. All but a very 
        few are tropical. Chuckawallas and desert iguanas are two of the exceptions, 
        but, living as they do in the warmest parts of the North American southwest 
        deserts, they are able to meet and maintain the necessary core body temperatures.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Rate of 
        digestion, as it relates to both the time of passage through the gut and 
        to the efficiency of digestion, is a factor of body temperature, quantity 
        and quality of food. <i>Efficiency</i> relates to the breakdown and extraction 
        of nutrients necessary not only to maintain basic body functions but also 
        to enable growth and reproduction.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Zimmerman 
        and Tracy found, in their look at herbivory and ectothermy:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Higher 
        temperatures + larger quantities of food high in fiber = faster passage 
        but with less efficiency (typical of feeding during lush seasons)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Higher 
        temperatures + smaller quantities of high fiber = slower passage but greater 
        efficiency (typical of feeding during dry seasons)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">High temperatures 
        + large or small quantities of low fiber = rapid inefficient passage</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Low temperatures 
        + smaller quantities of high fiber = slower passage with reduced efficiency 
        (during cooler periods, ectotherms will conserve energy by seeking cooler 
        places, thus reducing the drain on energy reserves)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Low temperatures 
        + small quantities of low fiber = slower inefficient passage</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">&quot;Food 
        is an important resource in the environment for organisms, and factors 
        related to transforming food into nutrients are likewise important. Given 
        the potentially accentuated influence of body temperature on rates of 
        digestion of plant material in herbivorous ectotherms, we propose that 
        daily, seasonal, and geographic patterns of distribution and abundance 
        of herbivorous ectotherms may coincide with daily, seasonal and geographic 
        patterns of availability of temperatures in the environment needed to 
        digest vegetation at rates adequate for maintenance, growth and reproduction.&quot; 
        (Zimmerman and Tracy, p. 405)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">More recent 
        research by Baer <i>et al.</i>, looks at dietary fiber, intake quantity, 
        metabolization, and growth in green iguanas. They found that while the 
        daily dry matter intake was about the same, the digestibility and metabolization 
        of energy decreased as the level of fiber increased. Greater growth was 
        seen in the iguanas fed the diets containing low and medium fiber (19% 
        and 24% neutral detergent fiber, respectively) versus high fiber (27% 
        NDF).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">On the 
        face of it, the two studies appear to be contradictory. However, it points 
        to the fact that fiber helps slow the overall rate of passage of food 
        through the gut, giving the gut flora more time to work on breaking down 
        the ingesta. The end result that when more ingesta is broken down, more 
        is available for uptake. There comes a point, however, when <i>enough</i> 
        becomes <i>too much</i>. This is why the benefits of the lower fiber diet 
        outweigh (literally, in this case) the medium fiber diet, and both are 
        better, in terms of net metabolizable energy, than the highest fiber diet. 
        Finally, during the lush times of year, not only is more food available, 
        but the food is of high quality and more of it is eaten, so there is an 
        overall net gain for herbivores.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">There are 
        circumstances in which faster early growth is more desirable than slow 
        growth. We see in wild iguanas that hatchlings grow quiet rapidly, growing 
        from 2.5-3 in. SVL at hatching, to 8 in. by the end of their first year. 
        Oftedal, Werner, and others who were working on captive breeding of green 
        iguanas to promote them both as a food source and to conserve local resources, 
        found that by adding animal protein to the herbivorous iguana diet, hatchlings 
        grew much faster, resulting in a reduced risk of being preyed upon. The 
        more recent Baer, <i>et al.</i> study also uses a manufactured diet, but 
        there is no indication of which diet this was or what it contained, so 
        its usefulness, in terms of comparing it to a leafy greens only vs. greens/vegetables/alfalfa/fruit 
        diet is limited.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">As discussed 
        above, larger ectotherms take longer to warm up, but stay warmer longer, 
        than do small ectotherms. This may impart advantages, such as digestion 
        going on longer every day even after the cooler temperatures of night 
        set in. Larger animals also have larger stores of energy to draw upon 
        in case of stress or illness, and so should be able to withstand such 
        periods longer before showing signs of illness than smaller animals. For 
        species in the pet trade, more rapid growth in youngsters may help them 
        withstand the generally deleterious conditions of the importer and pet 
        stores (and expo vendors). More rapid growth over the short term may also 
        help the animal cope with the stresses caused by new pet keepers who often 
        know nothing or obtained incorrect species care information when they 
        first bring their new pet home. Pet species are often subjected to substandard 
        care for several months or longer before their keepers finally find out 
        what their pet's requirements really are and make the necessary adjustments 
        to their pet's diet and captive environment.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Captive 
        Diets vs. Wild Diets<br>
        </b> Reptile keepers rarely, if ever, have access to the dozens of different 
        types of plants on which herbivorous lizard species feed throughout the 
        course of their lives in the wild. There, as the seasons change (from 
        wet to dry in the tropics, rather than hot to cold), so, too, does the 
        plant availability. The nutrient levels in plants may also change throughout 
        the year. During the dry season, when less food is available, the plants 
        are tend to be less nutritious as they dry out or go dormant.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">When we 
        compare the availability and nutrient cycles of plants in the wild to 
        the produce available to us in our markets, we find a very different situation. 
        While our markets may show some seasonable variation in what is available, 
        the increasing globalization of trade in fresh produce results in most 
        produce being found year round, at least in major urban centers. The produce 
        trade, geared towards human diets and preferences rather than those of 
        herbivorous reptiles, rarely includes plants typically found in wild herbivore 
        diets. The variety of produce in any one store is further dependent upon 
        the amount of physical space the store chooses to devote to their produce 
        department.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">There are 
        certain plants stocked in most produce departments that are generally 
        considered to be staples. Examples of these plants include head and romaine 
        lettuces, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. As people continue to move around 
        and consumers try to meet dietary guidelines that place an emphasis on 
        eating a variety of vegetables and greens, the types of food plants found 
        in many markets in most urban areas have expanded accordingly. Nonetheless, 
        the plants in our markets do not reflect the variety or nutrients-per-plant 
        that our herbivorous and omnivorous reptiles would eat in the wild.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Some people 
        insist that by including anything other than dark leafy greens in the 
        diet is dangerous to herbivorous lizards. They claim that the regular 
        feeding of vegetables, <i>even when they are a part of a total diet that 
        includes leafy greens</i>, is a problem as mixed greens/vegetable diets 
        are higher certain nutrients, including plant protein, than a diet that 
        is 100% (or nearly so) leafy greens. Feeding a &quot;rich&quot; greens/vegetable 
        diet will lead, they say, to an early death, just as does feeding animal 
        proteins. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">When reading 
        about different types of fresh food diets, it must be kept in mind that 
        there have been no longitudinal studies comparing the various 100% leafy 
        green diets promoted on some sites and the combination leafy greens/vegetable/alfalfa/fruit 
        (&quot;mixed&quot;) diet. A diet based solely on leafy greens will generally 
        contain more calcium oxalate [binds calcium and causes mineralization 
        of soft tissues] and goitrogens [binds iodine, leading to thyroid gland 
        impairment]), factors mitigated by a healthy mixed diet. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">Until someone 
        sits down with large numbers of herbivorous hatchlings (or neonates) that 
        can be raised for 15+ years (or, ideally, for more than one generation) 
        in a strictly controlled setting to study the long term effects of the 
        different diets, it is all going to be just so much conjecture. </font></p>

<H1>What is Digital Terrain Analysis? </H1>

<H3>...or &quot;how do you spell <I>relief</I>?&quot;</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="images/rainbowline.gif" HEIGHT=2 WIDTH=800></P>

<P><I>Relief</I>, a vertical measurement, may be portrayed on a two-dimensional
map in several ways. <I>Terrain analysis</I> involves the symbolization
and representation of a landscape. Familiar topographic products include:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Hill Shaded Maps </LI>

<LI>Raised Relief Maps </LI>

<LI>Contour Maps, etc. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Maps depicting topography have been produced throughout cartographic
history, but it is only recently that point elevations have been collected
in precise digital form. </P>

</P>

<P>At the heart of terrain analysis is the raw elevation data, which may
have been collected in a variety of ways. In the past all topographic data
was collected by surveyors using instruments such as the level, transit
and theodolite (<A HREF="http://www.lsrp.com/">click here</A> for further
links to land surveying information from the Huntinton Technology Group.).
Today, the same data may be collected by survey teams, but now using GPS
(Global Positioning System) receivers.</P>

<P>There are currently many excellent reference sources on GPS applications
on the Internet. Some great &quot;jumping-off&quot;&nbsp;spots include:</P>

<UL>
<LI><I><A HREF="http://www.gpsworld.com/resource.htm">GPS&nbsp;World</A></I>
magazine's list of resources</LI>

<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/gps/gps.htm">U.S. Coast Guard's
GPS Home Page</A></LI>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cnde.iastate.edu/gps.html">GPS&nbsp;Resources</A>
home page at Iowa State </LI>
</UL>

<P>Terrain information is currently acquired by remote sensors on airborne
or spaceborne platforms, and is usually stored as a Digital Elevation Model
(DEM). A DEM is a file of rows (<I>x</I>) and columns (<I>y</I>) corresponding
to pixel locations. The value assigned to each pixel is the <I>z </I>value,
or elevation. Many DEMs are available free of charge, and are downloadable
from the <A HREF="http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/nsdi/gendem.htm">USGS</A>.</P>

<P>However, an ASCII file of <I>z values</I> is virtually meaningless without
the ability to &quot;visualize&quot; the landscape. Image processing software
makes it possible to &quot;view&quot; the &quot;virtual&quot; landscape
in a variety of ways. </P>

<P><B>For example...</B></P>

DEMs a series of virtual terrains can be generated and animated, as below.</P>

  <dd>
        <p>An Islamist military force that emerged in the Arabian Peninsula at the beginning of the twentieth century. They became allied with Ibn Saud ['Abd al-'Azīz Āl Sa'ūd] and played a decisive role in his rise to power. The gradual disintegration of this alliance lead to the Ikhwan Revolt in 1927, which ended with Ibn Saud's decisive victory at the Battle of Sabilla in 1929. The remnants of the Ikhwan were then absorbed into the new Saudi Arabian National Guard.</p>

  <dd>
        <p>The name of the family that rules the present-day emirates of Ras al Khaima and Sharjah. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the influence of the Qawāsim (singular Qāsimī) extended along the western coast of the Musandam Peninsula as well as to parts of the opposite Persian coast and nearby islands. Though the inhabitants of these areas were mostly not members of the Qāsimī tribe, they are often referred to as such in the India Office Records. In addition, during their quest to eradicate Arab ‘piracy’, the British came to view the Qawāsim as being the chief perpetrators, and frequently used their name (anglicised as ‘Joasmee’) to refer to any seafaring Arabs they suspected of being pirates.</p>

  Lascar  </dt>

        <p>A term used by the British officials to describe non-European sailors employed on East India Company ships. The majority were from South Asia, but Arab, Chinese and East African people, among others, were also employed and referred to as ‘Lascars’.</p>

<p>The term originates from the Farsi ‘lashkar’, meaning ‘army’, and referring to labour gangs contracted to work on ships in the Indian Ocean. This practice predated European intervention in the Indian Ocean and was later co-opted by colonial powers. The term passed back into local use as ‘lascar’, via Portuguese, English, and/or Dutch, and on the west coast of India was used to mean 'sailor' by the 17th century.</p>

  Secret Committee  </dt>

        <p>The East India Company first created a Secret Committee during the 1680s. The normal function of the Secret Committee, or Committee of Secrecy, of the Court of Directors during the period 1709-1784 was to safeguard the Company’s shipping, but it was often made responsible for overall control of the Company’s political, military and naval affairs, especially during the wars between Great Britain and France of 1744-1783. After the establishment of a statutory Secret Committee in 1784, the Committee of Secrecy was confined to protecting Company shipping. The statutory Secret Committee had two primary functions: to sign and despatch to the Company’s governments in India the orders of the Board of Control relating to matters of war, peace and negotiations with Indian states which were deemed to require secrecy; and to receive and deliver to the Board secret letters from India about the same such matters or other questions of administration treated as secret.</p>

  Trucial Coast  </dt>
  <dd>
        <p>A name used by Britain from the nineteenth century to 1971 to refer to the present-day United Arab Emirates. It derives from a series of maritime truces signed, from 1835 onwards, by Britain and the local rulers (the ‘Trucial Chiefs’), culminating in the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 1853. It gradually succeeded ‘Pirate Coast’ as the name most frequently used by the British.</p>

  Turkish Arabia  </dt>
  <dd>
        <p>A term used by the British officials to describe the territory roughly corresponding to, but not coextensive with, modern-day Iraq under the control of the Ottoman Empire. This area contained the Ottoman administrative divisions, or vilayets, of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, which were ruled directly by the Ottoman Empire from 1831 to the end of the First World War. Turkish Arabia should not be confused with Ottoman Arabia, which refers to the areas of the Arabian Peninsula to which Ottoman authority extended.</p>

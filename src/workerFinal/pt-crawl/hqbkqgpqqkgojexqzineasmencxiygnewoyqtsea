      November 7, 2003, UNESCO held a special awards ceremony in Paris,
      identifying 28 &quot;Declared Masterpieces of Oral &amp; Intangible
      Heritage of the World&quot;. Azerbaijani Mugham was one of the
      genres chosen for this program, now in its second year of existence.
      Last year, 19 awards were presented; the third Proclamation is
      scheduled for 2005.<BR>
<BR>
      Mugham is a musical term, which refers to improvised modal music
      with a melody, free of meter. It is also a general term applied
      to Azerbaijani traditional art music.<BR>
<BR>
      Mr. Koichiro Matsuura, Director General of UNESCO, stated that
      the goal of the Masterpieces Program is to raise public awareness
      of the value of this heritage and encourage governments to take
      legal and administrative steps to preserve it.<BR>
<BR>
      Other Masterpiece groups were from Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil,
      Central African Republic, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Cuba, Egypt,
      Estonia, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kyrgzystan, Madagascar,
      Mexico, Mongolia, Korea, Tonga, Turkey, Vanuatu, Vietnam, Iraq
      and Yemen. A detailed description and photographs of the masterpieces
      can be downloaded: co.org/culture/heritage/ intangible/masterpieces/list2003<BR>
<BR>
      These Masterpiece awards are not limited to music. For example,
      this year the know-how of itinerant doctors in South America
      who are familiar with the properties of nearly 1,000 plant species
      was recognized, as was a communication system among different
      language communities in Vanuatu who use finger drawings in sand,
      and the woodcrafting knowledge of the Zafimaniry in Madagascar.<BR>

      2003 Masterpiece jury was comprised of 18 experts who examined
      56 candidatures. Ramiz Abutalibov, Azerbaijan's veteran representative
      to UNESCO, was the driving force in helping to coordinate this
      work with Paris. <BR>
<BR>
      The Candidature was quite complex and consisted of written text,
      video documents (one 10-minute video, and another video 5-6 hours
      long), photos, bibliography and a list of human resources. <BR>
<BR>
      French Ethnomusicolgist Jean During was selected as the international
      expert for preparation of this file, while I was invited as the
      national expert. Mr.<BR>
      During prepared a 50-page text, while I wrote one of 40 pages.
      The text also required identifying various projects, aimed at
      safeguarding and preserving mugham, and promoting it in Azerbaijan
      and throughout the world.<BR>
<BR>
      The bibliography included books such as Uzeyir Hajibeyov's &quot;Principles
      of Azerbaijani Folk Music&quot;, Afrasiyab Badalbayli's &quot;Musigi
      Lughati&quot; (Musical Dictionary), Jean During's, &quot;La Musique
      Traditionelle de l'Azerbayjan et la Science des Mugams&quot;,
      and Feridun Shushinsky's works.<BR>

      Following the Awards Ceremony, on November 14, 2003, the UN Radio
      broadcast an interview with me related to Azerbaijan's mugham
      and played samples performed by Habil Aliyev (kamancha), Haji
      Mammadov (tar), Shovkat Alakbarova (vocal), and Vagif Mustafazade
      (piano, jazz-mugham).<BR>

      Another major international event related to Azerbaijani mugham
      took place on October 17-26 in Taipei at the Asia Pacific Arts
      Forum 2003. Organized in collaboration with the Taipei National
      University of the Arts, the program included a symposium and
      musical festival. More than 100 participants were invited to
      the forum from the U.S., France, Belgium, Japan, Russia, Indonesia,
      India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. <BR>
<BR>
      Azerbaijan was represented by Shur Azerbaijan which includes
      five musicians: Zabit Nabizade (singer or &quot;khananda&quot;),
      Mohlat Muslumov (tar), Fahraddin Dadashev (kamancha), Aydin Aliyev
      (garmon, an instrument somewhat like an accordion), and Elshan
      Gasimov (naghara, like drums). Shur Azerbaijan gave three concerts
      which were very well accepted.</FONT></P>

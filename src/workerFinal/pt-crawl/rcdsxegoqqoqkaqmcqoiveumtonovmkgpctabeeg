<br>
Acceptable Use Policy:<br>
<br>
Introduction<br>
This Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) sets forth the principles that govern 
the use by users of the Web-based products, material, texts, images, 
information and services (the Material) provided by me. This AUP is 
designed to help protect the visitors to my site, and the Internet 
community, from irresponsible, abusive or illegal activities.<br>
<br>
General Violations<br>
This AUP identifies the actions that I consider to be Prohibited Actions
 (meaning those actions which create denial of access or impediment of 
service).<br>
<br>
Prohibited Actions: General Terms and Conditions of Use<br>
- Copying/duplicating the Material or creating subsets or derivative databases from the Database, except for personal use only.<br>
- Assigning, selling or passing along the Material.<br>
- Publishing or otherwise disseminating the Material or creating subsets
 or derivative databases from the Database for commercial use or sale.<br>
- Providing services for a fee using the Material or any subsets or derivatives thereof.<br>
- Allowing data from the Material to be made available to others or 
downloading the Material onto any electronic storage media or 
distributing or transferring the Database or Search Results in any form 
(printed, electronically relayed, posted to public list services or 
bulletin boards, or magnetically stored) to, or for the benefit, of 
others.<br>
- Unauthorized distribution of passwords and/or access codes is strictly prohibited.<br>
<br>
Prohibited Actions: Impersonation/Forgery<br>
- Adding, removing, or modifying identifying network header information (aka "spoofing") in an effort to deceive or mislead.<br>
-&nbsp; Attempting to impersonate any person by using forged headers or other identifying information.<br>
<br>
Prohibited Actions: Network unfriendly activity<br>
- Any activities which adversely affect the ability of other people or 
systems to use my services or the Internet are prohibited. This includes
 "denial of service" attacks against the GWDG servers, network hosts or 
individual user.<br>
<br>
Prohibited Actions: Commercial e-mail<br>
- Sending unsolicited commercial e-mail. Using an GWDG e-mail or Website address to distribute commercial e-mail is prohibited.<br>
- Sending large volumes of unsolicited e-mail (aka "mail bombing") is prohibited.<br>
<br>
Prohibited Actions: Access control and Authentication<br>
- Attempting to circumvent user authentication or security of any host, 
network, or account (aka "cracking") is strictly prohibited. This 
includes, but is not limited to, accessing data not intended for the 
user, logging into a server or account the user is not expressly 
authorized to access, or probing the security of GWDG servers and 
networks.<br>
<br>
Prohibited Actions: Proxy Hunters, Spiders, Robots<br>
-Using any program/script/command, or sending messages of any kind, 
designed to interfere with a users session, by any means, locally or by
 the Internet.<br>
<br>
Enforcement<br>
I reserve the right to monitor or have monitored Internet access to my 
services by users either myself or by personnel at the GWDG. Should 
users be discovered to be engaged in Prohibited Actions as outlined 
above, which create denial of access or impediment of service, and which
 adversely affect my ability to provide services, I reserve the right to
 temporarily suspend or have suspended user access to the GWDG Host 
Server and/or Database. This temporary suspension will remain in effect 
until the Prohibited Actions have ceased.</div>

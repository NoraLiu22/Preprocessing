<h3>
3.4. The Economy of the Armenian Highlands at the
Beginning of the lst Millennium B.C.
</h3>
The economy of the Armenian Highlands and Transcaucasia during this time had advanced appreciably. The archeological cultures
do not show any of the uniformity which was characteristic for
the end of the 3rd millennium B.C. A thousand years of internal
wars led to a somewhat greater cultural isolation of the individual
regions, while at the same time it preserved a typological homogeneity. We will not dwell on the characteristics of the cultural
sub-areas, referring the reader instead to archeological works (163),
We shall only point out some of the more important features common to the entire territory under study.
<p>
As Piotrovsky has shown, semi-nomathc stock-rearing based on
mountain pastures dominated in the field of production, but metallurgy began to acquire an increasing significance. The end of the
2nd millennium B.C. is here the acme of the Bronze Age. Development of the Transcaucasian deposits of copper ore and realgar
probably accounts for the rich growth of the local cultures. An
alloy of copper with arsenic was used instead of bronze proper
(copper and tin). The beginnings of the industrial use of iron (164)
date from the 11th to 9th centuries B.C. The iron was acquired
primarily in the mountains west of the Upper Euphrates valley and
in Pontus (165).  As the late S. M. Bacieva has shown (166),  the iron trade route was controlled by the princes of the Northern Syrian alliance, bringing them enormous wealth. In her opinion the offensive
of Urartu against Northern Syria during the 8th century B.C. should
be explained by the desire to intercept iron, so necessary for the
equipping of the Assyrian army. According to Greek authors, another route of iron export was through the Mosynoeci, who got
the ore from their dependents the Chalybes, i.e., probably the
Georgian-speaking tribe of Chaldians (or Moschi?) in Pontus (167).  The Mosynoeci sold the iron to the Greek colonies.
<p>
Right up to the 8th century B.C. (when a strong Assyrian influence begins to be felt in Urartu) the material culture and the way
of life in the Highlands, including the type of clothing and weapons,
continued to be half Hurrian, half Luwian ("Hittite") in its [79] nature (168).   The Aramaean and Luwian Northern Syria, the Luwian (or
mixed) regions of the Cilician Taurus, and the valleys of the Upper
Euphrates valley, where Hurrians were mixed with the Mushki, Urumeans, and Luwians, remained the leading area culturally.
<p>
By the beginning of the 1st millennium B.C. the mountain regions had achieved a relatively high level of development. Under
the conditions of a prevailing nonmarket economy this made them
comparatively independent of the importation of goods from the
more developed south, except for luxury articles. The mountaineers exported iron, but the proceeds of this trade went to the
Northern Syrian princes (who were in a position to dictate high
prices for the metal on the external market) or to the Greek colonies, and the trade barely influenced the economy of the Highland's population as a whole. At the same time the development
of handicrafts and agriculture in Mesopotamia required a constant
influx of cheap raw materials (not only of iron, but also of copper,
timber, etc.) from the mountain regions. Since natural exchange
was not available, Assyria changed to forced seizure of raw materials and handicraft articles (mainly metallurgical) by conquering the peripheral areas and systematically plundering them for
tribute (169).  Military campaigns also supplied the economy of Mesopotamia with labor force.
<p>
Urartu was the one area of the Highlands which was least accessible to enemies, and it therefore found itself in more favorable
conthtions for development. But in order to survive alongside of
powerful and bellicose Assyria, Urartu had to catch up quickly. It
had to rival its threatening southern neighbor's level of military
and administrative development and its important conquests.
Therefore in relation to its periphery Urartu played a role analogous to that of Assyria in relation to its own, with the difference
that, being economically more backward, the northern kingdom
apparently devoted more attention to the quick development of
its agriculture (particularly of gardening) by introducing extensive
irrigation measures (170). We know very little about the society of
the Highlands at the beginning of the 1st millennium B.C., but we
have some information for the 8th-7th centuries on the social
structure of Urartu (171) and of Mana (172).  It is probable that the same general features were also typical of the other states of the Armenian Highlands. One such feature was the active political role of
the free community members (Urart. <i>shurele</i>, plural of <i>shure</i>, "sword";
"arms" seem to have had the connotation of "tribes" and also
"freemen" generally). These freemen were liable for military and
other services and lived in communities of extended families. Such
communal villages, apparently with dwelling towers, surrounded
the fortress-settlements (E.GAL) or the self-goveming "towns" [80] (Urart. <i>patare</i>) (173).  Among the royal personnel, the <i>mari</i> (cf. Hurrian <i>marianna</i>) and the royal kinsmen (more particularly. the latter) were
prominent.* In Mana it is particularly clear that the state was dominated by a tribal or clan oligarchy. The tribal division of society
was still preserved here (as also in Daiene); along with the king
there existed in Mana a council of elders, comprised of royal kinsmen, councillors, provincial governors, and possibly the elders of
the different townships, as well as tribal chieftains (174).  Such councils of elders also existed presumably in the other "countries" of
the Highlands in the pre-Urartian period.
<p>
Assyrian-type artifacts and Assyrian customs began to penetrate
the Urartian aristocracy only toward the end of the 9th century
B.C. The Urartian royal court with its thousands of eunuchs (175) was
organized according to the Assyrian pattern, however no large royal
field economies arose in the Highlands even during the dominion
of Urartu. Rather, the palaces, both in the capital and in the provincial administrative centers, were usually places where tribute
from the local population was stored and processed by artisans.
Nor did any field estates belong to the sanctuaries. These were
both regular temples and holy sites where the cult was practiced
before a "door" carved in the rock or before a stele or stone slab.
Their wealth consisted of the sacrificial cattle which the kings would
present to the temple and of the obligatory, expiatory, and votive
offerings which the population would bring. The rank-and-file
community members would consume part of the meat offered during the sacrifices, and they also apparently received cattle from
the temple by way of loan or purchase (176).
<p>
In the beginning, slavery was little developed, probably less so
than in the Hittite Empire. The royal inscriptions continually mention massacres of the males captured by the Urartian army. When
the Urartian kings began to bring captives by the thousands from
their campaigns, those whose lives were spared were frequently
settled on land and were even recruited into the army (177).  We have
already referred to the curious fact that the cuneiform heterogram
LU2.A-SI,  which in Hittite designated the <i>hippares</i>, captives settled in groups on the land, is in the Urartian cuneiform used in the
meaning of "warrior of the (tribal) militia."
<p>
Both the Assyrians and the Urartians introduced a centralized
administration by "provincial governors" (<i>bel pehate</i>) in the subject territories. But in the pre-Urartian period there must have been
preserved a more patriarchal type of government, most likely similar to that in Mana, where provincial governors and tribal chieftains were practically independent rulers--probably assisted by their own councils of elders. The organized settlements and [81] villages ("towns") seem to have had, under the domain of Urartian kings, their own kind of self-government (council, popular assembly?). With respect to some "countries" and tribes the Urartian inscriptions do not mention individual rulers, and here a type of "military democracy" probably still prevailed. But even in some of the "countries" which had already reached the level of state, there probably existed comparatively democratic conthtions. This can be seen from the fact that slaves and impoverished community members attempting to free themselves from obligatory services, and even rebellious members of the aristocracy, sought refuge here.
Such areas of refuge were Shubria (178) and Melid-Kammanu (179). With respect to Shubria, which was situated high up in the mountains,
this is not very surprising. But it seems strange for commercial
Melid, which claimed in addition the role of a major political power.
Perhaps this can be explained by the fact that here among the
population there was a considerable percentage of comparatively
recently settled tribes, which may have brought with them the
traditions of tribal democracy--viz., the Proto-Armenians.
<p>
The narrative of Xenophon about the Mosynoeci in the end of
the 5th century B.C., analyzed in detail by M. I. Maksimova, gives
a certain notion of the life of the tribes of the Highlands which still
were on the level of primitive communities. A clan aristocracy had
already formed among them, distinguished by tattooing and a fat
appearance (they were specially fattened on roasted chestnuts).
Multi-storied towers served as the dwellings of the Mosynoeci (just
as they did the Hurrians and the Urartians, except that the Mosynoecian towers were wooden). Each tribe seems to have had
two chieftains: a ritual "king," who never left his tower, and an
"archon," who conducted administrative and military matters, apparently along with a council of clan chieftains (180).
<p>
What has been said about the society of the Armenian Highlands,
beginning with its more developed areas which had a stable governmental structure (Urartu), and ending with the backward tribes
(Mosynoeci), allows us to imagine also those social conthtions which
prevailed here on the eve of the Urartian conquests of the 8th
century B.C.
<hr>
<h3>3.5. Assyrian Aggression into the Armenian Highlands
during the 11th-9th Centuries B.C.</h3>
The historical events of the first half of the 1st millennium B.C.
are known from a number of sources; one may expound them in
considerable detail. But this has already been done in many monographs dedicated to the history of Assyria (181) and Urartu (182),  and we shall not encumber our account by repeating this varied [82] information. We shall concentrate primarily on the fate of the Upper Euphrates valley and the regions directly contiguous with it, since it is unanimously considered that the Armenian nation was formed precisely here, and we have already approached the period of its formation.
<p>
We know that the Assyrian king Assurbelkala made an inroad
into the Highlands in 1076 and 1074 B.C.--first against the federation of Uruatri, and then a second time against Hemmu (Hemmuwa). Somewhat later there was a campaign against the Mushki
and again later against Musru. In his inscription, fortresses and
"countries" are listed whose names partly coincide with those
mentioned by Adadnerari I (183).  No Assyrian campaigns into the
Highlands are known to have taken place from that time to the
reign of Adadnerari II. In 911 he waged war against Iluia, the king
of the Qumanians, and the tribes of Haphi "unto the countries of
Mehri, Salua, and Uratru"; then the king was active in Kadmuhi
and marched four times against the Highlandss of Nairi, including
Alzi.  In 895 and 894 he came to the assistance of the city of Qumme,
which was fighting with the mountain tribes (184).
<p>
Tukulti-Ninurta II also invaded Nairi at least twice (889-884
B.C.) (185).  His most important campaigns were, however, in northern Mesopotamia, which he again tried to subject to Assyria, attempting to seize it from its Aramaic dynasts. The Aramaeans had
founded a number of small kingdoms there, which bore the traditional name of Hanigalbat (i.e., Mitanni). One of the most important enemies of Assyria in the eighties of the 9th century B.C.
was 'Ammi-Ba'al, the king of the Aramaean kingdom which had its
center in the city of Amed (Amida, now Diyarbakir). In connection
with his campaigns against Amed, Tukulti-Ninurta apparently made
a detour through the Highlands. In addition, in his last campaign
he went up along the Middle Euphrates and the river Habur to
Nasibina (Mtsbin of the Armenian sources of the Middle Ages) and
Huzirina (now Sultan-tepe) and, passing over the mountains (apparently over Kashiari--Masius--Tur-'Abdin), attacked the country of the Mushk (186),  where, according to his annals, he destroyed
the crops, seized cattle and sheep, and imposed a large tribute on
the inhabitants. From this we may conclude that at this period the
kingdom of the Eastern Mushki had again spread from Alzi into the
valley of the Tigris. In the conclusion to his annals Tukulti-Ninurta
II boasts that he "captured the region of the high mountains, from
the country of the Subareans [i.e., the Hurrians] to the countries
of Gilzan and Na[iri ...] ...; in all 2720 horses I brought into
harness for the forces of my land."
<p>
The might of Assyria was restored by his son [83] Assurnasirapal II
 (884/3-859 B.C.). Like his father, he made campaigns mainly into
northern Mesopotamia and into the valley of the Upper Tigris
(Kadmuhi, Amed). He brutally wiped out the local population, 
subjecting it to the most cruel tortures and executions; the descendants of the Assyrians who had settled there in earlier years, and who by this time had lost their connection with Assur, were
also mercilessly slaughtered. Entire districts were completely laid
waste. Assurnasirapal's campaigns touched only the outlying regions of the Highlands. In 879 and 866 (187),  with the intent of coming up on hostile Amed from the rear, he twice made detours: the first
time along the left bank of the Upper Tigris (the country of the
Ulluba) and from there through the area between the sources of
the Tigris and the Euphrates (Dirria, Nirbu) (188); the second time
along the Euphrates "to the towns of the countries of Assa (Alzi?)
and Haphi, which are opposite the country of Hatti" (here "Hatti"
stands for "Melid"), and then across the western source of the
Tigris near Lake  Sua (Golcik) and the mountains of Amadani, and
again through the land of the Dirria, as well as Mallanu (near modern Ergana). Although for the time being the Assyrian raids did not bring much harm to the mountain dwellers, who, when their
enemies appeared, hid themselves and their cattle in inaccessible
mountains, the evil fame of growing Assyria forced some "countries" to try and buy Assurnasirapal off with gifts. Among those who acted in this way were the Eastern Mushki, Gilzan, and Hubushkia in 883, during the Assyrian campaign in Kadmuhi, as well
as Shubria, Inner Urumu, and a series of other thstricts in 882, during a campaign which led roughly into the same region. It is important to note that among the gifts of the Mushki, apart from domestic animals, there were bronze utensils and wine; this indicates
that in the interval between the 11th and beginning of the 9th
centuries they had changed to a settled way of life and had taken
up farming and hanthcrafts. The annals of Assurnasirapal also mention that certain Assyrians had fled to Shubria "because of hunger and famine" but were returned to be settled in one of the conquered towns.
<p>
According to the information of the later inscriptions of
Assurnasirapal (189),  he subjugated the countries "from the river Subnat (i.e., the eastern source of the Tigris) to Urartu." However what is meant here is apparently only plundering in the outlying
districts of the mountains and reception of gifts from the countries named above.
<p>
By the time of the next Assyrian king, Shalmaneser III (859-821 B.C.)  (190),  almost all of Mesopotamia had already been firmly subjugated. Shalmaneser made several serious raids into the heart of [84] the Armenian Highlands. In 859 he fell on Hubushkia from the east
and then clashed with the forces of Aramu, king of Urartu, and
reached Lake Van (191).  In 856 he conducted a large campaign up
along the Euphrates, through the countries of Amed, Isua-Alzi (the
land of the Eastern Mushki), and Suhmu, where he occupied the
fortress of Uashtal and captured the ruler of the province, a person
named Sua; he then crossed into the valley of the Choroh and made
a raid into the kingdom of Daiene. On his way back he crossed
the Highlands up to the point where at the time the Urartian territory began. After defeating the army of Aramu (accorthng to the Assyrian assertions, 3,400 Urartian warriors fell in battle), he captured the Urartian fortress and administrative center of Arashkun
(medieval Artske?) and set off for Lake Van by a roundabout way,
from the east, across the province of Aramale (Armarele). Shalmaneser then returned to Assyria through Gilzan, Hubuskia, and the valley of the Upper Zab (192).  The result of this campaign was
the inclusion of the entire Upper Euphrates valley, incluthng Alzi
and Suhmu, into the new Assyrian province of Na:iri (with its center at Amed) (193).  As usual, the unassailable Sasun Mountains allowed Shubria to remain independent; Shalmaneser III's attempt in
854 to besiege Anhitte (or Anhitteshe), the king of Shubria, in his
fortress of Uppumu ended in a compromise--the Shubrian king
paid a one-time propitiatory gift, and the Assyrians wididrew the
siege and left (194).
<p>
In 845, using a bridgehead in the Upper Euphrates valley, the
Assyrians struck a blow at Melid (195) and the country of Suhmu (196),
which evidently had been able to throw off the yoke, and started
a new campaign against Aramu the Urartian. We are told that at
this time the Urartian possessions extended to the source of the
Euphrates (Karasu). At this spot the king of Daiene, Asia, appeared
before the Assyrian king expressing his submission (197).  In 832 Daian-
Assur, a general of the ageing Shalmaneser, made one more campaign along the right bank of the Arsanias against the Urartian king, this time Sarduri I (198).  In addition there were other Assyrian campaigns under Shalmaneser III against Haphi, Hubuskia, Musasir
(touching on the outlying districts of Urartu), as well as Gilzan (199).
<p>
Shalmaneser III tried to subjugate Syria and the provinces to the
west of the Euphrates. In 858 he defeated the coalition of the
Northern Syrian alliance and received tribute from it in 854, but
in the same year he suffered a defeat by the Southern Syrian alliance at Karkar (200), and had to retreat back beyond the Euphrates. After a while he again started a series of almost yearly campaigns
to the west, both into Syria and into southeastern Asia Minor (Melid,
Tabal, Gurgum, Pakarhabuna, Que) (201); however he did not [85] succeed in firmly tying these provinces to Assyria.
<p>
After 827 periodic internal troubles began in Assyria, strongly
limiting its aggressive possibilities. Except for a few casual campaigns (in 805 and 759 B.C., against Arpad in Syria; in 801 and 795 B.C., against Hubuskia) (202),  Assyria did not undertake any major attacks to the west or north until the second half of the 8th
century B.C.
<hr>
<h3>3.6. The Creation of the Urartian Empire. Urartians in the
Valley of the Upper Euphrates</h3>

In the meantime the period of Urartian expansion began. We
have seen that already under Aramu (c. 865-845 B.C.) and Sarduri
I (c. 835-825 B.C.) (203),  the territory of the Urartian kingdom included the upper reaches of the Arsanias and even the sources of the Euphrates. Under Ishpuine (c. 825-810 B.C.) (204),  Urartu captured the territory between lakes Van and Urmia (205),  Musasir became dependent on Urartu (206), and, passing through Mana, the Urartian forces
outflanked Assyria (207) in the region to the south of Mana (208).
<p>
Unfortunately the chronology of most of the Urartian campaigns
of the 8th century B.C. either has not been established at all (for
the rule of Minua), or established very unreliably (for the rule of
Sarduri II). Only the chronology of the campaigns of Argishti I is
more or less reliable.
<p>
The beginning of the decisive offensive against Assyria by the
Urartian king Minua (c. 810-786 or 780 B.C.) apparently should
be dated to the years 800- 790. As far as we can understand from
the fragments of this Urartian king's annals (209),  the attack proceeded in two directions: on the right flank the Urartians marched from the region of present-day Bitlis, crossed the pass of Marma (in the Armenian Taurus) and, passing through Uliba (Ulluba) and
Dirgu (Dirria), descended into Mesopotamia to the west of the
source of the Tigris. Here they invaded Ishala (Assyr. Isalla), between Commagene and the upper reaches of the river Habur). On the left flank they penetrated along the valley of the Upper Zab to the border of Assyria proper, to the south of the city of Qumenu
(Qumme).
<p>
Somewhat later, during Minua's next invasion of Mana, another
detachment of his forces made one more campaign in the valley
of the Upper Euphrates (210).  This campaign apparently ended in
bringing Alzi and the other surrounding "countries" under the
control of Urartu (211).  As Melikishvili presumes, the "provincial governor," Titia, installed here by Minua, was in fact an autonomous
ruler (212),  and the position of Alzi must have therefore improved in
comparison with the period of Assyrian control. The seriously [86] 
damaged inscriptions of Minua from the Mush valley (213) refer to one
of his campaigns into the mountains of the Armenian Taurus (mentioned are the country of Urmie and the city of Qulmeri, which is Assyrian Qullimmeri in Shubria). It is possible that the king of the province in question (i.e., Urmie-Shubria?) was not removed by
the Urartian conqueror (214).  Minua's further successes are related in
his inscription from Palu (215).  From the inscription it is evident that
he conquered the country of Supa (Sophene; here probably part
of Suhmu or Alzi) and reached the "Hittite country" (here the
kingdom of Melid-Kammanu), receiving tribute from the king of
the city of Melitia (Melid).
<p>
Thus the left shore of the Upper Euphrates was placed under
the domain of Urartu. Further to the north Minua reached Diauhe
(Daiene) and imposed tribute on its king Utupurshi (216).  He also expanded the Urartian possessions beyond the mountain of Masis-Ararat to the river Araxes (217).
<p>
However more campaigns were required for the firm subjugation of the Upper Euphrates valley. Thus the next Urartian king, Argishti I, in 783 (according to Melikishvili) or in 777 (according to I. M. Diakonoff) (218) again carried out a campaign against the "Country of the Hittites" with its capital of Melitia (219),  and to where the
dynasty of one Tuate ruled (220),  and further against the country of
Niriba (Nirbu) and down along the Euphrates (221). In all almost 30,000
inhabitants of both sexes were captured here and led away, and
6,000 "warriors of the country of the Hittites and of Supa" were
displaced and settled as a garrison in the new city of Erbune, built
by Argishti I in the following year at the site of present-day Erevan
in the Ararat valley, which he had recently conquered (222).  In 773
(767) Argishti's warriors raided the country of Urmie, from which
it is evident that this country was no longer subject to Urartu as
it may have been previously.
<p>
Argishti marched against Diauhe (Daiene) at least twice. In the
first campaign, of 785 (779) (223),  he inflicted a heavy defeat upon
the kingdom: about 30,000 inhabitants were taken captive and driven
away, extensive regions were turned into Urartian governorships,
and a heavy tribute was assessed for the remaining part of the Daiene
kingdom. Subsequently (according to Melikisvili--in 768 or 762;
the date is unreliable) Utupurshi, the king of Daiene, rebelled against
Urartu for the third time (224).  The fate of the kingdom is unclear,
since the text of Argishti I's chronicle is damaged here, but the name
of Daiene disappears from history from this time on (225).  In any event
there is no doubt that it no longer existed after the Cimmerian
invasion in the second half of the 8th century B.C. (about which
see below).
<p>
[87] In the east Argishti I continued to bypass Assyria in a flanking
maneuver and almost got to the borders of Babylonia in the valley
of the Diyala (226).
<p>
By the time of Sarduri lI's accession (c. 760 B.C.?) the Upper
Euphrates was indisputably recognized as the western frontier of
the Urartian Empire (227), and the Urartians tried vigorously to make
their way into Syria. At the beginning of his rule (228) Sarduri II defeated Hilaruandas, the king of Melid, who up to this time probably
had been the leader in the Northern Syrian Alliance, and apparently acquired from him some fortresses on the right (western) shore of the Euphrates (229).
<p>
Around 745 Sarduri II invaded Commagene (230) (which was about
to take advantage of the defeat of its neighbor, Melid, to seize part
of its territory) (231) and forced its king, Kushtashpili (232), to submit.
<p>
Thus the Northern Syrian alliance was now opposed not by one
powerful enemy, Assyria, but by two, who, although they were
rivals, were equally dangerous. In addition to this there appeared
the threat of Phrygia from the west, where it may have had, about
750 B.C., reached the northwestern slopes of the Cilician Taurus.
Such a danger forced Mattiel, the king of Arpad, to whom the hegemony within the alliance had passed, to try and find an independent power upon which he could lean. In 754 B.C., after the
Urartians had already defeated Melid, Mattiel had to swear an oath
of allegiance to Assurnerari IV, the king of Assyria (233).  But seeing
that Assyria, which was engaged in civil strife, did not have the
strength to act, the king of Arpad, representing the Northern Syrian alliance, turned to Bargaia, the king of the country of Kasku
(Aramaic <i>Katak</i>) (234).  However it turned out that this was an unreliable or insufficiently powerful support, so after the Urartian invasion of Commagene, Mattiel and the entire Northern Syrian alliance (235) considered it best to ally themselves with Sarduri II;
apparently the Southern Syrian alliance also supported Urartu.
<p>
At this moment Urartu may have surpassed Assyria in power.
The Urartian administrative system was so perfect that it possibly
served as the pattern for an administrative reform in Assyria as
well (236).  Already in Minua's time the Urartian army was reequipped
after the Assyrian fashion. At the beginning of his rule Sarduri II
felt it was possible to drastically reduce the obligatory military
service of freemen in his kingdom, obviously relying now more
on a standing army, maintained at the expense of the wealthy royal
treasury, which had been replenished by collecting taxes and tribute (237).  The entire Armenian Highlands (with the exception of the kingdoms of Shubria and Hubushkia) and a big part of central and western Transcaucasia were now subject to Urartu. The Urartians
[88] had not yet managed to become firmly established on the right
shore of the upper Euphrates, but they were readily acknowledged
as protectors by the Northern Syrian alliance.

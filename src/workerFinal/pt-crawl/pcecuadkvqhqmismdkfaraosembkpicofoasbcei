/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

          of Amazonian species distribution, and for his early admonition that

        <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#990000">[[p. 107]]</font> The great 

          valley of the Amazon is rich in species of Monkeys, and during my residence 

          there I had many opportunities of becoming acquainted with their habits 

          and distribution. The few observations I have to make will apply principally 

          to the latter particular. I have myself seen twenty-one species; seven 

          with prehensile and fourteen with non-prehensile tails, as shown in 

          the following list:-- 

        
      </p><blockquote> 
        <p><font size="-1">3 Howlers, viz.<i>--Mycetes ursinus</i>, <i>M. caraya? 
          </i>and <i>M. Beelzebub</i>;<br />
          1 Spider Monkey,<i>--Ateles paniscus</i>;<br />
          1 Big-bellied Monkey (<i>Barrigudo</i> of the Brazilians),<i>--Lagothrix 
          Humboldtii</i>;<br />
          2 Sapajou,<i>--Cebus gracilis</i> (Spix) and <i>C. apella?</i>;<br />
          4 Short-tailed Monkeys,<i>--Brachyurus couxiu</i>, <i>B. ouakari</i> 
          (Spix), <i>B. rubicundus</i> (<i>? Calvus</i>, B. M.), and a new species;<br />
          2 Sloth Monkeys,<i>--Pithecia irrorata</i> and an undescribed species;<br />
          3 Squirrel Monkeys,<i>--Callithrix sciureus</i>, <i>C. personatus</i> 
          and <i>C. torquatus</i>;<br />
          2 Nocturnal Monkeys,<i>--Nyctipithecus trivirgatus</i> and <i>N. felinus</i>; 
          and<br />
          3 Marmoset Monkeys,<i>--Jacchus bicolor</i>, <i>J. tamarin</i> and a 
          new species.</font></p>

        </blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Howling Monkeys are generally abundant; the different 

        species, however, are found in separate localities; <i>Mycetes Beelzebub</i> 

        being apparently confined to the Lower Amazon, in the vicinity of Para; 

        a black species, <i>M. caraya?</i>, to the Upper Amazon; and a red species, 

        <i>M. ursinus</i>, to the Rio Negro and Upper Amazon. Much confusion seems 

        to exist with regard to the species of Howlers, owing to the difference 

        of colour in the sexes of some species. The red and the black species 

        of the Amazon, however, are of the same colour in both sexes. The species 

        of this genus are seminocturnal in their habits, uttering their cries 

        late in the evening and before sunrise, and also on the approach of rain. 

        Humboldt observes, that the tremendous noise they make can only be accounted 

        for by the great numbers of individuals that unite in its production. 

        My own observations, and the unanimous testimony of the Indians, prove 

        this not to be the case. One individual only makes the howling, which 

        is certainly of a remarkable depth and volume and curiously modulated; 

        but on closely remarking the suddenness with which it ceases and <font color="#990000">[[p. 

        108]]</font> again commences, it is evident that it is produced by one 

        animal, which is generally a full-grown male. On dissecting the throat, 

        much of our wonder at the noise ceases; for besides the bony vessel formed 

        by the expanded &quot;os hyoides,&quot; there is a strong muscular apparatus which 

        seems to act as a bellows in forcing a body of air through the reverberating 

        bony cavity. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the genus <i>Ateles</i>, the four-fingered Spider 

          Monkeys, one species is found only in the Guiana district, north of 

          the Amazon and Rio Negro. Another, probably <i>Ateles ater</i>, inhabits 

          the West Brazil district on the river Purus. These monkeys are slow 

          in their motions, but make great use of their prehensile tail, by which 

          they swing themselves from bough to bough; and I have been informed 

          that two have been seen to join together by their hands and prehensile 

          tails, to form a bridge for their young ones to pass over. The Indians 

          also say, that this animal generally moves suspended beneath the boughs, 

          not walking on them. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next genus, <i>Lagothrix</i>, is a very interesting 

          one, being quite unknown in Guiana and Eastern Brazil. The species I 

          am acquainted with (<i>L. Humboldtii</i>) is found in the district south-west 

          of the Rio Negro, towards the Andes, which I call the Ecuador district 

          of the Amazon. They are remarkable for their thick woolly grey fur, 

          their long prehensile tails, and very mild disposition. In the upper 

          Amazon they are the species most frequently seen tame, and are great 

          favourites, from their grave countenances, more resembling the human 

          face than those of any other Monkeys, their quiet manners, and the great 

          affection and docility they exhibit. I had three of them for several 

          months before leaving Brazil, and they were on board with me at the 

          time the ship was burnt, when, with their companions, they all perished. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sapajou Monkeys, forming the genus <i>Cebus</i>, 

          appear to be more generally distributed, and the species have a wider 

          range. They are also frequently domesticated, but offer a remarkable 

          contrast to the species of the last genus, in their constant activity 

          and restlessness, and they have the character of being the most mischievous 

          monkeys in the country. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each species of the genus <i>Brachyurus</i> appears 

          to be confined to a particular district. The <i>B. couxiu</i> is a native 

          of Guiana, and does not pass the Rio Negro on the west, or the Amazon 

          on the south. The <i>B. ouakari</i> is found on the Upper Rio Negro; 

          the <i>B. rubicundus</i> on the Upper Amazon, called the Solimoes; and 

          another species, apparently undescribed, is found on the lower part 

          of the same river. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sloth Monkeys, forming the genus <i>Pithecia</i>, 

          have an extensive range as regards the genus, but the separate species 

          seem each confined in a limited space. Of the two species inhabiting 

          the Amazon district, one, the <i>P. irrorata</i>, is found on the south 

          bank of the Upper Amazon; and another, apparently undescribed and rendered 

          remarkable by a bright red beard round the face and under the chin, 

          occurs only to the south-west of the Rio Negro. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the little Squirrel Monkeys, one, the <i>Callithrix 

          sciureus</i>, a specimen <font color="#990000">[[p. 109]]</font> of 

          which is now in the Society's Gardens, has an extensive range, being 

          found on both banks of the Amazon and Rio Negro. The <i>C. torquatus</i>, 

          a white-collared species, is found only on the Upper Rio Negro, and 

          the <i>C. personatus</i> on the Upper Amazon. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the curious Nocturnal Monkeys forming the genus 

          <i>Nyctipithecus</i> there are two species in this district; one, which 

          appears to be the <i>N. trivirgatus</i> of Humboldt, is found in the 

          district of Ecuador, west of the Upper Rio Negro; the other, closely 

          allied, probably the <i>N. felinus</i>, on the Upper Amazon. Their large 

          eyes, cat-like faces, soft woolly hair and nocturnal habits render them 

          a very interesting group. They are called &quot;devil monkeys&quot; by the Indians, 

          and are said to sleep during the day and to roam about only at night. 

          I have had specimens of them alive, but they are very delicate and soon 

          die. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Marmoset Monkeys there are three species, 

          though none of them have the characteristic tufts of hair on the head. 

          Each species seems to be confined to a very limited tract of country. 

          The <i>Jacchus tamarin</i> is found only in the district of Para, where 

          it is abundant. The <i>J. bicolor</i>, a pretty grey and white species, 

          I have only seen on the Guiana side of the Rio Negro near the city of 

          Barra. Another species entirely black, with the face of bare white skin, 

          inhabits the district of the Upper Rio Negro. It appears to be quite 

          new. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last three genera appear to be to a great extent 

          insectivorous, and I am inclined to think they also devour small birds 

          and mammalia. At least those I have had alive would attempt to pull 

          into their cages any of my small birds which passed near. The little 

          black <i>Jacchus</i> last mentioned was particularly savage. He once 

          seized a large parrot by the neck, pulled him into his cage, and bit 

          out a large piece from his bill, and would probably have destroyed it, 

          had I not opportunely come to the rescue. Two other small birds which 

          approached too near his cage he seized and completely devoured. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now make a few remarks on the geographical 

          distribution of these animals. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the various works on natural history and in our 

          museums, we have generally but the vaguest statements of locality. S. 

          America, Brazil, Guiana, Peru, are among the most common; and if we 

          have &quot;River Amazon&quot; or &quot;Quito&quot; attached to a specimen, we may think 

          ourselves fortunate to get anything so definite: though both are on 

          the boundary of two distinct zoological districts, and we have nothing 

          to tell us whether the one came from the north or south of the Amazon, 

          or the other from the east or the west of the Andes. Owing to this uncertainty 

          of locality, and the additional confusion created by mistaking allied 

          species from distant countries, there is scarcely an animal whose exact 

          geographical limits we can mark out on the map. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this accurate determination of an animal's range 

          many interesting questions depend. Are very closely allied species ever 

          separated by a wide interval of country? What physical features determine 

          <font color="#990000">[[p. 110]]</font> the boundaries of species and 

          of genera? Do the isothermal lines ever accurately bound the range of 

          species, or are they altogether independent of them? What are the circumstances 

          which render certain rivers and certain mountain ranges the limits of 

          numerous species, while others are not? None of these questions can 

          be satisfactorily answered till we have the range of numerous species 

          accurately determined.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my residence in the Amazon district I took 

          every opportunity of determining the limits of species, and I soon found 

          that the Amazon, the Rio Negro and the Madeira formed the limits beyond 

          which certain species never passed. The native hunters are perfectly 

          acquainted with this fact, and always cross over the river when they 

          want to procure particular animals, which are found even on the river's 

          bank on one side, but never by any chance on the other. On approaching 

          the sources of the rivers they cease to be a boundary, and most of the 

          species are found on both sides of them. Thus several Guiana species 

          come up to the Rio Negro and Amazon, but do not pass them; Brazilian 

          species on the contrary reach but do not pass the Amazon to the north. 

          Several Ecuador species from the east of the Andes reach down into the 

          tongue of land between the Rio Negro and Upper Amazon, but pass neither 

          of those rivers, and others from Peru are bounded on the north by the 

          Upper Amazon, and on the east by the Madeira. Thus there are four districts, 

          the Guiana, the Ecuador, the Peru and the Brazil districts, whose boundaries 

          on one side are determined by the rivers I have mentioned. 

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In going up the Rio Negro the difference in the 

          two sides of the river is very remarkable. 

        
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the lower part of the river you will find on the 
        north the <i>Jacchus bicolor</i> and the <i>Brachyurus Couxiu</i>, and 
        on the south the red-whiskered <i>Pithecia</i>. Higher up you will find 
        on the north the <i>Ateles paniscus</i>, and on the south the new black 
        <i>Jacchus</i> and the <i>Lagothrix Humboldtii</i>. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spix, in his work on the monkeys of Brazil, frequently 

          gives, &quot;banks of the river Amazon&quot; as a locality, not being aware apparently 

          that the species found on one side very often do not occur on the other, 

          though the fact is generally known to the natives. In these observations 

          I have only referred to the monkeys, but the same ph&aelig;nomena occur 

          both with birds and insects, as I have observed in many instances.</p>

After which come such like round cases and Seed as in the other Mallows. The Roots are many and long, shooting from one Head, of the bigness of a Thumb or Finger, very pliant, tough and bending like Liquoris, of a whitish yellow colour on the outside, and more white within, full of a slimy juyce which being, layd in water will thicken it as if it were gelly....</font></p>      <p align="center"><font size="-1"><img src="mallowbb.jpg" width="450" height="599" border="5"></font></p>            <p><font size="-1"><em>Vertues and Use</em> -- The Leavs of either of the sorts above named, and the Roots also boyled in Wine or Water, or in Broth, with Parsley or Fennel Roots, doth help to open the Body, and is very convenient in hot Agues or other distempers of the Body to apply the Leavs so boyled warm to the Belly; It not only voideth hot Chollerick and other offensive Humors, but easeth the pains and torments of the Belly coming thereby; and are therefore used in all Clysters conducing to those purposes: The same used by Nurses, procureth them store of Milk. </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">The Decoction of the Seed of any of the common Mallows, made in Milk or Wine doth Merveilously help excoriations, the Phtisick, Plurisie, and other Diseases of the Chest and Lungues that proceed of hot causes, if it be continued taking for sometime together: The Leavs and Roots work the same effects: They help much also in the excoriations of the Guts and Bowels and hardness of the Mother, and in all hot and sharp diseases thereof. The Juyce drunk in Wine, or the Decoction of them therein doth help Women to a speedy and easie Delivery. Pliny saith, That whosoever shal take a spoonful of any of the Mallows, shal that day be free from all Diseases that may come unto him; and that it is special good for the Falling-sickness. The Syrup also and Conserve made of the Flowers are very effectual for the same Diseases, and to open the Body being costive: </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">The Leavs bruised and laid to the Eyes with a little Honey, taketh away the Impostumations of them. The Leavs bruised or rubbed upon any place stung with Bees, Wasps or the like, presently taketh away the pains, redness, and Swellings that rise thereupon: and Dioscorides saith, The Decoction of the Leavs and Roots helpeth all sorts of Poyson, so as the Poyson be presently voided by Vomit. A Pultis made of the Leavs boyled and bruised, whereunto some Bean or Barley Flower and Oyl of Roses is an especial Remedy against all hard Tumors and Inflamations of Impostums and Swellings of the Cods and other parts, and easeth the pains of them; as also against the hardness of the Liver or Spleen, being applied to the places. </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">The Juyce of the Mallows boyled in old Oyl and applied, taketh away al roughness of the Skin, as also the Scurf, Dandrif, or dry Scabs in the Head or other parts if they be anointed therewith, or washed with the Decoction, and preserveth the Hair from falling off. It is also effectual against Scaldings and Burnings, St. Anthonies fire, and all other hot, red, and painful Swellings in any part of the Body. The Flowers boyled in Oyl or Water (as every one is disposed) wherunto a little Honey and Allum is put, is an excellent Gargle to wash, clens, and heal any sore Mouth or Throat in a short space. If the Feet be bathed or washed with the Decoction of the Leavs, Roots, and Flowers, it helpeth much the Defluxions of Rhewm from the Head. If the Head be washed therewith, it staieth the falling and shedding of the Hair. The green Leavs (saith Pliny) beaten with Nitre and applied draweth out Thorns, or Pricks in the Flesh. </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">The Marsh Mallows are more effectual in al the Diseases before mentioned: The Leavs are likewise used to loosen the Belly gently, and in Decoctions for Clysters, to eas al pains of the Body, opening the strait Passages, and making them slippery, whereby the Stone may descend the more easily and without pain, out of the Reins, Kidneys, and Bladder, and to eas the torturing pains thereof: But the Roots are of more especial use for those purposes, as well as for Coughs, Hoarsness, shortness of Breath, and Wheesings, being boyled in Wine or Honeyed Water and drunk. The Roots and Seeds hereof boyled in Wine or Water, is with good success used by them that have Excoriations in the Guts, or the bloody Flux, by qualifying the violence of the sharp fretting Humors, easing the pains, and healing the Soreness: It is profitably taken of them that are troubled with Ruptures, Cramps, or Convulsions of the Sinews; and boyled in white Wine for the Impostumes of the Throat, commonly called the Kings Evil, and of those Kernels that rise behind the Ears, and Inflamations or Swellings in Womens Breasts. </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">The dried Roots boyled in Milk and drunk is special good for the Chin-Cough. Hippocrates used to give the Decoction of the Roots, or the Juyce therof to drink to those that were wounded, and ready to faint through loss of Blood, and applied the same, mixed with Honey and Rozin to the Wounds: As also the Roots boyled in Wine to those that had received any Hurt by Bruises, Falls, or Blows, or had any Bone or Member out of Joynt, or any Swelling pain, or ach in the Muscles, Sinews, or Arteries. The Muccilage of the Roots, and of Linseed, and of Fennugreek put together, is much used in Pultises, Oyntments, and plaisters, to mollifie and digest all hard Swellings, and the Inflamation of them, and to eas pains in any part of the Body. The Seed either green or dry mixed with Vinegar clenseth the Skin of the Morphew, and al other discolourings, being bathed therewith in the Sun. </font></p>      <font size="-1">You may remember that not long since there was a raging Disease called the Bloody Flux, the Colledg of Physitians not knowing what to make of it, called it the Plague in the Guts, for their wits were at ne plus ultra about it.

Agrippa saith, That if Women that cannot conceive by reason of the moist slipperiness of their Wombs shall take a quantity of the Juyce of Sage with a little Salt for four daies before they company with their Husbands, it will help them not only to Conceive, but also to retain the Birth without miscarrying. Orpheus saith, Three spoonfuls of the Juyce of Sage taken fasting with a little Honey, doth presently stay the spitting or casting up of Blood. For them that are in a consumption, these Pills are much commended. Take of Spicknard and Ginger of each two drams; of the Seed of Sage toasted at the fire, eight drams, of long Pepper twelve drams, all these being brought into fine Pouder, put thereto so much Juyce of Sage as may make them into a Mass for Pills, taking a dram of them every morning fasting, and so likewise at night, drinking a little pure Water after them. Mathiolus saith, it is very profitable for all manner of pains of the Head coming of cold and Rhewmatick Humors, as also for all pains of the Joynts, whether used inwardly or outwardly, and therfore helpeth the Falling-sickness, the Lethargy, such as are dull and heavy of spirit, the Palsey, and is of much use in all Defluxions of Rhewm from the Head, and for the Diseases of the Chest or Breast.

Sage is of excellent use to help the Memory, warming and quickning the senses; and the Conserve made of the Flowers is used to the same purpose, and also for all the former recited Diseases. The Juyce of Sage drunk with Vinegar hath been of good use in the time of Plague at all times. Gargles likewise are made with Sage, Rosemary, Honeysuckles, and Plantane boyled in Wine or Water, with some Honey and Allum put thereto, to wash sore Mouthes and Throats, Cankers, or the secret parts of man or woman as need requireth. And with other hot and comfortable Herbs. Sage is boyled to bath the Body or Legs in the Summer time, especially to warm cold Joynts or Sinews troubled with the Palsey or Cramp, and to comfort and strengthen the parts.

The Juyce mixed with som Pouder of Brimstone, is not only good against the Itch, but taketh away al discolourings of the Skin whatsoever: And if it chance that in a tender Body it causeth any Itching or Inflamation, by bathing the place with a little Vinegar it is helped. </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">This is an Herb of the Sun, &amp; under the Coelestial Lyon, and is one of the best cures for the Eyes that is. Al that know any thing in Astrologie, know as wel as I can tel them, That the Eyes are subject to the Luminaries; let it then be gathered when the Sun is in Leo, and the Moon in Aries applying to his Trine; let Leo arise, then may you make it into an Oyl or Oyntment which you please to anoint your sore Eyes withal: I can prove it both by my own experience, and the experience of those to whom I have taught it, That most desperat sore Eyes have been cured by this only Medicine; And then I pray, is not this farbetter than endangering the Eyes by the art of the Needle? for if this do not absolutly take away the Film, it wil so facilitate the work that it may be don wihout danger. </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">Another il-favored trick have Physitians got to use to the Eye, and that is worse than the Needle; which is, To eat away the Film by corroding or gnawing Medicines.

The Callus or Film that they would eat away is seldom of an equal thickness in every place, and then the Tunicle may be eaten asunder in one place, before the Film be consumed in another, and so be a readier way to extinguish the sight than to restore it. </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">It is called Chelidonium from the Greek word <em>chelidon</em> which signifies a Swallow, because they say, That if you prick out the Eyes of yong Swallows when they are in the Nest, the old ones wil recover their Eyes again with this Herb. This I am confident, for I have tried it, That if you mar the very Apple of their Eyes with a Needle, she wil recover them again, but whether with this Herb or no I know not. </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">Also I have read (and it seems to be somwhat probable) That the Herb being gathered as I shewed before, and the Elements drawn apart from it by the art of the Alchymist, and after they are drawn apart, rectified, the earthy quality still in rectifying them, added to the Terra damnata (as Alchymists call it) or Terra sacratissima (as som Phylosophers call it) the Elements so rectified are sufficient for the Cure of al Diseases, the humor offending being known and the contrary Element given, It is an Experience wurth the trying, and can do no harm.</font></p></td>    </tr>  <tr>    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC">If in your teeth you hap to be tormented,       <br>      By meane some little wormes therein do breed,<br>            Which paine (if heed be tane) may be preuented,      <br>      By keeping cleane your teeth, when as you feede:<br>      Burne Frankomsence (a gum not euil sented),       <br>      Put Henbane vnto this, and Onyon-seed,      <br>      And in a Tunnel to the tooth that's hollow,       <br>      Conuey the smoake thereof, and ease shall follow.       <br>      By Nuts, Oyle, Eeles, and cold in head<br>      By Apples and raw fruites is hoarsness bred. </td>    <td bgcolor="#66CCCC">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr bgcolor="#339999">    <td colspan="2"><strong>HENBANE</strong> (from Culpeper, p. 64):      <p><font size="-1">Our common Henbane hath very large, thick, soft, wooly Leavs lying upon the ground, much cut in or torn on the edges of a dark ill grayish green colour, among which rise up divers thick &amp; short Stalks two or three foot high, spread into divers smaller Branches with lesser Leavs on them, and many hollow Flowers scarce appearing above the Husks, and usually torn on the one side, ending in five round points growing one above another, of a deadish yellow colour, somwhat paler toward the edges, with many purplish Veins therein, and of a dark yellowish purple in the bottom of the Flower, with a smal pointel of the same colour in the middle, each of them standing in hard close Husk, which after the Flower is past, groweth very like the Husk of Asarabacca, and somwhat sharp at the top Points, wherein is contained much smal Seed very like Poppy Seed, but of a dusky grayish colour.

And applied with Vinegar to the Forehead and Temples, helpeth the Headach and want of sleep in hot Feavers. The Juyce of the Herb or Seed, or the Oyl drawn from the Seed doth the like. The Oyl of the Seed is helpful for the Deafness, Nois, and Worms in the Ears, being dropped therein; the Juyce of the Herb, or Root doth also the same. The Decoction of the Herb, or Seed, or both, killeth Lice in Man and Beast. The fume of the dried Herb Stalks and Seed burned, quickly healeth Swellings, Chilblains, or Kibes in the Hands or Feet, by holding them in the fume thereof. The Remedy to help those that have taken Henbane is to drink Goats Milk, Honyed Water or Pine Kernels, with Sweet Wine: or in the absence of these, Fennel Seed, Nettle Seed, the Seed of Cresses, Mustard, or Radish, as also Onions, or Garlick taken in Wine, do all help to free them from danger, and restore them to their due temper again. </font></p>      <p><font size="-1">Take notice that this Herb must never be taken inwardly, outwardly, an Oyl, Oyntment, or Plaister of it, is most admirable for the Gout, to cool the Venerial heat of the Reins in the French Pox, to stop the Toothach being applied to the aching side, to allay all Inflamations, and to help the Diseases before premised....</font></p>    </td>    </tr></table><center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="600" ><tr>  <td>&nbsp;

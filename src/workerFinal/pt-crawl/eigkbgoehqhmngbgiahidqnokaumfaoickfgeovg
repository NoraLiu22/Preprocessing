<h2>The Song of the Deer Mouse</h2>
<p>
Several times, I have read of someone who kept a pet deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus)
who reported that it 'sang' to itself, with a beautiful musical sound.
<p>
The spring of 2000 was unusually early - I had bees at my crocuses 23 March, a week before my prior
earliest record. Then, 7 April, we had a quick reversion to winter. A young deer mouse from the colony
that lives under my shed found its way into the house, and made it under a door into a closet an inch ahead of
my Puss. I rescued it, and installed it in an old aquarium with food and water until warm weather returned and I could safely release it.
(A photo of an adult member of the colony is on my <a href="mammals.html">mammals page</a>.)
<p>
It promptly began to sing to itself! And, once it got accustomed to a microphone placed close to
its favourite resting spot, I got a recording.
<p>
<a href="peromyscus.wav">As you can hear</a>, it's as musical as described. It can be heard about 3&nbsp;m away in a
quiet house. It must be analogous in use to a cat's purr, to bond to its nestmates - it would clearly
be counterproductive out in the open.

<p><small>I apologize for the brevity of the recording, but it was made before MP3 existed and
when I only had 1&nbsp;MB of web space. It actually sang like this for up to half an hour at
a time.</small>

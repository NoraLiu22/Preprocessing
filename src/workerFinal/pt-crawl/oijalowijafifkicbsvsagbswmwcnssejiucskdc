  </div><br />&nbsp;<p>Emma became interested in space through reading science fiction as a child. She also became obsessed with mathematical problems. Emma went to an all girl&rsquo;s school and was one of only two people who took physics.&nbsp; Tests at school showed that not only was she slightly dyslexic but that she had also very poor arithmetic skills and very little visual memory.&nbsp; Emma has very strong views on how physics is taught in schools and has become involved in a programme that places post-graduate students in the classroom. She aims to encourage children not to be scared of physics and maths.</p><p><br />Most of her Emma&rsquo;s work involves finding and manipulating equations to solve cosmological problems. Her undergraduate work took ideas from particle physics and applied them to cosmological theory. Her current work looks at creating mathematical models to explain an observational riddle. She has taken equations from the work of the famous Russian Zeldovich and applied them to her problems. Her initial results have started to be applied to data sets and are looking really promising.</p><p><br />Emma finds that her best work comes to mind when she is distracted by her pass-times: live-role play, Kung Fu and Broadsword fighting, playing the harp, science fiction and drama!</p><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><span class="bold_title">Links To Other Information:</span><p /><strong><a href="http://emmajking.co.im">Emma J King</a></strong><br />Link to the website of Emma J King<p /><strong><a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/am_i_normal.shtml'>Link to Radio 4 Am I normal</a></strong><br />Radio 4 series including interview on Maths and Dyscalculia featuring Emma J King.<br />&nbsp;</div>

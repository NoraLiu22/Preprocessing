      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Some articles 
        here and in other published literature on iguanas speaks to the behavior 
        of male iguanas towards humans during the iguana breeding season, in particular, 
        the increased aggression of some (not all) male iguanas towards their 
        human female during the female's monthly cycles during the iguana breeding 
        season.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Many humans 
        are amazed to find out that most animals can tell the difference between 
        human males and human females. Not only can they tell us apart, however, 
        but they know when human females are going through their monthly cycles. 
        Most animals are better at detecting pheromenal (hormonal) changes in 
        their own species than we humans now are with other humans. Some animals, 
        such as the green iguanas, have special chemosensory organs, such as the 
        iguana's vomeronasal (Jacobson's) organ, used to detect these hormones.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">In iguanas, 
        this results in their not only being able to smell the chemical cues laid 
        down by other male iguanas who have marked their territories by dragging 
        their thighs (and the protruding scent-laden waxy femoral pore plugs) 
        along ground and branches (and, in captivity, the carpet, couch and other 
        surfaces the iguana is allowed upon), but in being able to detect the 
        subtle changes in their female keepers. Iguanas can tell when their female 
        humans are menstruating and ovulating. Human females who have been spay--, 
        er, have had a partial or complete hysterectomy, or who are post-menopausal, 
        are still cycling hormonally every month, and the iguanas are able to 
        detect these hormones even in their greatly reduced amounts. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Whether 
        the male iguanas (or female iguanas, since they can tell, too) actually 
        care is another thing. Out of all the males I have had through here in 
        the past 3 years (numbering 80-90 iguanas), I have seen some minor behavioral 
        changes in just a handful. These minor changes included their hanging 
        around watching me or remaining in close proximity more during my menses 
        and ovulation times than at other times of the month - but only during 
        <i>their</i> breeding season. Only two iguanas, both, interestingly enough, 
        Peruvians (or so I am told - both were highly blue all over with reddish 
        eyes and darkly pigmented eyelids) actually became aggressive towards 
        human males who came near me, flirtatious (so to speak) with other human 
        females, and enamored of me. Of the two of them, Elvys behaved differently 
        than did Freddy during these times.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Elvys 
        never tried to actively mate with me although, during my menstrual periods, 
        he became more clingy than during the rest of the month. Outside of the 
        season, he was completely tame and sociable, regularly soliciting attention 
        and physical contact. During his breeding season and my periods, he got 
        extremely hatchety (extended legs, lateral body compression, ritualized 
        body/tail movements and bobbing) when I wore blue, purple or green. He 
        also would increasingly display at human males, and would charge other 
        human females. He would even stalk around human males, especially men 
        new to him, and very deliberately place one of his forefeet on their foot, 
        making it very clear (to me, if not to the human in question) that he, 
        Elvys, was the dominant male.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Freddy<a name="freddy"></a>, 
        on the other hand, tried to mate with me every year during &quot;our&quot; 
        season (his season, me premenstrual or in menses - doing nothing, I assure 
        you, to make me any less cranky!). The first year I had him, he launched 
        himself right at my neck - twice. This resulted in fingers on both my 
        hands being severely torn and infected for a couple of months. After that, 
        he restrained himself and just went for my hands. I have the most interesting 
        scars laced around my fingers, wrists and palm. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Freddy, 
        too, was more excited when I was wearing &quot;iguana&quot; colors. He 
        always clearly communicated when he was looking to grab me. He became 
        a better indicator to me of my cycles than my calendar was. When he did 
        nail me, it was because I was tired, or being stupid. Like the early evening 
        when I was still wearing a T-shirt printed all over with green iguanas 
        that I had worn that day to a full-day education event. Instead of changing 
        when I came home and resting before spending time with Fred, I responded 
        to his solicitation for attention by petting him and not paying close 
        enough attention to his very clear signals. Oh, and yes, I got my period 
        the very next day. Eventually, there were a few things he found to use 
        as a surrogate for me. He even used them when I wasn't home (see the <i>Transference</i> 
        section in the <a href="breedingaggression.html#freddy">Dealing with Breeding 
        Aggression</a> article).</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Iguana 
        males attacking menstruating human females was first described in the 
        literature in 1991by male reptile veterinarians (Frye, FL, D.R. Mader 
        and B.V. Centofanti. 1991. Interspecific (Lizard:Human) Sexual Aggression 
        in Captive Iguanas (<i>Iguana iguana</i>). <i>Journal of the ARAV 1</i>(1):4). 
        I have been the only one that I know of to report (albeit informally, 
        and subsequently confirmed by other women in the AOL Green Iguana forum 
        and in the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/IguanaMail">Iguanas 
        Mailing List</a>) of some males iguanas responding to human females during 
        ovulation. In talking with other female iguana owners, I find that some 
        of these women, too, see a change in their iguana's behavior when they 
        are ovulating rather than when they are menstruating; some report male 
        iguana behavioral changes during both times of the month.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Frye, 
        et al., reported that male iguanas who were &quot;closely&quot; raised 
        by human females - with the igs eating with the human female, sleeping 
        with them, showering with them, etc. - being most likely to get aggressive 
        during breeding season/menstruation. I found just the opposite: Elvys 
        and Fred came to me when they were both 7 years old; Elvys was raised 
        by a male; Fred by a male/female couple (I rescued Fred after he had been 
        languishing for over a year on consignment in a pet store). On the other 
        hand is my Wally, who, from the time his body was the length of my thumb, 
        napped with me, showered with me, was frequently out and about with me, 
        slept in my room (though not in bed with me). Wally, however, could basically 
        care less about me during breeding season. During his first season, he 
        did hang around me a lot when I was ovulating (walking up to me, putting 
        a foot on me, staring at me with a rather dazed and confused look in his 
        eye). Later that first season mated with my female iguana. Since that 
        first year, he hasn't altered his behavior towards me at all during his 
        season, treating me the same in season as he does out, regardless of where 
        I am in my monthly cycle.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The important 
        thing to remember is that the tamer your iguana is before the start of 
        his first breeding season, the easier it is going to be to deal with him 
        during the season so long as you are aware of what to look for. If you 
        are a human female, be aware not only of triggers that may set him off, 
        but see if you can correlate any changes in his behavior during his season 
        with your own monthly cycles. If you are a human male, be aware that you 
        may be considered as a competitor for territory and, if you live with 
        a sexually mature human female, as competition for mates, as well. My 
        article on <a href="breedingaggression.html">Dealing with Breeding Aggression</a> 
        discusses the triggers and what can be done to mitigate your behavior 
        to reduce the intensity or occurrence of aggression.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, 
        remember that not all males get aggressive during their season, and not 
        all will try to mate with their human female keepers. At the present time, 
        I have five males, all sexually mature, and none of them are aggressive 
        to me during their respective breeding seasons.</font></p>

        iguanas act differently towards them when they are ovulating or menstruating. 
        The behavioral changes are benign: the female spends more time in the 
        presence of the human, tolerates, solicits, or fails to terminate contact 
        with the human as they would do when outside of breeding season and other 
        times of the human female's monthly cycle.</font></font></p>

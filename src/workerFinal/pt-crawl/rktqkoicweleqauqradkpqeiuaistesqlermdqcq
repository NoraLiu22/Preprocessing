<h3>1. The Armenian Highlands and the Hittite Empire</h3>
It was only the western and southwestern outskirts of the Armenian Highlands that from time to time entered into the structure of the Hittite and Mitannian Empires. We have but very limited
information from the written sources about the areas that were
directly contiguous with the borders of these empires. We are
therefore compelled to consider events in the outside world before we can attempt to understand what was happening in the Highlands.
<hr>
<h3>1.1. The Political Situation in the Middle of the 2nd Millennium B.C.</h3>
As we have seen in the preceding chapter, the Hittite Old Kingdom arose in the 19th-17th centuries in central Asia Minor to the west of the Armenian Highlands. In the 17th-16th centuries B.C. it began its advance to the south, into Syria, but beginning from the
second quarter of that century it experienced a serious decline
and lost its peripheral possessions. In the 16th century the Mitannian Empire was advancing from northern Mesopotamia, gradually
subjecting to its control the small kingdoms of Syria (Halpa [formerly Yamhad]), Carchemish, Mukise-Alalakh, and others). It also
probably came to control the Cilician Taurus (Kizzuwadna) (1),  as
well as part of the valley of the Upper Euphrates and the area to
the south of the Armenian Taurus. Temporarily it also dominated
the areas along the central Tigris and beyond the Tigris (Assur, Arrapkhe) (2).  Attacks by Egyptian forces in the middle of the 15th
century led to a weakening of Mitanni, which lost its possessions
to the west of the Euphrates; nevertheless, around 1400 B.C. Mitanni was still flourishing. Its king at this time was Dushratta, who
maintained friendly relations with--indeed was an ally of--the
Egyptian pharaoh Amenhetep III (3).
<p>
[42]
In the meantime the period of weakness in the Hittite Empire
came to an end, and it again consolidated in the central part of
Asia Minor. From this time on we also have written data on that
area of the Armenian Highlands which was involved in the stream
of historical events determined by the actions of the great powers.
</p><hr>
<h3>1.2. The Society of the Armenian Highlands in the 2nd
Millennium B.C.</h3>
The society of the Armenian Highlands during this period apparently stood on a level of development similar to the conthtion
of the society of Asia Minor at the time when the merchant-colonists from Assur penetrated there, and when the process of forming the first city-states was underway. As shown by the magnificent tombs of the tribal chiefs in Transcaucasia (in Trialeti and Kirovakan) dating from the first half of the second millennium B.C., economic and social stratification of the communities, which had begun to split up into a military aristocracy and rank-and-flle community members, was already far advanced here (*1). The further development of animal husbandry , and the accompanying growth in
wealth of the individual tribes and clans must have led to a greater
significance of war for the economy, while the development of
specialized types of agriculture (gardening as opposed to farming)
must have led to the appearance of intercommunity exchange, credit
in the form of money and grain-lending, and to social inequality.
<p>
The tombs of the tribal chiefs in Lchashen near Lake Sevan, dating
from the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C., with their ritual
of cremation, wooden funeral chariots, and rich funerary gifts, are
similar in type to the tombs of Trialeti and Kirovakan, but present
new features which show the further development of society. Even
greater numbers of slaves were buried with the tribal chiefs to
accompany them to the other world. On the one hand this bears
witness to a rise in the number of slaves, but on the other hand
it means that the slavery was economically of a most primitive
type; in the future slaves would represent a value which could not
be squandered in the form of human sacrifices. We must not forget, however, that mass extermination of captives was still practiced in Assyria and Urartu as late as the 9th-8th centuries B.C. (4)
</p><p>
In Trialeti and Kirovakan we observe stylistic similarities between handicraft objects there and comparable objects from Asia Minor and the Hurrian territory. In Lchashen (14th or 13th centuries B.C.) there appear articles which were either imported directly
from these countries or are exactly like the articles used among
the Hurrians of the south (5).  The chariots and arms of Lchashen (as,
e.g., the characteristic combed helmet), were analogous to the
[43] Hurrian. Seals of the Mitannian elaborate style have been found
not only in Lchashen but also in one of the burial grounds of the
Greater Caucasus (6).  This inthcates that by the end of the 2nd millennium B.C. the Armenian Highlands and Transcaucasia were beginning to be involved in international exchange. As we have seen, such exchange played a very important role in accelerating the
formation of class society in Asia Minor. For the Armenian Highlands the beginning of exploitation of copper and other metal deposits in Transcaucasia were also probably of vital importance.
</p><p>
We may imagine the society of the Armenian Highlands and Transcaucasia by the end of the 2nd millennium B.C. as being similar to that of the Hittites and the southern Hurrians some centuries earlier (as described in the preceding chapter). Patriarchal clans must
have been divided into separate extended-family economies subject to the authority of the patriarch--<i>ewri</i> (this word is also
preserved in Urartian) (7).  There would be a technically inalienable
and regularly reallotted land fund of the family commune, but the
individual families must have begun to be economically differentiated. This latter development resulted in a need for credit, which
inevitably led to the development of usury and debtor slavery.
</p><p>
This picture is not a mere supposition: however scant our information about the Urartian society of the Armenian Highlands of the first half of the lst millennium B.C. is, there do exist data which bear witness to the continued presence of large patriarchal families and familial or clan settlements, for instance, of settlements of the king's kinsmen (8).
</p><p>
We have seen that the Hurrian patriarchal families of the south
were parts of territorial communities governed by a council of
elders and a popular assembly. Some of them grew so large that
they included several villages, organized either according to familial or territorial principles, and inhabited both by related and unrelated extended families. Judging by the data on the family settlements in the  Urartian state, similar phenomena also existed in
the Highlands. We know about councils of elders and popular assemblies among the population of the Armenian Highlands also from Hittite sources.
</p><p>
Among the Hurrians of the south the territorial communities
constituted the backbone of an essentially new organization, that
of the city-state, headed by a prince ruling conjointly with a council. Later the city-states were sometimes subordinated to a loose, larger unity which we term a kingdom. However in the Armenian Highlands in the 2nd millennium B.C. matters had not yet gone so
far.
</p><p>
We have been accustomed to think about the social organization [44] 
of the Armenian and Iranian Highlands at the time preceding the
creation of the great empires of Urartu, Media, Persia, etc., as being
one of tribal organization. However we must not ignore the fact
that the most ancient Oriental sources, particularly the Hittite and
the Assyrian, only extremely rarely mention "tribes" in these territories. References to ethnic groups actually appear in these sources
only when they deal with general appellations referring to areas
not confined to one particular thstrict. Such terms are, e.g.,  <i>Kaska</i> 
in the Hittite sources, and  <i>Madai</i>  ("Medes") in the Assyrian sources.
Sometimes the Assyrian inscriptions also speak about "the countries of the Subareans," about the "countries of Nairi," about the "countries of the Uruatri" (Urartians), or about the "countries (or
country) of the Etio" (Etiuni). Only in two instances do they actually mean tribal units: the Hittite sources refer to the  <i>Kaska</i>  as a nonsettled population (Akk  <i>suti</i> ) (9),  and mention "twelve" of  "nine  tribes of the  <i>Kaska</i> ," (10)  and Herodotus informs us that the Medes constituted a federation of six tribes. Also in some other instances
such appellations may stand for loose groups of independent tribes.
</p><p>
However in the overwhelming majority of cases, ethnic designations do not appear in the sources. Instead they mention the small, organizationally compact territories--so-called "countries" (Hitt.  <i>utne</i>, Urart.  <i>ebane</i> , Assyr.  <i>matu</i>  or  <i>nagu</i> ). A "chief" of such a "country" is not designated by any specific title but is given the
epithet "(the one) of this or that country" with the determinative
of person (11).
</p><p>
The very nature of the Highlands required a certain territorial
subdivision of the population. The Armenian Highlands, just like the
Zagros Mountains in Western Iran, consists of enclosed valleys and
segments of valleys (Arm.  <i>gawar'</i> ). In antiquity the isolation of these
valleys was even more pronounced because of dense thickets and
forests which covered the mountain slopes and blocked up the
ravines and the passes. Consequently a tribe which might have
settled in two or three contiguous valleys would not have been
able to maintain its organizational unity except in extraordinary
circumstances, for example, during the formation of temporary
military alliances (12).
</p><p>
Therefore, here, even before the original communal structure of
society had broken down, territorial formations ("countries" in the
terminology of the ancient sources) were being created. Each such
"country" had its own council of elders, a popular assembly, and
a chieftain (military commander and administrator). In case of military necessity it could join confederacies and enter alliances (which probably still had a tribal character), and act in concert with other "countries." Thus these were simultaneously both territorial and 
[45]  tribal units, either coinciding with the tribe or constituting its subdivisions; in practice the "countries" had more real significance than the tribe itself.
</p><p>
Below we shall use the term "country" always in this specific
sense, dropping the quotation marks.
</p><p>
The situation described makes it extremely hard for the historian to establish the moment of the changeover to class society and state, since the territorial division of society, which usually.
may be regarded as a trustworthy criterion for the appearance of
state structure, cannot be applied as such in this case.
</p><p>
Other signs of the presence of class civilization and state (the
existence of taxes, armed forces separate from the populace, governmental officials, and, first of all, the very class structure of society itself) cannot be discovered on the strength of the existing
sources. We have to turn to less reliable secondary features, such
as the presence of writing; though its emergence is not necessarily
synchronous with the emergence of state, it usually is (13).  Moreover
we cannot always be sure that further excavations will not uncover written texts in places where we may not have expected them.
</p><hr>
<h3>1.3. Political Units and Tribes of the Annenian Highlands in the Middle of the 2nd Millennium B.C.</h3>
The first historical data on the countries and tribes of the Armenian Highlands are contained in the Hittite sources. Unfortunately they give information almost exclusively about the regions
which were directly contiguous with the eastern boundary of the
Hittite state. From the 14th century B.C. this boundary was the
Upper Euphrates. The northernmost country situated to the east
of the  <i>Kaska</i>  tribal union and the Hittite Empire, was Haiasa-Azzi (14).
It is still uncertain whether these two name--"Azzi" and "Haiasa"--
refer to two interconnected units, or whether they are different
appellations for one and the same unit.
<p>
It has often been suggested that Haiasa should be sought on the
upper reaches of the Euphrates around modern Erzincan and Erzurum. This, however, does not fit very well with the fact that, according to the data of the annals of the Hittite king Mursilis II,
one of the most important fortresses of Azzi, Aripsa, was situated
on the shore of the sea. There is no ambiguity in the text. In locating Haiasa-Azzi we must also take into consideration the fact that the ancient "countries" were situated along the valleys and
not across the mountain ranges. In all probability the dual name
"Haiasa-Azzi" is explained by the fact that this country consisted
of two parts, situated in two adjacent valleys. Moreover  judging [46] 
by the sources, Azzi was located nearer to the original core of the
Hittite kingdom, and Haiasa farther from it. If we do not assume
along with G. A. Kapantsjan that the sea on which Aripsa was located was a little swampy lake near Erzurum (which seems barely likely), then we must acknowledge that Azzi was located in Pontus, extending to the Black Sea, lying probably in the valley of the
river Harsit. In that case we can place Haiasa in the valley of the
river Choroh, near modern Bayburt. From there its power could
temporarily extend as far as the Euphrates (15).
</p><p>
Haiasa-Azzi should be viewed as a tribal confederation, even
though the Hittite source calls its ruler a "king." At any rate the
"king" of Haiasa appears, in the treaties with the Hittite king, on
an equal footing with the "people of Haiasa" (in all probability the
tribal assembly). The conditions of the treaty also extend to a certain person whose title is not specified, presumably the chief of Azzi. Later we will dwell on the data about the social structure of Haiasa in more detail. In Chapter Three we will examine the question of the ethnic affiliation of the Haiasans. For the time being we will only note that the small number of proper names of men and deities, as well as place names, which have come down to us from
Azzi and Haiasa, cannot be assigned with complete certainty to any
of the languages known to us. Attempts have been made to etymologize them from Hurrian (16) (Kapantsjan) (17) or from an unknown Indo-European language (G. B. Djahukyan) (18)  but in view of the extreme scarcity of material, all of the proposed etymologies are very
unreliable. If we place Azzi in Pontus, the most plausible vernacular which the Haiasans might have spoken would be a language of the Hat tic or Northwestern Caucasian group (19).  Also the Hurrians are a not improbable source of Haiasan culture and possibly
of their language. One way or another the problem of the Haiasans'
linguistic affiliation has not been solved. Not a single scholar has
been able to present any well-founded data in favor of their speaking any sort of Armenian, and, as we shall see, their having done so is highly unlikely. We will return to this question in more detail later.
</p><p>
South of Azzi, on the upper reaches of the Euphrates, were situated Pahhuwa on the right and Zuhma (or, in Akkadian, Suhmu) (20) on the left bank of the river. To the south of Zuhma, along the left bank of the Euphrates in the regions where the river Aratsani
(Arsanias, Muratsu) flows into it, lay Isuwa (in Akkadian, Ishua), the
most important country in this region. Further to the south, in the
valley of the river Tohmasu, from modern Gurun to a certain point
east of the Euphrates, lay Tegarama (21); the part of Tegarama on the
right bank was considered subject to the Hittite Empire. Maldia 
[47] (Ass. Melid, Melidu, Melidia; Urart. Melitia, modem Malatya) (22) was
considered a separate area. Somewhere to the west of this region
we should probably seek the country of Armatana. Several small
semi-independent areas, which played no great political role, were
situated to the south of Maldia on both sides of the Euphrates between the mouth of the Arsanias and the place where the Euphrates flows into the plain (23).  A little further south began the lands belonging directly to Mitanni. Until the 14th century B.C. the influence of Mitanni probably extended somewhat further to the north (24).
</p><p>
To the southwest of these countries, in the Cilician Taurus, was
located the important kingdom of Kizzuwadna (Cataonia), with its
capital Kummanni (the Cataonian Comana). After the collapse of
Mitanni, Kizzuwadna seems to have been enlarged by the Hittites
at the expense of Mitanni (25).  It is probable that all these tribes and
countries were Hurrian-speaking (as for Kizzuwadna, its population was Hurro-Luwian) (26). However the Hittite sources usually do not refer to all these tribal units and countries as the "country of the Hurrians" (probably for the reason that to them the "country
of the Hurrians" was a synonym for Mitanni) (27).  Characteristic is
the ending <i>-(u)wa, -ua</i> in the place names; we fmd it both in these
and especially in the more eastern areas. In all probability we should
regard it as the Hurrian suffix of the genitive case, <i>-we</i> (28).  Thus
Salua means "(land) of the men of Sala," Hemmuwa means "(land) 
of the (men of) Hemme," and Ishua may mean "(land) of those on
the other side (of the river)," cf. Urart. <i>isha-ne</i>  "on the other side " (29).
Of the few proper names that have come down from this region,
part are Hurrian and part are Luwian; we get the impression that
there was a gradual penetration of the Luwian element into the
valley of the Upper Euphrates (30) .
</p><p>
We know quite a few names of the countries which were situated to the east of the valley of the Upper Euphrates, but their location is uncertain. Apparently the most important of them were
Hemmuwa (Hemme) and Salua (Sala), already mentioned above
(we should also note that they were probably Hurrian by language), and also Mehri. The only important country of this region whose location is known precisely, is Alzi (in the texts it is also
called A1se, Alzia  (31),  and possibly Assa). Alzi was located to the north
of the sources of the Tigris, apparently in the valley of the Arsanias
to the east of Isuwa.
</p><p>
The Assyrian annals of the 13th century mention the country or
tribe (or, more likely, tribal league) of the Uruatri, or Uruatru. It
is to be localized in the region of Lake Van. It included countries
with names which correspond to some of the above-mentioned 
[48] tribal areas (Hemme, Salua). However, Melikisvili suggests that the
text refers to tribes which were but namesakes of those mentioned
above and that the league of the Uruatri was located not to the
west but to the east of Lake Van (32).  The question is <i>sub judice</i>.
</p><p>
The Assyrian sources name yet another important tribe in the
valley of the Upper Zab: the Uqumanians, or Qumanians, whose
center was the city Qumme (Urart. Qumenu), where the Thunder-
god Tessub-Teiseba was worshipped (33).  This tribe, as well as the
Uruatrian tribal leagues, must have been Urartian-speaking.
</p><p>
In the cuneiform sources several terms of a more general nature
are also often used: <i>Pabhi,   Haphi, and Nairi</i>. The term <i>pabhe</i> (in
the Urartian sources also <i>babanabe</i>) means simply "mountaineer"
in both Hurrian and Urartian, and cannot be definitely localized.
The term <i>Haphi</i> designates the inhabitants of all the mountain area
in the Armenian Taurus and the Kurdistan mountains from the
sources of the Tigris to the regions north of the Assyrian cities and
indefinitely on to the north (34).  The term Nairi designated the more
remote mountain areas, including at times the eastern part of the
Armenian Highlands and Transcaucasia, and at times all of the
mountain areas of both the Armenian Highlands and of modern Iranian Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. Nairi in a more narrow sense was
apparently the valley of the Bohtansu south of Lake Van.
</p><p>
We must picture the population of all of the above-mentioned
areas as being in the last stage of the pre-class society , not unlike
Homer's Greece, or even less developed. The Hittites negotiated
in these "countries" not with kings, but directly with tribal elders
or popular assemblies. The "kings" of these countries are first mentioned by the Assyrian annals at the end of the 13th century B.C., but even then we must suppose that in most cases the annals mean the tribal military chieftains. However, as we have seen, the social
and economic stratification even in the regions far removed from
the class civilization of Western Asia, such as Transcaucasia, had
already in the 2nd millennium B.C. advanced quite far, and it is
possible that in some places there had already been attempts on
the part of these chieftains to appropriate royal power. For the
sake of comparison we may introduce the case of another tribal
confederacy, that of the  <i>Kaska</i>: one of their chieftains, who in the
14th century B.C. had successfully seized several northern Hittite
strongholds, did, as the Hittite sources inform us, for the first time
assumed royal power among the  <i>Kaska</i> , at a time when individual
rule was as yet unknown to them (35).  Probably the ruler of Azzi-
Haiasa, who also was officially glorified as "king," had done the
same.
</p><p>
Be that as it may, the degree to which the societies of  [49] Transcaucasia and the Armenian Highlands had advanced toward the level of class civilization should not be underestimated. Thus we cannot assert that in the 14th-12nth centuries B.C. such a level of civilization had not yet been achieved anywhere in the Armenian Highlands.

26. A Very Cherry Christmas 17 Album Preview Teaser

It’s the most wonderful time of the year again, which can mean only one thing. It’s time to unveil the latest edition of our annual Christmas compilation, A Very Cherry Christmas, and, we can’t quite believe this, but we’re now up to Volume 17! We never imagined, when we released volume 1 back in 2005, that it would ever last this long but, thanks to all the wonderful bands who have contributed amazing festive songs over the years and all our supportive fans, we’re still releasing our little Christmas compilation eighteen years later!

This year’s volume has once again been expertly compiled by renowned Christmas music aficionado and Dandelion Radio DJ Gareth Jones. This musical Christmas stocking is crammed with twenty-five brilliant seasonal songs from superb acts from all over the world and we can’t wait to share it with you!

As usual, A Very Cherry Christmas is a very limited CD release of just 200 copies, available exclusively here on our Bandcamp page. Once they’ve gone, we won’t be pressing any more. 

Please note, there is NO DIGITAL DOWNLOAD of this album, nor is it available on streaming sites. The only way to get this compilation is to buy the physical CD (however, some of the individual artists may release their song on their own Bandcamp page or on streaming sites, as is their prerogative). But you can, however, hear a taster track, comprising short clips of all 25 songs on the album. 

Wishing you all a very cherry Christmas,
Rachael, Adam &amp;amp; Gareth xxx

only one thing. It’s time to unveil the latest edition of our annual Christmas compilation, A Very Cherry Christmas, and, we can’t quite believe this, but we’re now up to Volume 17! We never imagined, when we released volume 1 back in 2005, that it would ever last this long but, thanks to all the wonderful bands who have contributed amazing festive songs over the years and all our supportive fans, we’re still releasing our little Christmas compilation eighteen years later!\r\n\r\nThis year’s volume has once again been expertly compiled by renowned Christmas music aficionado and Dandelion Radio DJ Gareth Jones. This musical Christmas stocking is crammed with twenty-five brilliant seasonal songs from superb acts from all over the world and we can’t wait to share it with you!\r\n\r\nAs usual, A Very Cherry Christmas is a very limited CD release of just 200 copies, available exclusively here on our Bandcamp page. Once they’ve gone, we won’t be pressing any more. \r\n\r\nPlease note, there is NO DIGITAL DOWNLOAD of this album, nor is it available on streaming sites. The only way to get this compilation is to buy the physical CD (however, some of the individual artists may release their song on their own Bandcamp page or on streaming sites, as is their prerogative). But you can, however, hear a taster track, comprising short clips of all 25 songs on the album. \r\n\r\nWishing you all a very cherry Christmas,\r\nRachael, Adam & Gareth xxx","creditText":"Compiled, mastered and sequenced by Gareth Jones\r\nCover art by Bill Vine\r\nSleeve layout and CD duplication by Matt at Hi-Fi Copies","copyrightNotice":"All Rights Reserved","comment":[{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","url":"https://bandcamp.com/crewealex","image":"https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0022729291_50.jpg","additionalProperty":[{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"image_id","value":22729291}],"name":"crewealex"},"text":["Always an instant buy for this every year!

It’s time to unveil the latest edition of our annual Christmas compilation, A Very Cherry Christmas, and, we can’t quite believe this, but we’re now up to Volume 17! We never imagined, when we released volume 1 back in 2005, that it would ever last this long but, thanks to all the wonderful bands who have contributed amazing festive songs over the years and all our supportive fans, we’re still releasing our little Christmas compilation eighteen years later!\r\n\r\nThis year’s volume has once again been expertly compiled by renowned Christmas music aficionado and Dandelion Radio DJ Gareth Jones. This musical Christmas stocking is crammed with twenty-five brilliant seasonal songs from superb acts from all over the world and we can’t wait to share it with you!\r\n\r\nAs usual, A Very Cherry Christmas is a very limited CD release of just 200 copies, available exclusively here on our Bandcamp page. Once they’ve gone, we won’t be pressing any more. \r\n\r\nPlease note, there is NO DIGITAL DOWNLOAD of this album, nor is it available on streaming sites. The only way to get this compilation is to buy the physical CD (however, some of the individual artists may release their song on their own Bandcamp page or on streaming sites, as is their prerogative). But you can, however, hear a taster track, comprising short clips of all 25 songs on the album. \r\n\r\nWishing you all a very cherry Christmas,\r\nRachael, Adam &amp; Gareth xxx&quot;,&quot;credits&quot;:&quot;Compiled, mastered and sequenced by Gareth Jones\r\nCover art by Bill Vine\r\nSleeve layout and CD duplication by Matt at Hi-Fi Copies&quot;,&quot;auto_repriced&quot;:null,&quot;new_desc_format&quot;:1,&quot;band_id&quot;:720448459,&quot;selling_band_id&quot;:720448459,&quot;art_id&quot;:1687636076,&quot;download_desc_id&quot;:3124267299,&quot;release_date&quot;:&quot;17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 GMT&quot;,&quot;upc&quot;:null,&quot;purchase_url&quot;:null,&quot;purchase_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_track_id&quot;:3128500160,&quot;id&quot;:1157515979,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;album&quot;},&quot;preorder_count&quot;:null,&quot;hasAudio&quot;:true,&quot;art_id&quot;:1687636076,&quot;packages&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:410340151,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cherryaderecords.bandcamp.com/album/a-very-cherry-christmas-volume-17&quot;,&quot;url_for_app&quot;:&quot;https://cherryaderecords.bandcamp.com/album/a-very-cherry-christmas-volume-17&quot;,&quot;type_id&quot;:1,&quot;type_name&quot;:&quot;Compact Disc (CD)&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Very Cherry Christmas - Volume 17 (limited edition CD of 200 copies)&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;PLEASE NOTE: While it is standard Bandcamp policy to offer a digital download with every purchase, we regret the whole of this album is NOT available to download.

            <div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">It’s the most wonderful time of the year again, which can mean only one thing. It’s time to unveil the latest edition of our annual Christmas compilation, A Very Cherry Christmas, and, we can’t quite believe this, but we’re now up to Volume 17! We never imagined, when we released volume 1 back in 2005, that it would ever last this long but, thanks to all the wonderful bands who have contributed amazing festive songs over the years and all our supportive fans, we’re still releasing our little Christmas compilation eighteen years later!<br>
<br>
This year’s volume has once again been expertly compiled by renowned Christmas music aficionado and Dandelion Radio DJ Gareth Jones. This musical Christmas stocking is crammed with twenty-five brilliant seasonal songs from superb acts from all over the world and we can’t wait to share it with you!<br>
<br>
As usual, A Very Cherry Christmas is a very limited CD release of just 200 copies, available exclusively here on our Bandcamp page. Once they’ve gone, we won’t be pressing any more. <br>
<br>
Please note, there is NO DIGITAL DOWNLOAD of this album, nor is it available on streaming sites. The only way to get this compilation is to buy the physical CD (however, some of the individual artists may release their song on their own Bandcamp page or on streaming sites, as is their prerogative). But you can, however, hear a taster track, comprising short clips of all 25 songs on the album. <br>
<br>
Wishing you all a very cherry Christmas,<br>
Rachael, Adam &amp; Gareth xxx</div>

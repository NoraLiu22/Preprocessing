/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 473]]</font> To the early 
          astronomers the earth was the center of the visible universe, sun, moon, 
          planets and stars all alike revolving around it in more or less eccentric 
          and complex orbits, and all were naturally thought to exist as appendages 
          to our globe and for the sole use and enjoyment of man--&quot;the sun to 
          rule by day, the moon and the stars to rule by night.&quot; But when the 
          Copernican system became established, and it was found that our earth 
          was not specially distinguished from the other planets by any superiority 
          of size or position, it was seen that our pride of place must be given 
          up. And, later, when the discoveries of Newton and of the many brilliant 
          astronomers who succeeded him, together with the ever-widening knowledge 
          derived from the growing power and perfection of the telescope and of 
          improved astronomical instruments, showed us the utter insignificance 
          even of our sun and solar system among the countless hosts of stars 
          and the myriads of clusters and nebul&aelig;, we seemed to be driven 
          to the other extreme and to be forced to recognize the fact that this 
          vast, stupendous universe could have no special relation to ourselves 
          any more than to any other of the million suns and systems, many of 
          which were probably far grander and more important than ours, and perhaps 
          fitted to be the abode of more highly organized beings. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the last half century, and perhaps much longer, 
          popular writers have often dealt with the problem of the habitability 
          of the planets by intelligent beings, and the probability of other suns 
          being attended by other trains of planets similarly inhabited, and the 
          most diverse and even opposing views have been held as to the inferences 
          to be drawn from these supposed facts. Sir David Brewster held them 
          to be almost essential to an adequate conception of the power and wisdom 
          of the Deity, and in some way bound up with the doctrines of Christianity, 
          and this has been the view of many of the teachers of religion. On the 
          other hand, the tendency of all recent astronomical research has been 
          to give us wider views of the vastness, the variety and the marvelous 
          complexity of the stellar universe, and proportionally to reduce the 
          importance of our little speck of earth almost to the vanishing point, 
          and this has been made use of by the more aggressive among modern skeptics 
          to hold up religious creeds and dogmas to scorn and contempt. They point 
          out the irrationality and absurdity of supposing that the Creator of 
          all this unimaginable vastness of suns and systems, filling for all 
          we know endless space, should have any <i>special</i> interest in so 
          pitiful a creature as man, the degraded or imperfectly developed inhabitant 
          of one of the smaller planets attached to a second or third rate sun; 
          while that He should have selected this little world for the scene of 
          the tremendous and necessarily unique sacrifice of his Son in order 
          to save a portion of these &quot;miserable sinners&quot; from the natural consequences 
          of their sins, was, in their view, a crowning absurdity too incredible 
          to be believed by any rational being. And it must be confessed that 
          the theologians had no adequate reply to this rude attack; while many 
          of them have felt their position to be untenable, and have renounced 
          the idea of a special revelation and a supreme Saviour for the exclusive 
          benefit of so minute and insignificant a speck in the universe.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 474]]</font> But during 
          the last quarter of the past century the rapidly increasing body of 
          facts and observations leading to a more detailed and accurate knowledge 
          of stars and stellar systems have thrown a new and somewhat unexpected 
          light on this very interesting problem of our relation to the universe 
          of which we form a part; and altho these discoveries have, of course, 
          no bearing upon the special theological dogmas of the Christian, or 
          of any other religion, they do tend to show that our position in the 
          material universe is special and probably unique, and that it is such 
          as to lend support to the view, held by many great thinkers and writers 
          to-day, that the supreme end and purpose of this vast universe was the 
          production and development of the living soul in the perishable body 
          of man. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Agnostics and Materialists will no doubt object 
          that the want of all proportion between the means and the end condemns 
          this theory from its very foundation. But is there any such want of 
          proportion? Given infinite space and infinite time, and there can be 
          no such thing as want of proportion if the end to be reached were a 
          great and worthy one, and if the particular mode of attaining that end 
          were the best, or perhaps even the only possible one; and we may fairly 
          presume that it was so by the fact that it <i>has</i> been used and 
          <i>has</i> succeeded.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of man as a spiritual being with 
          all his intellectual powers and moral possibilities is certainly a great 
          end in itself, so great and so noble that if a universe of matter and 
          ether as large as that of which we have now obtained some definite knowledge 
          were required for the work, why should it not be used? Of course I am 
          taking the view of those who believe in some Intelligent Cause at the 
          back of this universe, some Creator or creators, Designer or designers. 
          For those who take the other view, that matter and ether, with all the 
          laws and forces without which they could not exist for a moment, are 
          in their essential nature eternal and self-existent, no such objection 
          is tenable. For the production of life and of man then becomes merely 
          a question of chance--of the right and exact combination of matter and 
          its complex forces occurring after an almost infinite number of combinations 
          that led to nothing. On this view the argument as to our unique position, 
          derived from the discoveries of the New Astronomy, is even more forcible, 
          tho hardly so satisfactory, because it also teaches us that if man is 
          a product of blind forces and unconscious laws acting upon non-living 
          matter, then, as he has been produced by physical law, so he will die 
          out by the continued operation of the same laws, against which there 
          is no appeal. These laws of nature have been finely described in the 
          late Grant Allen's striking philosophical poem, which he has entitled 
          &quot;Magdalen Towers,&quot; and which was written when he was an undergraduate 
          at Oxford:</p>
        <blockquote><font size="-1">&quot;They care not any whit for pain or pleasure,<br />
          That seems to us the sum and end of all,<br />
          Dumb force and barren number are their measure,<br />
          What shall be shall be, tho the great earth fall.<br />
          They take no heed of man or man's deserving,<br />
          Reck not what happy lives they make or mar,<br />
          Work out their fatal will unswerv'd, unswerving,<br />
          And know not that they are!&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the object of the present paper to set forth 
        the nature of the evidence bearing upon man's position in the universe 
        and to summarize the various lines of research that converge to render 
        it at least a thinkable and rational hypothesis. Altho most of the facts 
        and conclusions are well known separately, and have been set forth by 
        both scientific and popular writers, I am not aware that they have been 
        combined as I now attempt to combine them, or the conclusions drawn from 
        them which seem to me to be the obvious ones. 
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the Stars Infinite in Number?</i>--It has 
          often been suggested that the stars are infinite in number and that 
          the stellar universe is therefore infinite in extent; and if the preponderance 
          of evidence pointed in this direction our inquiry would be useless, 
          because as regards infinity there can be no difference of position. 
          In whatever part of it we may be situated that part can be no nearer 
          the center than any other part. Infinite space has been well defined 
          as a circle, or rather a sphere, whose center is everywhere and circumference 
          nowhere.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the telescope increased in efficiency <font color="990000">[[p. 
          475]]</font> through the labors of Dollond and Herschel it was found 
          that every increase of power and of light due to increased diameter 
          of object-glass or mirror greatly increased the number of visible stars, 
          and this increase went on with approximate equality of rate till the 
          largest modern telescopes were nearly reached. But latterly increased 
          size and power has revealed new stars in a smaller and smaller proportion, 
          indicating that we are approaching the outer limits of the starry system. 
          This conclusion is further enforced by the fact that the numerous dark 
          patches in the heavens where hardly any stars are visible, and those 
          seen are projected on intensely dark background, as in the &quot;coal-sacks&quot; 
          of the southern hemisphere and rifts and channels in the Milky Way itself, 
          continue to present the same features in telescopes of the very highest 
          powers as they do in those of very moderate size. This could not possibly 
          happen if stars were infinite in number, or even if they extended in 
          similar profusion into spaces very much greater than those to which 
          our telescopes can reach, because in that case these dark backgrounds 
          could be illuminated by the light of millions of stars so distant as 
          to be separately invisible, as in the case of the Milky Way itself. 
          The only other explanation would be that the star-system is penetrated 
          in several directions by perfectly straight tunnels of enormous length 
          compared with their diameter in which no stars exist, and this is considered 
          to be so improbable as to be unworthy of consideration. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same conclusion is reached by means of that 
          powerful engine of research, the photographic plate. When this is exposed 
          in the focus of a telescope for three hours a much greater number of 
          stars are revealed than any telescope can detect, but longer exposures 
          add less and less to the number, again indicating that the limit of 
          stars in that direction is nearly reached.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet again, the method of counting the stars of the 
          various astronomical magnitudes gives a similar result. At each lesser 
          magnitude the number of stars is about three times greater than that 
          of the next higher magnitude, and this rule applies with tolerable accuracy 
          down to those of the ninth magnitude. The total number of visible stars 
          from the first to the ninth magnitude is about 200,000. Now if this 
          rate of increase continued, the number down to the seventeenth magnitude, 
          the faintest visible in the best modern telescopes, would be about 1,400 
          millions. But both telescopic observation and photographic charts show 
          that there is nothing approaching this number, it being estimated that 
          the total number thus visible does not exceed 100 millions--again proving 
          that as our instruments reach further and further into space they find 
          a continuous diminution in the number of stars, thus indicating an approach 
          to the outer limits of the stellar universe.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But perhaps the most striking proof of the limited 
          extent of the universe of luminous stars is that dependent on the laws 
          of light. This has been long known to astronomers and it has been very 
          clearly and briefly stated by Professor Simon Newcomb, one of the profoundest 
          of mathematical astronomers. He tells us to imagine a series of concentric 
          spheres, each the same distance apart from the first, which includes 
          only the stars visible to the naked eye. The space between each pair 
          of these spheres will be in extent proportional to the squares of the 
          diameters of the sphere that limit it; and as the light we receive from 
          each star is inversely proportional to its distance from us, it follows 
          that if each region were equally strewn with stars of the same average 
          brightness then we should receive the same amount of light from each 
          region, the diminution of light from each star being exactly compensated 
          by the vastly greater numbers in each successively larger sphere. Hence 
          it follows that if these concentric spheres were infinite we should 
          receive an infinite amount of light from them, and even if we make an 
          ample allowance for stoppage of light by intervening dark bodies, or 
          by cosmic dust, or by imperfect transparency of the ether, we should 
          at least receive quite as much light from them as the sun gives us at 
          noonday. But the amount we actually receive is so immensely less than 
          this as to prove that the concentric spheres of stars beyond those visible 
          to the naked eye cannot be very numerous. For the total light of all 
          the stars is estimated to be not more than about one-fortieth of moon-light, 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 476]]</font> which is itself only about one 
          five hundred thousandth of sunlight. This proof of the limited extent 
          of the stellar universe is therefore a very forcible one, and taken 
          in connection with that afforded by telescopic research, as already 
          described, is altogether conclusive. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have next to consider the facts known as to the 
          distribution and arrangement of the stars, and the conclusions to be 
          drawn therefrom.
        </p><center>
          <p><br />
            <i>The Distribution of the Stars in Space</i>
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first great fact bearing upon this subject is 
          that a large number of stars are not &quot;fixed,&quot; as was universally believed 
          down to the eighteenth century, but that many of them, and probably 
          all, have proper motions of their own. These motions are very small 
          and can only be detected by observations continued for many years. The 
          most rapid motion yet observed is that of a small star of 6 &frac12; 
          magnitude in the constellation Ursa Major, which moves seven seconds 
          of arc per annum, while others move only this amount in a century, and 
          all but a few less than a second per annum. The proper motions of several 
          thousand stars have now been determined. These motions are in every 
          possible direction, but it has been recently discovered that considerable 
          groups of stars often move in the same direction and at the same rate. 
          The Pleiades exhibit this phenomenon, but much larger groups have the 
          same kind of motion, and this has led to the theory that in certain 
          parts of the heavens there is a star-drift in fixed directions. Our 
          sun is now known to have its own &quot;proper motion,&quot; the direction and 
          rate of which has been determined approximately. This will, of course, 
          produce an apparent movement in all the stars except those situated 
          exactly in the line of our motion, and the displacement thus caused 
          has to be allowed for in determining the true motion of the stars in 
          space. Should any of the stars be moving obliquely toward us we shall 
          only perceive that portion of the motion which is at right angles to 
          the direction of the star from us, but the beautiful method of determining 
          motion in the line of sight by means of the spectroscope has overcome 
          this difficulty, and by its means we now know the real motion of many 
          stars, both in direction and velocity, when we have been able to measure 
          their distance from us.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This measurement of distances of the stars is the 
          most difficult of all the instrumental determinations of modern astronomy, 
          both on account of the extreme remoteness of most of them, and because 
          owing to the motions of the stars themselves we have no fixed point 
          from which to determine changes of position.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people know that by means of a measured base-line 
          the distances of very remote and inaccessible objects can be determined 
          with considerable accuracy, depending upon the length of the base and 
          its careful measurement, and equally upon the extremely accurate measurement 
          of the angles taken at each extremity of the base. It is in this way 
          that the position of mountain peaks is determined, as well as the distances 
          across narrow seas, while all civilized countries have been trigonometrically 
          surveyed in this manner.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the stars the base line used is the 
          diameter of the earth's orbit, more than one hundred and eighty millions 
          of miles. Every six months we are at opposite ends of this base, and 
          if we had any absolutely fixed point in the heavens in the right position 
          from which to take our angles we could in this way determine the distance 
          of some of the stars. But as almost all the stars are moving at various 
          rates and in various directions, as our sun itself is moving, and as 
          the proper motions of the stars can only be determined in relation to 
          other stars, there is everywhere a complication of opposing motions 
          and nowhere the assured fixity we require for such delicate measurements. 
          But, notwithstanding all these difficulties, astronomers have by various 
          ingenious methods now measured the distances of a number of stars with 
          considerable precision, notwithstanding the failures of their predecessors 
          for nearly two centuries. The nearest of all the stars are so remote 
          that the distance between the earth and the sun as seen from the star 
          would subtend an angle of considerably less than one second of arc, 
          while most of those measured are so excessively distant that this angle 
          is often one-tenth of a second, or even considerably less. To understand 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 477]]</font> how small a quantity this is 
          and what a distance it implies, it may be stated that, viewed at a mile 
          distant, the small letter o in this page would subtend an angle of about 
          one-tenth of a second. From a star of an average distance from us, therefore, 
          the earth and sun, if they could be seen, would appear only as far apart 
          as the opposite sides of the letter o when a mile away from us. But 
          stars twice as far as these have been measured, it is believed, with 
          some degree of certainty and the distances of about sixty stars have 
          now been satisfactorily ascertained. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was long supposed that the brightest stars were 
          the nearest to us, but it is now known that there is little or no relation 
          between brightness or magnitude and distance. The nearest star yet measured 
          is indeed a very bright one in the southern hemisphere, Alpha Centauri; 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 478]]</font> but one almost as near, 61 Cygni, 
          is of the fifth magnitude only, and another still nearer in the constellation 
          Piscis Australis is of the seventh magnitude. Those stars of the first 
          magnitude which have had their distances measured have a parallax of 
          considerably less than one-tenth of a second, and are therefore among 
          the remoter stars. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The true relation, as was long suspected theoretically, 
          is between proper motion and distance, those which move fastest being 
          nearest to us. It is as if from a mountain top we observed ships at 
          sea from two or three miles to 40 or 50 miles distant, and kept a record 
          of their angular movements. All might be really moving at not very different 
          speeds--from five to perhaps fifteen or twenty miles an hour, yet while 
          some would appear to move rapidly, others would seem to be almost stationary, 
          and this would depend almost entirely on their distance from the observer. 
          So with the stars. All may have, and probably have, real motions which 
          do not differ <i>very</i> greatly in rapidity, but only in those which 
          are comparatively near us can we detect any motion at all. This theoretical 
          conclusion being confirmed by all the stars whose distances have been 
          measured, we have a most valuable and trustworthy means of ascertaining 
          their comparative distances from us, since those whose proper motions 
          are either exceedingly small or cannot be detected at all are certainly 
          very much further from us than those which have well marked and large 
          proper motions. It is by such indications that we are enabled to arrive 
          at some definite conclusions as to the real form and structure of the 
          stellar universe, as we will proceed to show.
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Galaxy, or &quot;Milky Way.&quot;</i>--By far the most 
          prominent feature in the starry heavens is that vast irregular nebulous 
          ring which in all ages has attracted the attention and excited the admiration 
          of observers. This great ring divides the whole heavens into two hemispheres, 
          making an angle of about 63&deg; with the equinoctial, so that portions 
          of it pass not far from the north and south poles. Its nebulosity is 
          now believed to be almost wholly due to the massing together of myriads 
          of minute stars, since each increase in the power of the telescope shows 
          more and more of these stars, while the best photographic plates show 
          them everywhere closely packed, but still with a luminous haze between 
          them indicating yet more stars beyond. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But besides these minute stars which give us the 
          cloudy or milky appearance, it is found that stars of all degrees of 
          brilliancy are more numerous in the milky way and in its vicinity than 
          elsewhere. The two poles of the Galaxy are the regions where stars are 
          scantiest. Each 15&deg; nearer to it they increase in numbers, at first 
          slowly, then more rapidly, till we reach its borders. The following 
          series of numbers give the average number of stars in a square of 15' 
          at each 15&deg; from the pole of the galaxy, as determined by Sir John 
          Herschel: 4-5-8-13-24-53. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later observations have fully confirmed this, while 
          it has been shown by the late Mr. Proctor that all stars down to the 
          tenth magnitude, more than 324,000, when carefully mapped, mark out 
          the Milky Way in all its details by their greater density. Later still 
          the Italian astronomer Schiaparelli, by using all the materials now 
          available, arrives at the same result, and Professor Simon Newcomb, 
          of Washington, after a close examination of his maps assures us that 
          the Milky Way can be fairly traced out by the region of maximum agglomeration 
          of stars.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These facts lead to the conclusion that the Galaxy 
          is a vast annular agglomeration of stars forming a great circle round 
          the heavens, altho in places very irregular, being split in two for 
          about one-third of its circumference and being besides full of irregular 
          dark streaks and patches, where the most powerful telescopes show very 
          few stars. So that, as Sir John Herschel says, we are irresistibly led 
          to the conclusion that in those regions &quot;we see fairly through the starry 
          stratum;&quot; and this is further shown by the fact that in these parts 
          &quot;the ground of the heavens seen between the stars is for the most part 
          perfectly dark, which would not be the case if multitudes of stars, 
          too minute to be individually discernible, existed beyond.&quot; This great 
          ring is, therefore, evidently not very much extended in the direction 
          of its own plane--that is, the ring is not flat or greatly compressed 
          (as is Saturn's <font color="990000">[[p. 479]]</font> ring, for example) 
          or we should nowhere see through it. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what is more important is that we must be situated 
          not <i>in</i> any part of it, as was once supposed, but at or near the 
          very central point in the plane of the ring--that is, nearly equally 
          distant from every part of it. This must be the case because from any 
          other position the ring would not appear to us so uniform as it does. 
          If we were much nearer to one side of it than to the other, the nearer 
          side would appear broader, the more remote side narrower, and these 
          two directions would show a decided difference in the numbers of the 
          visible stars. Sir John Herschel, indeed, thought, the southern portion 
          was nearer to us than the northern because of its greater <i>brightness</i>, 
          which, he says, is very striking and conveys strongly the<i> idea</i> 
          of greater proximity. But this may be deceptive, because the whole Milky 
          Way shows great irregularities and variations in brightness, and it 
          is a remarkable fact that the portions near the north and south poles 
          are<i> both</i> equally narrow, while the parts 90&deg; from them are 
          <i>both</i> very broad, rather suggesting equality of distance in all 
          directions. Nearness would be indicated by a widening out of stars of 
          all magnitudes, not necessarily by any general increase of brilliancy. 
          The facts, therefore, seem to show that we are about equally distant 
          from all parts of the Milky Way. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very important, however, is Sir John Herschel's 
          testimony to the close correspondence of the Galaxy as a whole to a 
          great circle. He tells us that, following the line of its greatest brightness, 
          it conforms as nearly as may be to that of a great circle inclined about 
          63&deg; to the equinoctial and cutting that circle in R. A. 6 h. 47 
          m., and 18 h. 47 m., while its poles are in R. A. 12 h. 47 m., N. Decl. 
          27&deg;, and R. A. 0 h. 47 m., S. Decl. 27&deg;. He therefore determines 
          it, <i>by the figures he gives</i>, to lie in an <i>exact</i> great 
          circle as seen from the earth, as nearly as so irregular an object can 
          be defined. But neither he nor any other astronomer so far as I am aware 
          makes any remark on the extraordinary nature of this fact, which proves 
          that we are placed <i>exactly</i> in the plane of the greatest density 
          of the ring. The fact of the Galaxy forming a great circle as seen from 
          the earth being so familiar no one seems to have thought it worth while 
          to ask why it is so. If we could look at such a fact from the outside, 
          as it were, we should certainly impute to it some causal connection 
          between our system and the Galaxy. But before speculating what this 
          relation may mean we must consider another point of equal importance 
          in our relation to the system of stars. 
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Star Cluster.</i>--It has long been observed 
          that the brighter stars seem scattered over the whole heavens with no 
          special abundance in or near the Milky Way, and this was thought to 
          be due to their being much nearer to us. It is now known, however, that 
          brightness is no indication of nearness, so that this fact has little 
          significance. But, as we have seen, we do possess a real test of nearness 
          in the amount of the proper motion of stars, and this leads us to a 
          very definite and most suggestive conclusion. For the stars which are 
          nearest to us, judged by this test, not only have no apparent relation 
          to the Milky Way, but are spread over <i>every</i> part of the heavens 
          with tolerable uniformity. The most recent examination of this class 
          of stars is by Professor Simon Newcomb, who states the result in the 
          following words: &quot;If we should blot out from the sky all the stars having 
          no proper motion large enough to be detected, we should find remaining 
          stars of all magnitudes, but they would be scattered almost uniformly 
          over the sky, and show no tendency toward the Milky Way.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Kapteyn, of Groningen, appears to have 
          been the first to draw the obvious conclusion from these facts that 
          these nearer stars, spread around us in <i>every</i> direction, constitute 
          a globular mass which he termed the &quot;solar cluster,&quot; nearly concentric 
          with the Milky Way, and that our sun is &quot;deeply immersed&quot; in this cluster.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other astronomers have adopted this view, which 
          seems to be almost indisputable if the facts are as stated. For if the 
          cluster were <i>not</i> globular its component stars would not appear 
          to be so uniformly spread over the <i>whole</i> heavens; and if our 
          sun were <i>not</i> situated at or near its center but much nearer to 
          one side of it than to the other, then we <font color="990000">[[p. 
          480]]</font> should inevitably find the stars of this type (those with 
          measurable proper motions) much more numerous in one direction than 
          in a direction exactly opposite. But altho there may be some irregularities 
          in their distribution, it has not been pointed out that there is any 
          such regular inequality as this, and if there is not, then we must be 
          situated very near to the center of this &quot;solar cluster.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results so far reached by astronomers as the 
          direct logical conclusion from the whole mass of facts accumulated by 
          means of those powerful instruments of research which have given us 
          the New Astronomy is that our sun is one of the central orbs of a globular 
          star-cluster, and that this star-cluster occupies a nearly central position 
          in the exact plane of the Milky Way. But I am not aware that any writer 
          has taken the next step, and, combining these two conclusions, has stated 
          definitely that our sun is thus shown to occupy a position very near 
          to, if not actually at, the center of the whole visible universe, and 
          therefore in all probability in the <i>center</i> of the <i>whole material 
          universe</i>.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This conclusion is no doubt a startling one, and 
          all kinds of objections will be made against its being accepted as a 
          proved fact. And yet I am not acquainted with any great inductive result 
          of modern science that has been arrived at so gradually, so legitimately, 
          by means of so vast a mass of precise measurement and observation and 
          by such wholly unprejudiced workers. It may not be proved with minute 
          accuracy as regards the actual mathematical center. That is of not the 
          least importance. But that it is substantially correct in the terms 
          I have stated there seems no good reason to doubt, and I therefore hold 
          it to be right and proper to have it so stated, and provisionally accepted, 
          until further accumulations of evidence may show to what extent it requires 
          modification.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This completes the first part of our inquiry, but 
          an equally important part remains to be considered--our position in 
          the Solar System itself as regards adaptability for organic life. Here, 
          too, I am not aware that the whole facts have been sufficiently considered. 
          Yet they are facts that indicate our position in this respect to be 
          in all probability as central and unique as is that of our sun in the 
          stellar universe.

            <i>The Earth as Adapted for Life</i>
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the many workers who have more or less seriously 
          discussed the question of the adaptability of other planets for the 
          development of organic life and of the higher forms of intellectual 
          beings, I have not met with any who have considered the problem in all 
          its bearings. They have usually been content to show that certain planets 
          <i>may possibly</i> be <i>now</i> in a condition to support life in 
          forms not very dissimilar from those upon our earth; but they have never 
          adequately considered the precedent question, Could such life have originated 
          and have been developed upon these planets? This is the real <i>crux</i> 
          of the problem, and I believe that a full consideration of the required 
          conditions will satisfy us that, so far as we can judge, no other planet 
          can fulfil them. Let us, therefore, consider what these conditions are.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earlier writers on this subject could give free 
          play to their imaginations and overcome difficulties of temperature, 
          moisture, etc., by supposing that in other worlds there might be other 
          elements which had different properties from any we possess, and which 
          might render life possible under conditions very unlike those which 
          are essential here. But the revelations of spectrum-analysis have shown 
          us the unity of the constitution of matter throughout the whole material 
          universe, so that not only are the planets of the solar system all composed 
          of the same elements, but that the furthest stars and remotest nebul&aelig; 
          alike consist of the very same elements with which we are so familiar, 
          while the same physical and chemical laws undoubtedly prevail. We may 
          be confident, therefore, that wherever organized life may have been 
          developed it must be built up out of the same fundamental elements as 
          here on earth.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essential features of the structure of organized 
          beings are continuous growth and repair of tissues, nutrition by the 
          absorption of dead or living matter from without and its transformation 
          into the various unstable compounds of <font color="990000">[[p. 481]]</font> 
          which their bodies are built up. For these purposes a double system 
          of circulation, gaseous and liquid, has to be constantly in operation, 
          and this is carried on by means of minute tubular or cellular vessels 
          which permeate every part of the body. These wonderfully complex and 
          exquisitely adjusted circulating systems are entirely dependent on the 
          continuous maintenance of a very narrow range of temperatures somewhere 
          between the extremes of the boiling and the freezing points of water, 
          but really within much narrower limits, since if the whole of the water 
          at any time became solidified all the higher forms of life would be 
          destroyed, while a temperature very much below the boiling point if 
          permanently maintained would be almost equally detrimental. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we consider that the temperature of space is 
          about -273 C., while that of the outer surface of the sun is about 9,000 
          C., we realize what a combination of favorable conditions must exist 
          to preserve on the surface of a planet a degree of heat which shall 
          never for any considerable time fall below 0&deg; C., or rise above, 
          say, 75&deg; C., and that these narrow limits must be <i>continuously 
          maintained</i> not for hundreds or thousands only, but for millions, 
          perhaps for <i>hundreds of millions of years</i>, if life is to be developed 
          there. It is the maintenance of this comparatively uniform surface temperature 
          for such enormous periods--during, in fact, the whole time covered by 
          the geological record--that most writers have overlooked as among the 
          necessary conditions for the development of the higher forms of life 
          on a planet; and this omission vitiates all their reasoning, since they 
          have to show not only that the requisite conditions of temperature <i>may</i> 
          exist now, but that there is even a probability that they have existed 
          or will exist for a sufficiently extended period to allow of the development 
          of a complex system of organic life comparable with our own. Let us, 
          then, enumerate the chief favorable conditions, which in their combination 
          appear to have rendered this development possible on our earth. These 
          are: 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) A distance from the sun such as to keep up the 
          temperature of the soil to the required amount, by sun-heat alone, and 
          to evaporate sufficient water to produce clouds, rain and a system of 
          river circulation.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) An atmosphere of sufficient extent and density 
          to allow of the production and circulation of aqueous vapor in the form 
          of clouds, mists and dews, and to serve also as an equalizer of sun 
          heat during day and night, winter and summer, and also between the tropical 
          and temperate zones. This amount of atmosphere is held to be largely 
          dependent upon the mass of a planet, and this one feature alone probably 
          renders Mars quite unsuitable, since its mass is less than one-eighth 
          that of the earth.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The very large proportion of the surface covered 
          by deep oceans, so that they surround and interpenetrate the land, and 
          by their tides and currents keep up a continuous circulation, and are 
          thus the chief agents in the essential equalization of temperatures. 
          This, again, is largely dependent on our possessing so large a satellite 
          capable of producing a regular but not excessive tidal action. The want 
          of such a satellite may alone render Venus quite unsuitable for the 
          development of high forms of life, even if other conditions were favorable, 
          which seems in the highest degree improbable.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) The enormous average depth of these oceans, 
          so that the bulk of water they contain is about thirteen times that 
          of the land which rises above their level. This indicates that they 
          are <i>permanent features of the earth's surface</i>, thus insuring 
          the maintenance of continuous land areas and of uniform temperatures 
          during the whole period of the development of life upon the earth. (The 
          evidence which demonstrates this permanence is set forth in my &quot;Island 
          Life,&quot; Chap. VI, and enforced by additional arguments in my &quot;Studies 
          Scientific and Social,&quot; Vol. I, Chap. 2.) It is extremely improbable 
          that this remarkable condition obtains in any other planet.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Lastly, one of the most peculiar and least generally 
          considered features of our earth, but one which is also essential to 
          the development and maintenance of the rich organic life it possesses, 
          is the uninterrupted supply of atmospheric dust, which is now known 
          to be necessary for the production of rain-clouds <font color="990000">[[p. 
          482]]</font> and beneficial rains and mists, and without which the whole 
          course of meteorological phenomena would be so changed as to endanger 
          the very existence of a large portion of the life upon the earth. How 
          and why this is so is fully explained in my &quot;Wonderful Century.&quot; Now, 
          the chief portion of this fine dust, distributed through the upper atmosphere 
          from the equator to the poles with wonderful uniformity, is derived 
          from those great terrestrial features which are often looked upon as 
          the least essential, and even as blots and blemishes on the fair face 
          of nature--deserts and volcanoes. Most persons no doubt think they could 
          both be very well spared, and that the earth would be greatly improved, 
          from a human point of view, if they were altogether abolished. Yet it 
          is almost a certainty that the consequences of doing so would be to 
          render the earth infinitely less enjoyable, and perhaps altogether uninhabitable 
          by man. We must therefore reckon a due proportion of deserts and active 
          volcanoes, with sufficiently constant winds to distribute the dust from 
          them, as among the permanent essentials of a globe fitted for the development 
          of intelligent life. This utility of deserts and volcanoes is, I think, 
          now stated for the first time. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if we consider that these five distinct conditions 
          or sets of conditions, many of them dependent on a delicate balance 
          of forces acting at the origin of our planet, appear to be absolutely 
          essential for the existence of high types of organic life, we shall 
          at once see how peculiar and unique is our place and condition within 
          the solar system, since we know with almost complete certainty that 
          they do <i>not</i> all co-exist in any of the other planets. And when 
          we consider further that, even if they do happen to exist now, that 
          would be nothing to the purpose unless we had reason to believe that 
          they had also existed, as with us, <i>in unbroken continuity</i> for 
          scores or perhaps hundreds of millions of years. All the evidence at 
          our command goes to assure us that our earth alone in the Solar System 
          has been from its very origin adapted to be the theater for the development 
          of organized and intelligent life. Our position within that system is 
          therefore as central and unique as that of our sun in the whole stellar 
          universe.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, it may be asked, even if it be conceded that 
          both by position, by size and by its combination of physical features 
          we really do stand alone in the solar system in our adaptation for the 
          development of intelligent life, in what way can the position of our 
          sun at or near the center of the stellar universe, as it certainly appears 
          to be, affect that adaptation? Why should not one of the suns on the 
          confines of the Milky Way or in any other part of it possess planets 
          as well adapted as we are to develop high forms of organic life?
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are questions which involve the most difficult 
          problems in mathematical physics, and only our greatest thinkers possessing 
          the highest mathematical and physical knowledge could be expected to 
          give any adequate answer to them. In the meantime I will briefly indicate 
          what seems to me to be the probable nature of the reply. Accepting the 
          proof astronomers have given us, that, so far from the material universe 
          of which our sun forms a part extending infinitely into space, we can 
          actually <i>see</i> beyond its outer boundaries and can even approximately 
          give a maximum limit to its magnitude, we are confronted with the problem 
          of how a limited universe of matter and ether with the motions and forces 
          which everywhere pervade it can conserve those forces at and near its 
          furthest limits. Is it, in fact, necessarily becoming dissipated into 
          outer space? Do any of its constituent suns, like those comets which 
          have hyperbolic or parabolic orbits, continually fly out beyond its 
          range and become lost to it forever? Comparing the stars of the Milky 
          Way to the molecules of a gas, must not a certain proportion of these 
          stars continually escape from the attractive powers of their neighbors 
          as a result of collisions or in other ways, and wandering into outer 
          space soon become dead and cold and lost forever to the universe? Will 
          not the whole of the outer margins of the stellar universe be therefore 
          unstable, always being liable to pass into regions where they would 
          be dissipated as we see comets dissipated before our eyes? If such results 
          are certain it will follow that the outer portions of the universe, 
          at all events, and for an unknown extent <font color="990000">[[p. 483]]</font> 
          inward, will be entirely unfitted to insure that <i>continuity of uniform 
          conditions</i> which is the first essential for the development of life. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is only a small portion of the problem. 
          A still more difficult question is, how will the ether behave near the 
          outer borders of the universe? Can gravitation maintain its influence 
          on the confines of a finite universe in the same degree as near its 
          center? If, as now generally believed, gravitation is really produced 
          by pressure of some kind, which must be equal in all directions, then 
          it is almost certain that at any considerable distance beyond the central 
          portion of the universe gravitation would vary in intensity in different 
          directions. Whether this variation could possibly be detected by means 
          of the motions of remote binary stars, or in any other way, it must 
          be left for mathematicians and astronomers to determine.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, leaving this question of variation of the force 
          of gravity as beyond our powers at present, we may give a little consideration 
          to those wonderful radiant forces, other than light and heat, the very 
          existence of some of which we have only recently discovered. Such are 
          electricity, magnetism, the R&ouml;ntgen rays, the Hertzian, the Goldstein, 
          the Becquerel rays and some others. That electrical forces bear an important 
          part in the development of living organisms there can be little doubt, 
          while the other forms of radiation here referred to, some of which produce 
          curious physiological effects, can hardly be supposed to have been wholly 
          without influence in the formation of the marvelous living machine, 
          the substance of which in its complexity both of structure and constituent 
          elements is a true microcosm--an epitome of matter and its forces. But 
          if all these radiant forces, or several of them, have combined in the 
          development of life, we may feel sure that they can only have done so 
          under conditions which limit their energy to that gentle and imperceptible 
          action which has caused them to remain so long hidden even from the 
          most inquisitive seekers of the past century. And it is at least a possible, 
          and I think not improbable, supposition that this imperceptibility and 
          continuity may exist only in the more central portions of the universe, 
          while in its outer regions less regularity may prevail; and while some 
          of these necessary radiant forces may be wanting, others may be too 
          abundant or be manifested in so irregular or excessive a manner as to 
          be antagonistic to the delicate and nicely balanced forces which are 
          essential to the orderly development of life.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning now for a moment to the consideration 
          of our position in the stellar universe, it will assume a somewhat different 
          aspect in view of the possibilities or probabilities just set forth. 
          We can hardly suppose any longer that <i>three</i> such remarkable coincidences 
          of position and consequent physical conditions should occur in the case 
          of the one planet on which organic life <i>has</i> been developed without 
          any causal connection with that development. The three startling facts--that 
          we <i>are</i> in the center of a cluster of suns, and that that cluster 
          <i>is </i>situated not only precisely in the <i>plane</i> of the Galaxy, 
          but also <i>centrally</i> in that plane, can hardly now be looked upon 
          as chance coincidences without any significance in relation to the culminating 
          fact that the planet so situated <i>has</i> developed humanity.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course the relation here pointed out <i>may</i> 
          be a true relation of cause and effect and yet have arisen as the result 
          of one in a thousand million chances occurring during almost infinite 
          time. But, on the other hand, those thinkers may be right who, holding 
          that the universe is a manifestation of Mind, and that the orderly development 
          of Living Souls supplies an adequate reason why such a universe should 
          have been called into existence, believe that we ourselves are its sole 
          and sufficient result, and that nowhere else than near the central position 
          in the universe which we occupy could that result have been attained.</p>

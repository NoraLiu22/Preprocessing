<p><cite class="party">Sir John Betjeman</cite> famously said in the 1970s, "Manchester produces what 
to me is the <em>Pickwick Papers</em>. That is to say <em>Coronation Street</em>." This comment 
revealed more than just enthusiasm. The roots of what we now call soap opera can 
be traced to the success of the 'partwork' novel in the 19th century, and this 
serialised form of fiction became the norm for radio drama in the early part of 
the 20th century, particularly in the United States. Because these early daily 
radio serials were aimed at a predominantly female audience, they were generally 
sponsored by household goods companies, detergents and soap being particularly 
prevalent. This sponsorship, attached to the serials' particular style of 
heightened emotion and melodrama, led to the label 'soap opera'. </p>
<p>The 'soap' designation stuck with the serials when they moved to television, 
and their content and characteristics remained remarkably similar over the 
decades in the US. In the UK however, the public service ethos of both <cite class="party">BBC</cite> and 
<cite class="party">ITV</cite> ensured that soap opera had to evolve quickly, and the genre was rarely far 
from arguments about quality in broadcasting.</p>
<p>Although the <cite class="party">BBC</cite> made forays into continuing drama serials on radio, with 
<em>Mrs Dale's Diary</em> (1948-69) and <em>The Archers</em> (1950-), and, later, on 
television with <cite>The Grove Family</cite> (BBC, 1954-57), it was only when <cite class="party">ATV</cite> launched 
<cite>Emergency - Ward 10</cite> (ITV, 1957-67) that British television had its first soap as 
we would recognise it today. <cite>EW10</cite>'s success was such that it immediately became 
an open-ended, year-round serial, and the production team therefore had to 
engineer an ongoing sequence of intertwined plots, sub-plots and cliffhangers 
which allowed frequent story resolutions alongside newly-hatched storylines. 
</p>
<p>Old characters were written out, often by marriage or a trip away; killing 
them off was less common, as this would rule out another frequent occurrence: 
the unexpected return of an old character. The open-ended nature of the 
narrative also allowed the audience to identify with characters more strongly, 
as, in effect, the characters developed and aged alongside the audience. This 
was not something a standard drama series with a finite number of episodes every 
year could achieve. The result of this success and the audiences' fascination 
with the characters made the lead actors some of British television's first 
superstars, and this level of celebrity for soap stars has only become more 
exaggerated over the years.</p>
<p>The <cite class="party">BBC</cite> was unsure how to respond to <cite>EW10</cite> (or indeed to commercial television 
in general), but it eventually produced <cite>Compact</cite> (BBC, 1962-65), which, like 
<cite>EW10</cite>, was a rather stilted, middle-class affair set in a workplace. This 
immediately put it at a disadvantage, because ITV's newest continuing drama had 
already changed viewer expectations. <cite>Coronation Street</cite> (ITV, 1960-) was the 
creation of <cite class="party">Tony Warren</cite>, an actor-turned-writer who wanted to bring his vision 
of the North to the screen without compromise, and in doing so changed British 
soap opera forever. </p>
<p>Realism became the watchword for 'quality' British soap, and this focus on 
authenticity became such a powerful yardstick that eventually <cite>Coronation Street</cite> 
would itself be condemned as unrealistic; in the 1980s <cite>Brookside</cite> (Channel 4, 
1982-2003) and <cite>EastEnders</cite> (BBC, 1985-) would take up the tradition of realism by 
explicitly addressing the breakdown of the kind of community that had featured 
unchanged in <cite>Coronation Street</cite> for the previous 20 years. As well as the 
purported realism, all of these shows aspired to, and often genuinely attained, 
a quality that was missing from the more generic daily soaps: noted writers such 
as <cite class="party">Jack Rosenthal</cite>, <cite class="party">Jim Allen</cite>, 
<cite class="party">Tony Jordan</cite> and <cite class="party">Jimmy McGovern</cite> were allowed a 
certain freedom; characters were more consistently drawn; and (initially at 
least) storylines were low-key and believable. </p>
<p>Because of their perceived qualities, these shows avoided the broadcasting 
authorities' general concern that, unless monitored carefully, soap opera would 
drag television down to the lowest common denominator. But <cite>Crossroads</cite> (ITV, 
1964-89) was a different matter. The brainchild of <cite class="party">Reg Watson</cite> and <cite class="party">Lew Grade</cite>, 
<cite>Crossroads</cite> was the closest thing the UK had to the daily serials of the US, and 
it was enormously popular. The <cite class="party">Independent Television Authority</cite> and its 
regulatory successor, the <cite class="party">Independent Broadcasting Authority</cite>, were unimpressed, 
and twice punished the show, eventually reducing it from five weekly episodes to 
three. Other shows such as <cite>Weavers Green</cite> (ITV, 1966) were similarly frowned upon 
and swiftly vanished. The reaction to <cite>Crossroads</cite> demonstrates that in British 
television at the time, success was not the only criteria even in commercial 
television, and that lowly soap operas were still expected to achieve a certain 
standard. </p>
<p>In the 1970s and 80s, serials such as <cite>Coronation Street</cite>, <cite>EastEnders</cite> and 
<cite>Brookside</cite> were seen as the 'least worst' soap operas in the world. Also, despite 
fears to the contrary, the introduction of daytime broadcasting in 1972 led to 
the creation of quality continuing dramas such as <cite>General Hospital</cite> (ITV, 
1972-79) and <cite>Emmerdale Farm/Emmerdale</cite> (ITV, 1972-); both of these made the 
transition into peak-time schedules. Other daytime shows that went on to have 
long-term success included <cite>Pobol Y Cwm</cite> (BBC/S4C, 1974-) and <cite>Take the High Road</cite> 
(ITV, 1980-2003), but Australian imports such as <cite>The Young Doctors</cite> (1976-83) and 
<cite>Sons and Daughters</cite> (1982-87) also made an impression. Although the latter were 
very different to the glossy and popular US imports of the time such as <cite>Dallas</cite> 
(1978-91), <cite>Dynasty</cite> (1981-89) and <cite>Falcon Crest</cite> (1981-90), they were similarly 
derided for featuring overripe performances, preposterous cliffhangers and 
unbelievable storylines - all characteristics that were held up as a contrast to 
quality homegrown serials.</p>
<p>The US series were vastly popular but arguably the greater lasting impact on 
British soap opera came from Australia. <cite>Neighbours</cite> (1985-), a <cite>Reg Watson</cite> 
production, was initially shown on weekday lunchtimes, but a daily tea-time 
repeat drew huge ratings, and for a time <cite>Neighbours</cite> dominated the media, 
probably reaching its apogee with the wedding of Scott Robinson (<cite class="party">Jason Donovan</cite>) 
and Charlene Mitchell (<cite class="party">Kylie Minogue</cite>). <cite class="party">ITV</cite> responded by importing the Australian 
rival <cite>Home and Away</cite> (1988-) and the result was an early-evening schedule full of 
cheap and cheerful daily serials. The audience for these shows had a younger 
demographic, and gradually the traditional soaps began to try and appeal to the 
same audience; a trend which eventually resulted in a new soap, <cite>Hollyoaks</cite> 
(Channel 4, 1995-), aimed directly at teenagers. More importantly, the 
broadcasting authorities were no longer in a position to intervene on issues of 
quality, and the television companies were slowly able to increase the number of 
serials until continuing drama became the dominant form on British television.</p>
<p>In the past the question of quality had plagued the <cite class="party">BBC</cite>, and the corporation 
struggled to develop a successful soap opera partly because it was never quite 
sure if it wanted to be associated with a genre so heavily identified with 
commercial television. Nonetheless, it had a reasonable success with The 
Newcomers (BBC, 1965-69), the story of a family relocating from London to the 
country, but after the misfire of <cite>The Doctors</cite> (BBC, 1969-71) the <cite class="party">BBC</cite> abandoned 
attempts at continuing drama for a number of years until, following a scheduling 
experiment with <cite>Angels</cite> (BBC, 1975-83), it eventually struck gold with 
<cite>EastEnders</cite>. This success gave a vital boost to the <cite class="party">BBC</cite>'s audience share, and 
with a newfound enthusiasm for continuing drama, the corporation decided to 
launch a new soap which, if successful, would dominate the ratings on alternate 
nights to <cite>EastEnders</cite>.</p>
<p>The omens for a new show were not good. Granada had made a similar attempt 
when it launched <cite>Albion Market</cite> (ITV, 1985-86) specifically to capture audiences 
on Friday and Sunday nights as a complement to <cite>Coronation Street</cite>, but the show 
managed just 100 episodes before folding. The BBC's own folly, <cite>Eldorado</cite> 
(BBC, 1992-93), about British expats in Spain, fared no better and was widely 
perceived as an expensive disaster (<cite>Eldorado</cite> is now a fixture in 'worst TV ever' 
lists). </p>
<p>Both channels therefore, had little appetite to try and create another 
peak-time serial, and so began the process of increasing the number of weekly 
episodes for their existing shows, eventually reaching five episodes a week of 
Emmerdale and Coronation Street, and four episodes of <cite>EastEnders</cite>. This expansion 
has resulted in significant changes to production processes to the point where 
(ironically) all three major soaps are made in a way that would immediately be 
recognisable to the <cite>Crossroads</cite> production team of the 1970s. Many have argued 
more episodes has meant lower standards, and a breaking down of the distinction 
between the quality soaps and the traditional daily soaps.</p>
<p>However, soap opera was still a powerful influence on other genres. 
Partly this was due to personnel: writers <cite class="party">Jimmy McGovern</cite>, <cite class="party">Paul Abbott</cite> 
and <cite class="party">Kay Mellor</cite> all worked long apprenticeships on soaps, and their series such as 
<cite>Cracker</cite> (ITV, 1993-96; 2006), <cite>Band of Gold</cite> (ITV, 1995-97) and <cite>Clocking Off</cite> (BBC, 
2000-03) demonstrate this: all were realistic, socially engaged, agenda-driven 
and at least partly serial in form. Meanwhile, the production processes 
and formats of soap began to infiltrate other drama: <cite>The Bill</cite> (ITV, 1984-2010) 
became a continuous twice-weekly, thirty-minute series for a considerable time, 
and <cite>Casualty</cite> (BBC, 1986-) and <cite>Holby City</cite> (BBC, 1999-) effectively became 
open-ended, year-round shows. Even documentaries were not immune. 
Shows such as <cite>The Living Soap</cite> (BBC, 1993), <cite>Airport</cite> (BBC, 1996-2005) and <cite>Driving 
School</cite> (BBC, 1997) embraced soap characteristics to such an extent that a new 
genre, '<cite class="party">docusoap</cite>', was born.</p>
<p>The popularity and relative cheapness of <cite class="party">docusoap</cite> and other '<cite class="party">reality 
television</cite>' forms has undoubtedly had an impact on soap audiences, as those 
formats tend to display heightened emotion and exaggerated characters in a way 
that might not even be credible in drama. However, although individual 
serials have had their ups and downs over the years, soap opera itself remains 
the dominant force in television drama. The increasingly varied audience 
watch the serials in a more knowing way; viewers slip easily between character 
names and actor names, and although extensive coverage in magazines and the 
media generally means plots are known long in advance, the pleasure comes from 
finally seeing how the events unfold, and, more importantly, recounting the 
story to workmates and fellow viewers after the programme has finished. </p>
<p>But despite these changes, a powerful characteristic of the long-running soap 
opera remains - as the programmes grow old, so we grow old. A subtle reference 
to a past event can trigger a rush of memories, just as the death of a 
long-running character can lead to consideration of your own mortality. This 
unique aspect of the open-ended form continues to fascinate huge proportions of 
the public, and the effect shows no signs of diminishing.</p>

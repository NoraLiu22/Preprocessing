        From David Bohm and F. David Peat <br>
        <i>Science, Order, and Creativity<br>
        </i>New York: Bantam, 1987 </p>
      <p> In this section it is proposed that a form of free dialogue may well 
        be one of the most effective ways of investigating the crisis which faces 
        society, and indeed the whole of human nature and consciousness today. 
        Moreover, it may turn out that such a form of free exchange of ideas and 
        information is of fundamental relevance for transforming culture and freeing 
        it of destructive misinformation, so that creativity can be liberated. 
        However, it must be stressed that what follows is not given in the spirit 
        of a prescription that society is supposed to follow. Rather it is an 
        invitation to the reader to begin to investigate and explore in the spirit 
        of free play of ideas and without the restriction of the absolute necessity 
        of any final goal or aim. For once necessity and absolute requirements 
        or directions enter into the spirit of this exploration, then creativity 
        is limited and all the problems that have plagued human civilization will 
        surface yet again to overwhelm the investigation. </p>
      <p> To begin, it should be noted that many of the ideas to be explored were 
        first investigated by Patrick de Mar&eacute;, who is a psychiatrist working 
        in England. De Mar&eacute; has used his wide experience of dialogue in 
        therapeutic groups to support his arguments. However, it is essential 
        to emphasize that his ideas about dialogue are not concerned primarily 
        with psychotherapy, but rather with the transformation of culture, along 
        the general lines that have been indicated in this chapter. </p>
      <p> In the first two chapters it was shown how rigid conditioning of the 
        tacit infrastructure of scientific thought has led to a fragmentation 
        in science and to an essential breakdown in communication between areas 
        which are considered to be mutually irrelevant. Nevertheless a closer 
        investigation of actual cases suggested that there is nothing inherent 
        in science which makes such breaks in communication and fragmentation 
        inevitable. Indeed wherever fragmentation and failures in communication 
        arise, this clearly indicates that a kind of dialogue should be established. 
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The term <i>dialogue</i> is derived from a Greek word, with <i>dia</i> 
        meaning "through" and <i>logos</i> signifying "the word.&quot; Here "the 
        word" does not refer to mere sounds but to their meaning. So dialogue 
        can be considered as a free flow of meaning between people in communication, 
        in the sense of a stream that flows between banks. </p>
      <p> A key difference between a dialogue and an ordinary discussion is that, 
        within the latter, people usually hold relatively fixed positions and 
        argue in favor of their views as they try to convince others to change. 
        At best this may produce agreement or compromise, but it does not give 
        rise to anything creative. Moreover, whenever anything of fundamental 
        significance is involved, then positions tend to be rigidly nonnegotiable 
        and talk degenerates either into a confrontation in which there is no 
        solution, or into a polite avoidance of the issues. Both these outcomes 
        are extremely harmful, for they prevent the free play of thought in communication 
        and therefore impede creativity. </p>
      <p> In dialogue, however, a person may prefer a certain position but does 
        not hold to it nonnegotiably. He or she is ready to listen to others with 
        sufficient sympathy and interest to understand the meaning of the other's 
        position properly and is also ready to change his or her own point of 
        view if there is good reason to do so. Clearly a spirit of goodwill or 
        friendship is necessary for this to take place. It is not compatible with 
        a spirit that is competitive, contentious, or aggressive. In the case 
        of Einstein and Bohr, which was discussed in Chapter 2, these requirements 
        were evidently met, at least initially. However, because each felt that 
        a different notion of truth and reality was involved, which was not negotiable 
        in any way at all, a real dialogue could never take place. </p>
      <p> This brings us to an important root feature of science, which is also 
        present in dialogue: to be ready to acknowledge any fact and any point 
        of view as it actually is, whether one likes it or not. In many areas 
        of life, people are, on the contrary, disposed to collude in order to 
        avoid acknowledging facts and points of view that they find unpleasant 
        or unduly disturbing. Science is, however, at least in principle, dedicated 
        to seeing any fact as it is, and to being open to free communication with 
        regard not only to the fact itself, but also to the point of view from 
        which it is interpreted. Nevertheless, in practice, this is not often 
        achieved. What happens in many cases is that there is a blockage of communication. 
      </p>
      <p> For example, a person does not acknowledge the point of view of the 
        other as being a reasonable one to hold, although perhaps not correct. 
        Generally this failure arises when the other's point of view poses a serious 
        threat to all that a person holds dear and precious in life as a whole. 
      </p>
      <p> In dialogue it is necessary that people be able to face their disagreements 
        without confrontation and be willing to explore points of view to which 
        they do not personally subscribe. If they are able to engage in such a 
        dialogue without evasion or anger, they will find that no fixed position 
        is so important that it is worth holding at the expense of destroying 
        the dialogue itself. This tends to give rise to a unity in plurality of 
        the kind discussed in Chapter 3. This is, of course, quite different from 
        introducing a large number of compartmentalized positions that never dialogue 
        with each other. Rather, a plurality of points of view corresponds to 
        the earlier suggestion that science and society should consist not of 
        monolithic structures but rather of a dynamic unity within plurality. 
      </p>
      <p> One of the major barriers to this sort of dialogue is the rigidity in 
        the tacit infrastructure of the individual and society, which has been 
        discussed throughout this book. The tacit infrastructure of society at 
        large is contained in what is generally called culture. Within each society, 
        however, there are many subcultures which are all somewhat different, 
        and which are either in conflict with each other, or more or less ignore 
        each other as having mutually irrelevant aims and values. Such subcultures, 
        along with the overall culture, are generally rigidly restricted by their 
        basic assumptions, most of which are tacit and not open to awareness and 
        attention. Creativity is therefore, at best, an occasional occurrence, 
        the results of which are quickly absorbed in a fairly mechanical way into 
        the general tacit infrastructure. </p>
      <p> At present, a truly creative dialogue, in the sense that has been indicated 
        here, is not at all common, even in science. </p>
      <p> Rather the struggle of each idea to dominate is commonly emphasized 
        in most activities in society. In this struggle, the success of a person's 
        point of view may have important consequences for status, prestige, social 
        position, and monetary reward. In such a conditioned exchange, the tacit 
        infrastructure, both individually and culturally, responds very actively 
        to block the free play that is needed for creativity. </p>
      <p> The importance of the principle of dialogue should now be clear. It 
        implies a very deep change in how the mind works. What is essential is 
        that each participant is, as it were, suspending his or her point of view, 
        while also holding other points of view in a suspended form and giving 
        full attention to what they mean. In doing this, each participant has 
        also to suspend the corresponding activity, not only of his or her own 
        tacit infrastructure of ideas, but also of those of the others who are 
        participating in the dialogue. Such a thoroughgoing suspension of tacit 
        individual and cultural infrastructures, in the context of full attention 
        to their contents, frees the mind to move in quite new ways. The tendency 
        toward false play that is characteristic of the rigid infrastructures 
        begins to die away. The mind is then able to respond to creative new perceptions 
        going beyond the particular points of view that have been suspended. </p>
      <p> In this way, something can happen in the dialogue that is analogous 
        to the dissolution of barriers in the "stream" of the generative order 
        that was discussed at the end of the previous chapters. In the dialogue, 
        these blockages, in the form of rigid but largely tacit cultural assumptions, 
        can be brought out and examined by all who take part. Because each person 
        will generally have a different individual background, and will perhaps 
        come from a different subculture, assumptions that are part of a given 
        participant's "unconscious" infrastructure may be quite obvious to another 
        participant, who has no resistance to seeing them. In this way the participants 
        can turn their attention more generally to becoming aware, as broadly 
        as possible, of the overall tacit infrastructure of rigid cultural and 
        subcultural assumptions and bringing it to light. As a result, it becomes 
        possible for the dialogue to begin to play a part that is analogous to 
        that played by the immune system of the body, in "recognizing" destructive 
        misinformation and in clearing it up. This clearly constitutes a very 
        important change in how the mind works. </p>
      <p> There is, however, another extremely important way in which the operation 
        of the mind can be transformed in such a dialogue. For when the rigid, 
        tacit infrastructure is loosened, the mind begins to move in a <i>new 
        order</i>. To see the nature of this order, consider first the order that 
        has traditionally characterized cultures. Essentially this involves a 
        strong fragmentation between individual consciousness--"what the individual 
        knows all together"--and social consciousness--"what the society knows 
        all together." </p>
      <p> For the individual, consciousness tends to emphasize subjectivity in 
        the sense of private aims, dreams, and aspirations that are shared to 
        some extent with family and close friends, as well as a general search 
        for personal pleasure and security. In society, however, consciousness 
        tends to emphasize a kind of objectivity with common aims and goals, and 
        there is an attempt to put conformity and the pursuit of the common welfare 
        in the first place. One of the principal conflicts in life arises therefore 
        in the attempt to bring these two fragments together harmoniously. For 
        example, as a person grows up, he (or she) may find that his individual 
        needs have little or no place in society. And in turn, as society begins 
        to act on the individual consciousness in false and destructive ways, 
        people become cynical. They begin to ignore the requirements of reality 
        and the general good in favor of their own interests and those of their 
        group. </p>
      <p> Within this generally fragmentary order of consciousness, the social 
        order of language is largely for the sake of communicating information. 
        This is aimed, ultimately, at producing results that are envisaged as 
        necessary, either to society or to the individual, or perhaps to both. 
        Meaning plays a secondary part in such usage, in the sense, for example, 
        that what are put first are the problems that are to be solved, while 
        meaning is arranged so as to facilitate the solution of these problems. 
        Of course, a society may try to find a common primary meaning in myths, 
        such as that of the invincibility of the nation or its glorious destiny. 
        But these lead to illusions, which are in the long run unsatisfactory, 
        as well as dangerous and destructive. The individual is thus generally 
        left with a desperate search for something that would give life real meaning. 
        But this can seldom be found either in the rather crude mechanical, uncaring 
        society, or in the isolated and consequently lonely life of the individual. 
        For if there is not common meaning to be shared, a person can be lonely 
        even in a crowd. </p>
      <p> What is especially relevant to this whole conflict is a proper understanding 
        of the nature of culture. It seems clear that in essence culture is meaning, 
        as shared in society. And here "meaning" is not only <i>significance</i> 
        but also <i>intention, purpose</i>, and <i>value</i>. It is clear, for 
        example, that art, literature, science, and other such activities of a 
        culture are all parts of the common heritage of <i>shared meaning</i>, 
        in the sense described above. Such cultural meaning is evidently not <i>primarily</i> 
        aimed at utility. Indeed, any society that restricts its knowledge merely 
        to information that it regards as useful would hardly be said to have 
        a culture, and within it, life would have very little meaning. Even in 
        our present society, culture, when considered in this way, appears to 
        have a rather small significance in comparison to other issues that are 
        taken to be of vital importance by many sectors of the population. </p>
      <p> The gulf between individual consciousness and social consciousness is 
        similar to a number of other gulfs that have already been described in 
        this book, for example, between descriptive and constitutive orders, between 
        simple regular orders of low degree and chaotic orders of infinite degree, 
        and, of course, between the timeless and time orders. But in all these 
        cases, broad and rich new areas for creativity can be found by going to 
        new orders that lie <i>between</i> such extremes. In the present case, 
        therefore, what is needed is to find a broad domain of creative orders 
        between the social and individual extremes. Dialogue therefore appears 
        to be a key to the exploration of these new orders. </p>
      <p> To see what is involved, note that as the above dialogue develops, not 
        only do specific social and cultural assumptions "loosen up," but also 
        much deeper and more general assumptions begin to be affected in a similar 
        way. Among these, one of the most important is the assumption that between 
        the individual consciousness and the social consciousness there is an 
        absolute gulf. This implies that the individual must adjust to fit into 
        the society, that society must be remade to suit the individual, or that 
        some combination of both approaches must be carried out. If, however, 
        the dialogue is sustained sufficiently, then all who participate will 
        sooner or later be able to see, in actual fact, how a creative movement 
        can take place in a new order between these extremes. This movement is 
        present both externally and publicly, as well as inwardly, where it can 
        be felt by all. As with alert attention to a flowing stream, the mind 
        can then go into an analogous order. In this order, attention is no longer 
        restricted to the two extreme forms of individual and social. Rather, 
        attention is transformed so that it, along with the whole generative order 
        of the mind, is in the rich creative domain "between" these two extremes. 
      </p>
      <p> The mind is then capable of new degrees of subtlety, moving from emphasis 
        on the whole group of participants to emphasis on individuals, as the 
        occasion demands. This is particularly significant for proper response 
        to the strong emotional reactions that will inevitably arise, even in 
        the friendliest group, whenever fundamental assumptions are disturbed. 
        Because the mind is no longer rigidly committed to the individual or to 
        the social extremes, the basic issues that arise in a disagreement between 
        participants are to a considerable extent "defused." For the assumptions 
        that are brought to the common attention are no longer implied to have 
        absolute necessity. And as a result, the "emotional charge" that is inevitably 
        associated with an assumption that is dear to one or more members of the 
        group can be reduced to more manageable proportions, so that violent "explosions" 
        are not likely to take place. Only a dialogue that can, at the same time, 
        meet the challenge both of uncovering the intellectual content of a rigidly 
        held basic assumption and of "defusing" the emotional charge that goes 
        with it will make possible the proper exploration of the new order of 
        mental operation that is being discussed here. </p>
      <p> It is possible to have such dialogues in all sorts of circumstances, 
        with many or just a few people involved. Indeed even an individual may 
        have a kind of internal dialogue with himself or herself. What is essential 
        here is the presence of the spirit of dialogue, which is, in short, the 
        ability to hold many points of view in suspension, along with a primary 
        interest in the creation of a common meaning. It is particularly important, 
        however, to explore the possibilities of dialogue in the context of a 
        group that is large enough to have within it a wide range of points of 
        view, and to sustain a strong flow of meaning. This latter can come about 
        because such- a dialogue is capable of having the powerful nonverbal effect 
        of consensus. In the ordinary situation, consensus can lead to collusion 
        and to playing false, but in a true dialogue there is the possibility 
        that a new form of consensual mind, which involves a rich creative order 
        between the individual and the social, may be a more powerful instrument 
        than is the individual mind. Such consensus does not involve the pressure 
        of authority or conformity, for it arises out of a spirit of friendship 
        dedicated to clarity and the ultimate perception of what is true. In this 
        way the tacit infrastructure of society and that of its subcultures are 
        not opposed, nor is there any attempt to alter them or to destroy them. 
        Rather, fixed and rigid frames dissolve in the creative free flow of dialogue 
        as a new kind of microculture emerges. </p>
      <p> People who have taken part in such a dialogue will be able to carry 
        its spirit beyond the particular group into all their activities and relationships 
        and ultimately into the general society. In this way, they can begin to 
        explore the possibility of extending the transformation of the mind that 
        has been discussed earlier to a broader sociocultural context. Such an 
        exploration would clearly be relevant for helping to bring about a creative 
        and harmonious order in the world. It should be clear by now that the 
        major barriers to such an order are not technical; rather they lie in 
        the rigid and fragmentary nature of our basic assumptions. These keep 
        us from changing in response to the actual situations and from being able 
        to move together from commonly shared meanings. </p>

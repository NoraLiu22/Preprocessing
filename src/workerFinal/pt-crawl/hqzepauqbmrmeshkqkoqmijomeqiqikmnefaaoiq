In California during the summer of 2003, a 66-year-old man was
bitten on the finger by a bat.  Five weeks later, the man went to the
emergency room.  He complained of chest pain and said that over the past
few weeks he had felt drowsy, weak and ill.  The man's condition continued
to get worse:  he became confused, disoriented and developed a fever and
breathing problems.  A week after he entered the hospital, the man was
dead.  Tissue samples sent to the laboratory were found to contain the
rabies virus carried by the silver-haired bat (<i>Lasionycteris
noctivagans</i>).<BR> <img src = "clear.gif" width=100 height="1">

border=0><tr><td> Human rabies is rare in the United States because people
who are exposed to rabies can get shots to prevent the disease.  Many
people in countries without adequate control of rabies, however, are at
risk for an infection.  The <a href =
"https://www.who.int/health-topics/rabies#tab=tab_1">World
Health Organization (WHO)</A> estimates that rabies kills 59,000
people each year and millions of people are treated for exposure to rabies.

<h2><a name = "what">What</A> is Rabies?</h2>

Rabies is a disease caused by a virus that attacks cells of the nervous
system.  A <a href =
"http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/virus.html">virus</A> is a small germ.  
Viruses can cause diseases such as the flu, chicken pox, smallpox, measles
and hepatitis.  A virus can enter a cell of the body and multiply.  The
infected cell may die and the virus can move on to infect other cells.
Once the rabies virus enters the body, it is picked up by peripheral
nerves and transported to the central nervous system (brain and spinal
cord).  The virus moves toward the brain at a rate of between 12 to 100
mm/day.  Within nerve cells, the virus multiplies and then spreads to
other parts of the body, including the salivary glands.</td></tr></table>

<td>
Rabies is spread through the saliva of an infected animal.  People and
other animals can get rabies if they are bitten or scratched by an
infected animal.  Bats and raccoons often carry rabies, but dogs, cats,
skunks, foxes, wolves and coyotes can also be infected.  The rabies virus
belongs to the family of Rhabdoviruses.  When seen with an electron
microscope, the rabies virus has a bullet-shaped appearance.</td>

<h2><a name = "symp">What</A> are the Symptoms of Rabies?</h2>

Symptoms of rabies usually start within two to eight weeks
after a person is bitten.  However, in rare cases, it may take more than a
year for symptoms to develop.<P>
<img src = "./gif/raccoon.jpg" align=right width="200" height="150" 
vspace=20 hspace=30>

The first signs of rabies may look similar to the flu:<P>

<center><font size = "+1">Fever --  Headache -- Nausea -- Depression -- 
Sore Throat -- Stiff Muscles 
-- Loss of Appetite</center></font><P>

Pain, itching or tingling at the site of the bite may also be present. <p>

These symptoms may be followed by more serious signs:<P>

<font size = "+1">
Anxiety -- Confusion -- Convulsions -- Hallucinations -- Insomnia<BR>
Paralysis --  Breathing Problems -- Coma</center></font><P>

<font color=red>Hydrophobia (fear of water)</font> is seen in 50-80% of
people infected with rabies. The fear of water develops because people
have trouble swallowing.

<img src = "./gif/hippocere.jpg" align=left width="290" height="242" 
vspace=20 hspace=30>

<P>

Some animals infected with rabies may become restless and aggressive.  
They might try to bite other animals or objects.  Other infected animals
may become shy and try to hide.<P>

Once rabies attacks the central nervous system, it causes encephalitis
(brain swelling).  Inflammation surrounding brain blood vessels is often
seen.  <a href = "nsdivide.html">Areas of the brain</A> frequently
targeted by the rabies virus are the hippocampus, limbic areas, medulla
and cerebellum.  If rabies goes untreated, it is almost always fatal and
<font color=red>there is no cure</font>.

<h2><a name = "prevent">How</A> Can Rabies Be Prevented?</h2>

<img src = "./gif/mountains.jpg" align=right width="166" height="250"

<ol><li><strong>Stay away from wild animals:</strong> if you go on hikes
in the woods, do not pet or feed any animals you meet.  Remember, bites
and scratches can transmit rabies.

<LI><strong>Stay away from stray animals:</strong> you do not know if
these animals have been vaccinated against rabies.

<LI><strong>Discourage pests that may carry rabies:</strong> cover your
trash cans and don't leave pet food outside for wild animals to get.

<LI><strong>Make sure your pets are vaccinated against rabies:</strong>
effective vaccines are available for dogs, cats, ferrets, horses, cattle
and sheep.  The number of cases of animal rabies in pets and domesticated
animals has been reduced since the 1950s when vaccination of these types
of animals started.  Rabies in wild animals is still high.

<LI><strong>Get yourself vaccinated:</strong> if you will be working or
traveling in an area where you may encounter rabid animals (e.g., a
veterinary office, wilderness, virus laboratory), you might consider
getting vaccinated.

<LI><strong>Call the animal control office:</strong> if you see an animal
behaving strangely. </ol><P>

Some countries are attempting to vaccinate wild animals using an oral
rabies vaccine.  Food with the vaccine is dropped from planes into the
wilderness.  Animals who eat this food get a snack and are protected
against rabies should they be exposed to the virus.

<h2><a name = "treat">How</A> is Rabies Treated?</h2>
<img src = "./gif/syringe.gif" align=right width="16" height="100" 
vspace=20 hspace=30>

If you are bitten by an animal:<P>

<ol> <LI><strong>First aid:</strong> immediately wash the bite or scratch
with soap and water.

<LI><strong>See a doctor:</strong> a series of injections given as soon as
possible after a bite is usually effective in preventing rabies.  The
first injection near the site of the bite contains antibodies that fight
the rabies virus before it can reach the central nervous system.  This
protection lasts only a few weeks.  A series of five injections given over
the next few weeks helps a person make his or her own antibodies against
the rabies virus.  This provides long-lasting protection against rabies.

<LI><strong>Have the animal quarantined (if possible):</strong> the animal
will be watched for 7-10 days to see if it develops signs of rabies.

<LI>Rabies has been found in every state of the US except for Hawaii.

<LI>Only mammals can get rabies.  Birds, fish, snakes and frogs do not get
rabies.

<LI>Rabies is NOT transmitted through contact with blood.

<LI>The word "rabies" comes from the Latin word meaning "to rage."

<LI>The word "hydrophobia" comes from the Greek words meaning "water" and
"fear."

<LI>Louis Pasteur and his research team developed the first successful
rabies vaccine. This vaccine was tested on Joseph Meister on July 6, 1885.  
Joseph was a 9-year-old boy who was bitten 14 times by a rabid dog.  Dr.
Pasteur gave Joseph a shot that prevented rabies.

<LI>In the United States in 2004, there were 6,836 cases of rabies in
nonhuman animals and 8 cases in human beings reported to the to the CDC.
Rabies was found most often in raccoons (2,564 cases), skunks (1,856
cases) and bats (1,361 cases).  (Reference: Krebs, J.W., Mandel, E.J.,
Swerdlow, D.L. and Rupprecht, C.E., <I>JAVMA,</i> 227:1912-1925, 2005)

<LI>Eight people have died after receiving corneal transplants from people
infected with the rabies virus.  The risk of such human-to-human
infections is very low because of improved screening of organ donations.

<LI>A bat bite often goes undetected because bat teeth can be small and
the wound may not be large.

<LI>Neuroscientists use the rabies virus in an experimental method to
trace neuronal pathways in the brain.

<LI>Approximately $300 million is spent each year in the United States to
prevent rabies.  Most of this money is spent on vaccinating dogs.

<LI>Rabies is discussed in the book <i>Old Yeller</i> by Fred Gipson. The
dog, Old Yeller, protects a family from a rabid wolf.  Unfortunately, Old 
Yeller is bitten by the wolf.  The family decides it is better to kill Old
Yeller rather than take the chance that the dog will develop rabies.

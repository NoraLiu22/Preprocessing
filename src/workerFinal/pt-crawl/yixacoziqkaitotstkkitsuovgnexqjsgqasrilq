<p>Notes and Comments</p>

<p>Provisional version by Neil Parsons April 1999</p>

<p>Scientific research in Botswana has characteristically been
concerned with natural history (notably biology) and features of
economic value (notably geology), as well as with environmental
questions. For the latter also see <a href="bhp7.htm">Page 7:
Geography</a>.</p>

<h2>BOTANY</h2>

<p>The Kalahari, i.e. the <b>sandveld</b> west of the hardveld and
south of the ancient lake beds, has often been called 'thirstland'
to distinguish it from true desert. Even in its south-western
corner, where there are some bare sand dunes, the vegetation is
more characteristic of dry steppe than desert.</p>

<p>The general vegetation of the country is savanna (grassland)
with yellow or light brown grass cover (turning green after rains)
and woody plants. The savanna ranges from Acacia shrub savanna in
the south-west through acacia thorn bush and tree savanna
'parkland' into denser woodland and eventually forest as one moves
north and east.</p>

<p>Tree savanna on rocky hills of the eastern <b>hardveld</b>
merges northwards into Mopane (African ironwood) woodland. Mopane
woodland covers much of the northern and eastern third of the
country, with the exception of the open grasslands immediately
surrounding the Okavango delta and Makgadikgadi pans.</p>

<p>Plant life in the acacia shrub savanna includes <i>tsamma</i>
melons, an invaluable source of liquid for humans and animals in
the thirstland. Typical woody plants in bush savanna are <i>
mongana</i> (blackthorn acacia), <i>mhahu</i> (Acacia fleckii), <i>
setshi</i> (candlepod acacia), <i>moselesele</i> (Kalahari
christmas-tree) and morukuru (tamboti); while mogononono (silver
terminalia) and <i>moretlwa</i> (wildraisin bush) are also found in
acacia tree savanna. Cacti, aloes and prickly pears
(<i>motoroko</i>), and a few species of evergreen tree are found on
rocky hills.</p>

<p>Mopane woodland includes, besides mopane and acacia, the
spectacular <i>mowana</i> or baobab ('upside-down tree') which may
live up to four thousand years, and <i>morula</i> (wild plum).</p>

<p>Isolated stands of palm trees (<i>mokolane</i>) grow on aquatic
grassland in the north, while tall trees such as <i>mzungula</i>
(sausage tree), <i>mokotshong</i> (African ebony) and varieties of
acacia grow along river banks. The dry deciduous forest of the
extreme north-east consists of <i>mukw</i>a (bloodwood) and <i>
mukusi</i> (Zimbabwean teak), which are commercially exploited for
timber.</p>

<h2>ZOOLOGY (WILDLIFE)</h2>

<p>Animal life is extremely varied in a thirstland environment.
About 150 species of mammal are found in Botswana. These range from
30 species of bats and 27 of rodents to over 30 species of large
mammal. Many large and small antelope, and scavengers such as
jackals and hyaenas, can be found across the savanna, though rarely
near centres of population or main roads.</p>

<p>Very large mammals such as giraffe, elephant, rhino, buffalo and
lion are generally confined to the secure wild life areas,
including parks and reserves, which cover about a fifth of the
country; hippo and crocodile being found in the rivers and marshes
of the north.</p>

<p>Botswana suffers less poaching than countries to the north, and
there are active wildlife conservation groups. See <a href=
"http://www.udel.edu/IntlProg/africa/research.html">Kalahari
Conservation Society</a> and others on <a href="bhp14.htm">Page 14:
Tourism</a>.</p>

<p><a href=
"http://www.gorp.com/gorp/location/africa/botswana/birding.htm">
Bird life</a> is prolific, with more than 460 species including
ostrich and bustard on the plains, cormorant and herons in aquatic
areas, vulture and eagle or kite near hills, and woodland species
such as goshawk and warbler. Small grassland species have spread to
agricultural areas carved out of the woodlands, notably the <i>
quelea</i> finch which flocks in hundreds of thousands and attacks
grain fields.</p>

<p>Botswana has a great variety of reptiles and amphibians, of
which over 200 species have been described in detail.</p>

<p>The principal fish, in the rivers of the north, are <i>
tilapia</i> (African bream), catfish and the tiger fish famous for
its ferocious resistance to being caught on line.</p>

<p>Up to 80,000 insect species have been scientifically named and
described in southern Africa, but this may only constitute five per
cent of the total. A start in describing new Botswana species has
been made on beetles and grasshoppers, but moths and butterflies,
flies and mosquitoes, wasps and ants remain among the least
studied.</p>

<h2>GEOLOGY</h2>

<p>Geological exploration has been limited by the depth and extent
of Kalahari sand covering the surface geology.</p>

<p>The rock groups underlying most of the sandveld are therefore
least known, but appear to be the youngest-belonging to the Karoo
supergroup formed 135-290 million years ago. Elsewhere Precambrian
rock formations redominate.</p>

<p>The surface geology of the eastern hardveld, exposed in its hill
ranges, largely consists of Basement complex rocks (more than 2500
million years old) intruding from the Transvaal and southern
Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>This complex is known to extend into younger rock formations
(1200- 2500 million years old) in the extreme southern sandveld;
while rocks of the Ghanzi and Damara groups (570-1200 million years
old) extend across the north-west corner of the country into
neighbouring northern Namibia.</p>

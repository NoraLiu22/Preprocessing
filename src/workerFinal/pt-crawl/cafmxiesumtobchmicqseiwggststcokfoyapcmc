<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Sharland (1971)
published one of the few accounts of an actual "tiger" hunt (based on the
childhood recollections of Mr. W. J. Cotton) in his book <i>"A Pocketful
of Nature"</i>:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Taking two sheep
dogs we rode out, and as we neared the tiger's lair the dogs' hackles rose
and they snarled and whined as if in fear.&nbsp; Father lifted me up into
a tree, and a moment later the tiger broke cover, loping away ahead of
the dogs.&nbsp; The first shot brought him down, but he got to his feet
immediately and faced his snarling tormentors.&nbsp; I remember the tiger
was making a coughing, snuffling noise, and appeared to be all gaping mouth
and huge teeth as it snapped at the dogs.&nbsp; My father could not get
another shot for fear of hitting the dogs, which were rushing round and
round the tiger.&nbsp; His fused backbone made him turn very slow in comparison
to the dogs, and eventually one of them grabbed him by the throat.&nbsp;
The tiger reared up in the air, and then they crashed, rolling over and
over along the ground.&nbsp; When they came to a stop, the first dog had
been shaken off, and as the tiger rose to his feet, this dog grabbed him
on the other side of the throat.&nbsp; The two dogs hung on as the tiger
kept rearing in an effort to shake them off.&nbsp; Eventually, he made
a last desperate effort, and as he came down on his back with the dogs
still hanging at his throat the tiger let out the most unearthly scream
I have ever heard.&nbsp; Father walked up and pointed the gun at the tiger's
head, but he was quite dead.&nbsp; The pelt was taken home and pegged out,
and was measured at just over 7 foot from nose to tip of tail.&nbsp; My
father said that during the night the dogs barked and howled continuously,
and he went out four or five times to quieten them.&nbsp; However, when
he went out next morning one of them had broken away from his chain and
ripped the tiger skin to pieces".</font></i></td>

the tiger continued unabated into the early part of the 20th century as
can be seen from a story entitled <i>"A Hungry Tiger"</i> published in
the Examiner newspaper of the 4th May 1909 (p. 5):&nbsp;</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The district of
Montagu, which has been settled and civilised for a great many years, had
a visit from one of its primitive barbarians - a native tiger.&nbsp; That
animal had left traces of its presence in a few slaughtered and half eaten
sheep.&nbsp; Having killed one on Mr. Smith's farm on the night of April
29, he returned on the next day to the carcase.&nbsp; Mr. Smith's dogs,
however, disturbed him, and he took refuge in the orchard, where the dogs
kept him at bay.&nbsp; Some ladies were passing by on their way to the
polling booth, and, seeing the tiger, one of them ran home and told her
husband, who brought his gun and shot the animal.&nbsp; This capture was
a source of much satisfaction to Mr. Smith, and also to a neighbouring
farmer who had threatened to wait by the carcase all night for the purpose
of capturing the animal".</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Port Pirie Recorder
and North Western Mail (a South Australian newspaper) of the 17th November
1909 (p. 5) states:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And when you see
a party of mounted men, chasing at speed along the plains, or driving,
with zest and glee, into the recesses of the forests, headed by packs of
howling dogs, you know that they are settlers, intent on ridding the countryside
of this pest, the thylacine".</font></i></td>

A total of 2,207 bounties were paid at a total cost of &pound;2,132 and
ten shillings.&nbsp; The bounty legislation was repealed by the Tasmanian
Government on the 26th April 1909.&nbsp; The Van Diemen's Land Company
bounty was terminated some five years later in 1914.&nbsp; Even after the
cessation of the various bounty schemes, the thylacine continued to be
snared and shot, and it was not until the 10th July 1936 that the species
was afforded total protection under the law.</font>

Below<a NAME="Batty"></a> is a photograph of farmer Wilfred ("Wilf") Batty
with the thylacine he shot after seeing it kill poultry on his Mawbanna
property around noon on Tuesday, 6th May 1930.&nbsp; The thylacine (a male)
was killed with one shot to the shoulder and took around 20 minutes to
die.&nbsp; Batty has since acquired the notorious distinction of having
made the last documented thylacine kill.&nbsp; This photograph was taken
by Pat O'Halloran, a postal mechanic from Stanley.&nbsp; The following
day, the body was sold to the animal dealer

it to the Hobart Museum where it was prepared for taxidermy before being
sent on tour around Australia (Anon. 1980).&nbsp; The present location
of the taxidermy (if it still exists) is unknown.&nbsp; Note the dog's
fearful stance toward the thylacine; Batty commented that his dogs were
so terrified by the presence of the corpse that they did not go near the
house for three days afterwards.</font></font>

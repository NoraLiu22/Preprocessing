<a name="Heading3"></a><b>PROHIBITING THE CONSCRIPTION OF STATE OFFICERS FOR
COMMONWEALTH PURPOSES: AN AMERICAN FUTURE FOR THE STATE IMMUNITY
DOCTRINE?</b></h1>
<p align="center"><b><i>Matthew
Moorhead</i></b><sup><i><a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[*]</a></i></sup></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading6"></a><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
<p>In undertaking its responsibility to interpret and construct federalism, the
High Court of Australia has frequently considered the
Supreme Court of the
United States' treatment of the same
subject.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup> The US influence has been
particularly pronounced in the area of State
immunity.<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a></sup> This article considers
whether an American constitutional innovation of the 1990s, the
anti-commandeering doctrine articulated in
the case of <i>Printz v United
States</i>,<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a></sup> can and should be
transplanted to Australia.</p>
<p>'<i>Printz v United States</i> embodies the [Supreme] Court's most emphatic
acclamation of state sovereignty since the New
Deal';<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup> it is a 'watershed in the
jurisprudence of federalism.'<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup><i>
</i>In the lead judgment, written by Scalia J, the Supreme Court expounded a new
bright-line rule: </p>
<blockquote>
The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to
address particular problems, nor command the States'
officers, or those of their
political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory
program.<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>This rule,
the Supreme Court made clear, is categorical and permits no exceptions: </p>
<blockquote>
It matters not whether policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case weighing of
the burdens or benefits is necessary; such commands
are fundamentally
incompatible with our constitutional system of dual
sovereignty.<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>The
rule in <i>Printz</i> has been brought to the attention of the High Court.
Appearing in <i>Austin v
Commonwealth</i>,<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup><i> </i>the
Solicitor-General for South Australia, B M Selway QC, invoked
<i>Printz</i> and argued that a similar anti-commandeering rule was applicable
to the Australian constitutional context: </p>
<blockquote>
The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> establishes a dual system of government &#8230; The
Commonwealth cannot exercise its powers so as to control the States as
governmental
polities. It is necessarily inconsistent with the independence of
the States for the Commonwealth to have power unilaterally to direct
the State
or its employees to perform Commonwealth
duties.<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The joint
judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, noting South Australia's reference to
certain 'narrowly divided decisions of the
United States Supreme
Court'<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup> and citing <i>Printz</i>,
resolved <i>Austin</i> without deciding the issue. In doing so, the High Court
left open the intriguing prospect of an anti-commandeering doctrine tailored
to
Australian federalism: </p>
<blockquote>
In the end, the complaint here is that consistently with, and perhaps in
development of, the reasoning in <i>Australian Education Union</i>, it is
critical to the constitutional integrity of the States that they alone have the
capacity to give directions to their officials
and determine what duties they
perform. That is a large proposition and best left for another
day.<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The High
Court has an opportunity to consider the issue again, after hearing the appeals
of <i>O'Donoghue v Ireland </i>and <i>Zentai v Republic of Hungary </i>together
with the special leave application of <i>Williams v United
States</i>.<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></sup> The two appeals and
the application challenged the validity of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 19</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">46</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" class="autolink_findacts">Extradition
Act 1988</a></i> (Cth) ('<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" class="autolink_findacts">Extradition Act</a></i>'). At first instance in the case of
<i>Zentai v Republic of
Hungary</i>,<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup> having noted the
applicants' reliance on <i>Printz</i>, Siopis J dismissed the anti-commandeering
argument before noting that a commandeering situation did not, in fact, arise on
the facts.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup> The Full Court agreed
that the facts of the case did not support the appellants' anti-commandeering
argument.<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup> With regard to the
validity of such an argument generally, Tamberlin J (with whom Moore and Gyles
JJ agreed),<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup> was of the opinion
that:</p>
<blockquote>
This submission for the appellants raises difficult and complex questions of
constitutional law. However, it is not necessary for
the Court to determine
these issues in order to resolve the present dispute, and we will not do so. As
Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne
JJ said in <i>Austin</i>, the submission raises 'a
large proposition' that, in their Honours' view, was not necessary to determine
in that case and therefore
'best left for another
day'.<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup></blockquote><p>This
article attempts to conceptualise and critique this large proposition. The
question to be addressed is whether it is in fact
'critical to the
constitutional integrity of the States' that the Commonwealth be prohibited from
conscripting State officers for
federal functions. To phrase the question
negatively, in the words of Scalia J: are 'such commands &#8230; fundamentally
incompatible
with our constitutional
system?'<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part I</a> presents <i>Printz</i> and analyses the reasoning of the majority.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> searches the text of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> for a <i>Printz</i> rule
before considering whether, using the High Court's preferred manner of assessing
implications from the structure of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, a categorical
anti-commandeering rule is logically or practically necessary to preserve the
federal structure of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. It does so by evaluating whether a
bright-line anti-commandeering rule is necessary to prevent the impairment of
the States' capacity
to function as independent governments, or whether the
case-by-case approach in <i>Austin</i> is more appropriate in commandeering
cases. The presentation of the proposed anti-commandeering doctrine in both
<i>Austin</i> and <i>Zentai</i> is considered in more detail. In <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part III</a> it is
argued that the text and structure reasoning in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> cannot conclusively
resolve the question, and the normative arguments for adopting a <i>Printz</i>
rule are considered.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading38"></a><b>I	UNDERSTANDING THE ANTI-COMMANDEERING DOCTRINE AND
ITS AMERICAN CONTEXT</b></h2>
<h3>
<a name="Heading39"></a><b>A	</b><b><i>New York v United
States</i>:</b><sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup><b> Birth of the
anti-commandeering doctrine</b></h3>
<p>In 1992 the Supreme Court of the United States expounded a new
anti-commandeering doctrine: 'The Federal Government may not compel
the States
to enact or administer a federal regulatory
program.'<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup> For the first time
since 1976<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup> the Supreme Court
invalidated a federal law for violating the Tenth
Amendment.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>With O'Connor J writing for the majority, the Court held that Congress could
not 'commandeer' State legislative procedures by coercing
States to regulate any
particular field. The case concerned several provisions of the <i>Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of
1985</i>,<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup> which provided for the
participation of States in the disposal of nuclear waste. The so-called 'take
title' provisions 'offer[ed]
state governments a "choice" of either accepting
ownership of waste or regulating according to the instructions of
Congress.'<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup> The provision,
although 'well within Congress' authority under the Commerce
Clause',<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup> violated the Tenth
Amendment. Requiring States to accept one of two options, both of which required
an act of lawmaking by the State
&#8212; to accept ownership of radioactive
waste or to enact regulations to address the hazard &#8212; amounted to
impermissibly
'commandeering' State legislatures.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading49"></a><b>B	</b><b><i>Printz v United
States</i>:</b><sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup><b> The
anti-commandeering doctrine expands</b></h3>
<h4>
<a name="Heading51"></a><b><i>1	Facts and findings of </i></b><b>Printz v United
States</b></h4>
<p>Five years after <i>New York</i>, the Supreme Court expanded the
anti-commandeering principle in <i>Printz v United States</i>. As well as
forbidding Congress from attempting to commandeer State legislative processes,
the principle categorically rendered impermissible
congressional attempts to
require State executive officials to enforce federal law. </p>
<p>The <i>Brady Handgun Violence Prevention
Act</i><sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup> ('<i>Brady Act</i>') was
enacted by Congress in 1993 to amend the <i>Gun Control Act of
1968</i>.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup> It required the
Department of Justice to develop a national system for conducting background
checks on would-be firearms purchasers
within five years of its enactment. In
the meantime, the <i>Brady Act</i> contained interim provisions establishing a
temporary scheme of background checks. Chief among these was the requirement
that firearm
dealers were to obtain a statement from the potential gun buyer
vouching for his or her eligibility on a 'Brady form'. The firearms
dealers then
had to provide the 'chief law enforcement officer' ('CLEO') of the purchaser's
county with a copy of the Brady form.
The CLEO was then required to make a
reasonable effort to ascertain within five business days whether the proposed
handgun sale would
violate federal, State or local law. If the CLEO found that
the sale would be illegal and notified the dealer, the CLEO was required
to
provide written reasons for denial within twenty days of a request by the
prospective buyer. </p>
<p>Two CLEOs contended that the interim provisions of the <i>Brady Act</i> were
unconstitutional to the extent that they imposed an obligation on State
officials to execute federal laws. Scalia J, joined
by Rehnquist CJ and
O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas JJ, agreed and set out the rule extracted
above.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading57"></a><b><i>2	The reasoning in </i></b><b>Printz v United
States</b></h4>
<p>In coming to his conclusion Scalia J acknowledged that there is no
constitutional text speaking to the precise question of whether
congressional
action compelling State officers to execute federal laws is unconstitutional and
set out a tripartite inquiry in the
absence of clear textual guidance: '[T]he
answer to the CLEOs' challenge must be sought in historical understanding and
practice,
in the structure of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, and in the jurisprudence
of this Court.'<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading60"></a><b><i>(a)	Historical practice and case law</i></b></h4>
<p>Scalia J first presented arguments drawn from 'historical understanding and
practice' and 'the jurisprudence' of the Supreme Court.
Bearing in mind that
early congressional enactments 'provide "contemporaneous and weighty evidence"
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>'s
meaning',<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup> he considered and
dismissed the record of early federal statutes that could be said to effectively
commandeer some form of State
function. To Scalia J's mind, those </p>
<blockquote>
early laws establish, at most, that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was originally
understood to permit imposition of an obligation on state <i>judges</i> [rather
than state executive officials] to enforce federal prescriptions, insofar as
those prescriptions related to matters appropriate
for the judicial
power.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>Scalia J
also treated as significant what he considered 'an absence of
executive-commandeering statutes &#8230; in our later history
as well, at least
until very recent years.'<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Scalia J's recourse to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>'s 'history and structure' in
order to reach his decision in <i>Printz</i> has found support in the
literature. The United States' eighteenth century <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></p>
<blockquote>
is a remarkably concise and necessarily general document. Its object was to
create a structure of government, not a detailed code.
Thus, it is not
surprising that its text often fails to address the <i>precise</i> questions
that courts must decide. This failure, however, does not mean that the courts
have no text to construe in such cases or
that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> provides
no meaningful guidance. To the contrary, in such cases, courts properly perform
their traditional function of interpreting
the generally worded provisions of
the text ... in light of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>'s history and
structure.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Nevertheless,
Scalia J acknowledged that the historical sources were not conclusive one way or
another.<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a></sup> Supporters of the
<i>Printz</i> rule generally accept that there is 'much ambiguity in the
historical understanding, an understanding [that is] not
dispositive.'<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[35]</a></sup></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading73"></a><b><i>(b)	The 'dual sovereignty' structure of the
</i></b><b>Constitution</b></h4>
<p>Having determined that 'the constitutional practice &#8230; examined above
tends to negate the existence of the congressional power
asserted here, but is
not conclusive'<sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a></sup> Scalia J turned
'next to consideration of the structure of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, to see if we can
discern among its "essential postulate[s]", a principle that controls the
present case.'<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>The relevant controlling principle, as identified by Scalia J, is the 'system
of "dual sovereignty."'<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></sup> He
stated that, 'although the States surrendered many of their powers to the new
Federal Government, they retained "a residuary and
inviolable
sovereignty"'.<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a></sup> Claiming that
this historical fact 'is reflected throughout the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>'s
text'<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a></sup> Scalia J listed a
number of constitutional provisions as
examples.<sup><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a></sup> Without examining how
these provisions combine to support the idea of 'inviolable' State sovereignty,
Scalia J's argument moved on
to the aspect of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> upon which
supporters of States' rights and dual sovereignty have traditionally depended:
the Tenth Amendment. The Amendment states:
'The powers not delegated to the
United States by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, nor prohibited by it to the States,
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'</p>
<p>Scalia J interpreted the Amendment as a substantive restriction on
congressional power: </p>
<blockquote>
Residual state sovereignty was also implicit, of course, in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>'s conferral upon Congress of not all governmental powers,
but only discrete, enumerated ones, Art. I, &#167; 8, which implication
was
rendered express by the Tenth
Amendment.<sup><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Scalia
J's 'dual sovereignty' argument is crucial to the <i>Printz </i>rule. The logic
of 'dual sovereignty' is said to unconditionally forbid commandeering:</p>
<blockquote>
It is in this fashion that a <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> that contains 'no ... text
speaking to this precise question' can nonetheless provide substantial text that
presupposes inviolable
state sovereignty. This argument is the crux of the
structural analysis. By implication, because states are sovereign over their
own
executive officers, any federal commandeering would violate state
sovereignty.<sup><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[43]</a></sup></blockquote><h4>
<a name="Heading88"></a><b><i>(c)	Extending the principle in </i></b><b>New York
</b></h4>
<p>The provisions referred to in the above paragraph, culminating in the Tenth
Amendment, amount to the entirety of that part of Scalia
J's argument that can
be said to be derived from the structural constraints contained within the text
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. This methodology has been criticised for presenting
'a final formalist position &#8230; rather than an
argument'.<sup><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[44]</a></sup> Having presented this
list of provisions as evidence, Scalia J elaborated no further before concluding
this part of his argument
by stating that '[t]he Framers rejected the concept of
a central government that would act upon and through the States, and instead
designed a system in which the State and Federal Governments would exercise
concurrent authority over the
people'.<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[45]</a></sup> He then quoted from
<i>New York</i>: '"[T]he Framers explicitly chose a <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> that
confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not
States."'<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[46]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Scalia J's selective quoting sidestepped the issue of the supremacy of
federal law; this issue is examined below. What is instructive
in Scalia J's
approach is the manner in which he invoked <i>New York</i> as a discursive link
between his unspoken reliance on an interpretive position which views the Tenth
Amendment as a substantive restraint
on congressional power, and his ultimate
conclusion that the commandeering of State officers was unconstitutional. The
prohibition
against commandeering State officials was presented as an inevitable
logical extrapolation of the rule in <i>New York</i> prohibiting the
commandeering of State legislatures. And so the provision in the <i>Brady
Act</i> requiring CLEOs to 'make a reasonable effort to ascertain within 5
business days whether receipt or possession [of a handgun] would
be in violation
of the law'<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[47]</a></sup> was found to be
unconstitutional.<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>To some supporters of the <i>Printz</i> rule it is unproblematic that the
final steps in Scalia J's argument were not elaborated more fully, because the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> clearly 'presupposes' such a rule:</p>
<blockquote>
[T]he Supreme Court's anti-commandeering rule...is simply one of the
prophylactic devices that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> presupposes in order to
implement a <i>structure</i> of government with sufficient checks and balances
to secure 'the rights of the
people.'<sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[49]</a></sup></blockquote><h4>
<a name="Heading99"></a><b><i>3	Criticising the reasoning of the
</i></b><b>Printz<i> majority</i></b></h4>
<p>Many judges and academics have taken a completely different view of the Tenth
Amendment, and criticism of the majority decision in
<i>Printz </i>has been
extensive.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading101"></a><b><i>(a)	Criticising the extension of </i></b><b>New
York<i>: legislatures are different to officials</i></b></h4>
<p>The majority took a logically unsupported step in treating, without
explanation, the commandeering of State executive officials as
an affront to
federalism equally as egregious as the commandeering of State legislatures.
Souter J, the only Justice to join the
majority in <i>New York</i> yet dissent
in <i>Printz</i>, identified the lacunae crossed by this leap by drawing
attention to the essential differences in nature between legislative and
administrative capacity: </p>
<blockquote>
The core power of an executive officer is to enforce a law in accordance with
its terms; that is why a state executive 'auxiliary'
may be told what result to
bring about. The core power of a legislator acting within the legislature's
subject matter jurisdiction
is to make a discretionary decision on what the law
should be; that is why a legislator may not be legally ordered to exercise
discretion
a particular way without damaging the legislative power as
such.<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[50]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>Section
107 of the Australian<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, which may be read as a form of
guarantee of State legislative power, has been interpreted in ways that suggest
the High Court may
be receptive to Souter J's conception of legislative
power.<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[51]</a></sup> This is investigated
below.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading107"></a><b><i> (b)	Dual sovereignty undermines federal
supremacy</i></b></h4>
<p>The majority's conception of 'dual sovereignty' has been criticised for
conflicting with the principle of federal
supremacy.<sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[52]</a></sup> It has been argued
that it is inappropriate to conceptualise the State and federal governments as
'dual' in the sense of being 'equal'
sovereigns, for the federal government is
supreme in matters of federal
law.<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[53]</a></sup> This is made explicit in
Art. VI, &#167; 2 of the <i>US <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, which provides that the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and laws 'made in Pursuance thereof &#8230; shall be the
supreme Law of the Land'. Federal supremacy is another 'essential postulate'
of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, one that was given insufficient weight by Scalia J.
'All sovereigns', according to Professor Caminker, 'are not created equal: "The
United States is not a foreign sovereignty as regards the several States, but is
a concurrent, and, within its jurisdiction, paramount
sovereignty."'<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[54]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The primacy of the principle of federal supremacy was affirmed by Stevens J
&#8212; joined in his dissent by Souter, Ginsburg and
Breyer JJ &#8212; at the
outset of his dissenting judgment in <i>Printz</i>: </p>
<blockquote>
When Congress exercises the powers delegated to it by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>,
it may impose affirmative obligations on executive and judicial officers of
state and local governments as well as ordinary citizens.
This conclusion is
firmly supported by the text of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> &#8230; and a correct
understanding of the basic structure of the Federal
Government.<sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[55]</a></sup> </blockquote><h4>
<a name="Heading115"></a><b><i>(c)	The Tenth Amendment, given its plain meaning,
does not restrain federal legislative power</i></b></h4>
<p>To the Australian observer, the statement in the preceding paragraph has the
sound of <i>Engineers</i>.<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[56]</a></sup>
Stevens J, in holding that the Tenth Amendment 'plainly refers only to powers
that are "<i>not</i>" delegated to
Congress,'<sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[57]</a></sup> gave the text its
plain meaning; a recognisably <i>Engineers</i>-like interpretive approach.
Stating that '[t]he text of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> provides a sufficient basis
for a correct disposition'<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[58]</a></sup> of
the case, Stevens J<i> </i>began from the proposition that Congress clearly had
power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact
the
interim provisions of the <i>Brady Act</i>, before stating that:</p>
<blockquote>
The Tenth Amendment imposes no restriction on the exercise of delegated powers
&#8230; The Amendment confirms the principle that
the powers of the Federal
Government are limited to those affirmatively granted by the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, but it does not purport to limit the scope or the
effectiveness of the exercise of powers that are delegated to Congress ... Thus,
the Amendment provides no support for a rule that immunizes local officials from
obligations that might be imposed on ordinary
citizens.<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[59]</a></sup></blockquote><h4>
<a name="Heading122"></a><b><i>(d)	Scalia J provides insufficient evidence to
sustain an interpretation of the Tenth Amendment as a restraint on federal
legislative
power</i></b></h4>
<p>Stevens J's remarks draw attention to Scalia J's under-developed
interpretation of the Tenth Amendment. It is clear that the majority
in
<i>Printz</i> relied upon the Tenth Amendment as a basis for the
anti-commandeering rule, but the Justices did not indicate how they did so.
Instead,
Scalia J treated <i>New York</i>, a case then five years old, as
authoritative on the matter and made no further effort to make a structural
argument for a more substantive
reading of the Tenth Amendment. Yet <i>New
York</i> itself, as well as failing to extend its logic to State officials (see
above), failed to elucidate the nature of the structural limit
on congressional
power inherent in the Amendment. The Tenth Amendment, according to the Supreme
Court in <i>New York</i>,</p>
<blockquote>
restrains the power of Congress, but this limit is not derived from the text of
the Tenth Amendment itself, which, as we have discussed,
is essentially a
tautology. Instead, the Tenth Amendment confirms that the power of the Federal
Government is subject to limits that
may, in a given instance, reserve power to
the States.<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[60]</a></sup></blockquote><p>If
the limit is not sourced from the Tenth Amendment but is merely 'confirmed' by
it, where does it come from? Scalia J's list of
provisions may or may not
evidence his claim that a concept of 'dual sovereignty' underlies the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, but no attempt is made to suggest that, combined, they
impose a restraint on enumerated congressional power. The 'failure to flesh
out
[this] reliance on the Tenth Amendment is particularly disappointing because
there <i>are</i> principles of state sovereignty that constrain federal
power.'<sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[61]</a></sup> </p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading128"></a><b><i>(e)	The rule in </i></b><b>Printz<i> fails to
account for the effect of conditional grants and laws of general
applicability</i></b></h4>
<p>From a functional perspective, the most important criticism of Scalia J's
structural arguments concerns the practical impact of potential
inconsistencies
in the application of the bright-line anti-commandeering rule. Bright-line rules
are said to serve the rule of law
by promoting accessibility to the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and improving the consistency of its application in
disputes.<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[62]</a></sup> However, 'they do so
only at the inevitable cost of being overinclusive or underinclusive in serving
their substantive purposes.'<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>The over-inclusive implications of <i>Printz</i> can be seen by asking two
questions. Firstly, if commandeering is threatening to State sovereignty, 'why
are state and local governments
protected only from &#8230; regulatory services
but not from <i>conditional</i> demands &#8212; that is, demands extracted by
threats of &#8230; withdrawal of grant
money?'<sup><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[64]</a></sup> Secondly, 'why do
<i>Printz</i> and <i>New York</i> allow federal regulation of both nonfederal
governments and private organizations with generally applicable
laws?'<sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[65]</a></sup> </p>
<p>If commandeering is 'incompatible' with dual sovereignty, there seems to be
no principled reason why conditional grants or generally
applicable laws with a
commandeering effect are not also incompatible, and it is 'difficult to see
&#8230; why the strict, exceptionless
rule of <i>Printz</i> is superior to a
judicial approach that would permit realistic appraisal of the operation of
federal requirements on states'.<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[66]</a></sup>
The <i>Brady Act</i> itself provides a good example of the rule's potential
inconsistency. Section 922(6)(B)(i) of the <i>Gun Control Act of 1968</i>, as
amended by the <i>Brady Act</i>, required CLEOs to destroy the Brady form of a
would-be purchaser for whom no reason could be found to find him or her
ineligible
to own a handgun. The Supreme Court found it unnecessary to decide
the constitutionality of this provision. If expressed in the form
of a command
to local officials to destroy certain forms, the provision would violate the
anti-commandeering principle; 'but if expressed
as a prohibition against
retention of certain forms by anyone, including private citizens, the
requirement would seem constitutionally
unobjectionable.'<sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[67]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In this way, laws of general application threatened to render the rule in
<i>Printz</i> ridiculous.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading139"></a><b><i>4	The problem of laws imposing negative
obligations: </i></b><b>Reno v
Condon<sup><i><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[68]</a></i></sup></b></h4>
<p>The limitations of the rule in <i>Printz</i> when confronted by laws of
general application, or one imposing a negative obligation, were exposed in 2000
in the case of <i>Reno v Condon</i>. The <i>Driver's Privacy Protection Act of
1994 </i>('<i>DPP Act</i>') was a federal statute prohibiting States from
disclosing personal information gained by the State Department of Motor
Vehicles.<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[69]</a></sup>  The Supreme Court
upheld the law. The <i>DPP Act</i>, according to Rehnquist CJ, did not violate
the Tenth Amendment because it was a prohibition of conduct, not an affirmative
command
as in <i>Printz v United
States</i>.<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>With <i>Reno v Condon</i> the Supreme Court demonstrated that it was
unwilling to push its new doctrine to its logical conclusions. Congress, the
<i>Reno v Condon</i> Court decided, could not impose an affirmative duty on
State officials to execute federal laws but may impose a negative duty,
particularly
if the negative duty is imposed on private citizens as
well.<sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[71]</a></sup> This evolutionary twist in
the development of the anti-commandeering doctrine lacks principled foundations.
Most duties can be characterised
either way. The distinction between affirmative
and negative duties is thus a victory for form over substance. The <i>DPP
Act</i>, for example, could be said to impose an 'affirmative duty on states to
keep information secret.'<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[72]</a></sup> The
<i>Brady Act</i> 'could be characterized as a prohibition on state and local
governments from issuing gun permits without doing background
checks.'<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[73]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Supreme Court's implicit endorsement of otherwise potentially
impermissible regulation of State officers because the law also
applies to
private entities, that is, because the <i>DPP Act</i> was a law of general
application,<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[74]</a></sup> is equally
problematic. The acerbic words of Stevens J come to mind: 'A structural problem
that vanishes when the statute affects
private individuals as well as public
officials is not much of a structural
problem.'<sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[75]</a></sup>  </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading151"></a><b>II	</b><b><i>PRINTZ</i> AND THE TEXT AND STRUCTURE
OF THE AUSTRALIAN<i> CONSTITUTION</i></b></h2>
<h3>
<a name="Heading152"></a><b>A	Searching for </b><b><i>Printz</i> in the text of
the Australian<i> Constitution</i> </b></h3>
<p>In Australia, as the joint judgment noted in
<i>Austin</i>,<sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[76]</a></sup> an
anti-commandeering rule could only operate outside the scope of the range of
provisions that expressly mandate the imposition
of certain federal duties upon
State officers and bodies. These officers and bodies include Governors (ss 7,
12, 15), Parliaments
(ss 9, 15) and courts (s 77(iii)). Section 120 obliges the
States to hold federal prisoners. </p>
<p>The Tenth Amendment has provided a textual focus for various federally
derived limitations on congressional power in the United States.
In Australia no
single provision provides a similar focus. It has been suggested, however, that
an echo of the Tenth Amendment found
in ss 106 and 107 may cause certain
principles of State constitutional law to limit the operation of Commonwealth
legislative power.<sup><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[77]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Section 106 provides that '[t]he <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> of each State of the
Commonwealth shall, subject to this <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, continue as at the
establishment of the Commonwealth &#8230; until altered in accordance with the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> of the State.'</p>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 107</a> provides that '[e]very power of &#8230; a State, shall, unless it
is by this <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> exclusively vested in the Parliament of the
Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of the State, continue as at the
establishment
of the Commonwealth ...'</p>
<p>Neither section can support a strong limitation on Commonwealth power such as
an anti-commandeering rule. If interpreted in a textual
manner faithful to the
<i>Engineers</i>' <i>Case</i>, the phrase 'subject to this <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>'
ensures that Commonwealth powers are unencumbered by limitations imposed by
State <i>Constitutions</i>, even to the extent that the operation of those
powers alters a State's
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[78]</a></sup> This is
notwithstanding that the Commonwealth's legislative powers in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51</a> are
themselves 'subject to this <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>', as the High Court has held
that the powers in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51</a> are to be interpreted 'with all the generality which the
words used admit'.<sup><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[79]</a></sup> The case law
supports this interpretation: although a number of cases have considered whether
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 106</a> acts as a distinct limit on Commonwealth
power,<sup><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[80]</a></sup> since <i>Melbourne
Corporation </i>the provision has more commonly been considered as a component
of the broader foundation for limitations on Commonwealth power implied
by the
federal structure of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>The High Court interpreted <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 107</a> in the <i>Native Title Act</i> <i>Case</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
It is &#8230; beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth Parliament to
withdraw from any State Parliament a legislative power
that is conferred on or
confirmed to that Parliament by s 107. Nor does the Parliament of the
Commonwealth have power directly to
control the content of a State
law.<sup><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[82]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In <i>New
South Wales v Commonwealth</i>, the joint judgment took care to dismiss any
suggestion that s 107 reserves powers to the States, affirming that </p>
<blockquote>
[s]ection 107 does not vest exclusive powers in the State legislatures ...
[Section] 107 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> &#8230; reserves to the parliaments of
the States only those powers not exclusively vested in the Federal Parliament or
<i>withdrawn</i> from the parliaments of the States. The relevant question
presented by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 107</a> thus is what legislative power the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> grants
to the Federal Parliament, not what the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> prohibits or
reserves.<sup><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[83]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
passage from the <i>Native Title Act Case </i>resonates, to an extent, with
<i>New York</i>. In <i>New York</i> it was held that Congress could neither
compel a State government to accept ownership of waste, nor in the alternative
require a
State to legislate in accordance with federal regulations. The second
limb of this principle is arguably a logical extrapolation
of the comments made
in the <i>Native Title Act Case</i>. However, the federal governments in both
Australia and the US have no need to rely on 'direct' methods of coercing State
legislatures.
In <i>New York</i> the Supreme Court confirmed that Congress may
'encourage' States to legislate in a certain manner by attaching conditions to
federal
funds.<sup><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[84]</a></sup> Likewise, in
Australia it has been open to the Commonwealth to attach conditions of
legislative action to grants made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s96.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 96</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> since
the two <i>Uniform Tax
Cases</i>.<sup><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[85]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Although <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 107</a> may support a <i>New York</i>-style rule, neither <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 107</a> nor <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
106</a> offers a textual basis for a rule prohibiting the commandeering of State
officials by the Commonwealth. The two provisions do support
some limitations on
Commonwealth power: together they provide a basis for inferring that 'subject to
alteration of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a>, the States are to continue as

legislatures.'<sup><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[86]</a></sup></p>

the federation, but the ability of the States to exercise power as independent
entities. In <i>Melbourne Corporation</i>,<i> </i>the High Court accepted that
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>'s federal structure acts as a 'restraint upon the use of
[Commonwealth legislative] power to control the
States'.<sup><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[87]</a></sup> The nature of this
restraint remains less than certain. The latest formulation of the test for
State immunity was set out in the
2003 case of <i>Austin</i>: </p>
<blockquote>
The question presented by the doctrine in any given case requires assessment of
the impact of particular laws by such criteria as
'special burden' and
'curtailment' of 'capacity' of the States to 'function as governments'. These
criteria are to be applied by
consideration not only of the form but also 'the
substance and actual operation' of the federal
law.<sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[88]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Later in the
joint judgment, the judges considered the significance of discrimination as an
element of the test:</p>
<blockquote>
[The] issue [of the relevance of discrimination] may be narrowed by asking
whether that result comes about by a sufficiently significant
impairment of the
exercise by the State of its freedom to select the manner and method for
discharge of its constitutional functions
respecting the remuneration of the
judges of the courts of the
State.<sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[89]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The joint
judgment's formulation of the test for breaching State immunity was supported by
Kirby J.<sup><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>After <i>Austin</i>, one question is to be answered when determining whether
a Commonwealth legislative action is defeated by the doctrine of State immunity:
does the law impair the capacity of the State or States to function as a
government? This approach calls for impugned Commonwealth
legislation to be
examined on a case-by-case basis. A <i>Printz</i> rule, by holding that the
commandeering of State officers always impairs the capacity of the States to
function as governments, would
dispense with this case-by-case approach and add
a bright-line anti-commandeering rule to the doctrine of State immunity. </p>
<p>The High Court has adopted a uniform test to determine when such doctrinal
expansions or refinements are appropriate: the 'logically
or practically
necessary' test. Any proposed new rule 'must be logically or practically
necessary for the preservation of the integrity
of [the constitutional]
structure'.<sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[91]</a></sup> In practice, the bar
may be higher for bright-line rules, three judges having indicated a preference
for more abstract formulations:</p>
<blockquote>
Because the limitation on power is derived from the federal structure, it is
difficult, if not impossible, to articulate it except
in negative terms which
are cast at a high level of abstraction
&#8230;<sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[92]</a></sup></blockquote><p>This
structural bias towards abstraction underlines the difficulty of supporting a
<i>Printz</i> rule under 'logically and practically necessary' reasoning. For a
<i>Printz</i> rule to be applied it must be 'logically or practically necessary
for the preservation' of Australia's federal structure that a prohibition
on the
commandeering of State officials in all circumstances be added to the doctrine
as formulated in <i>Austin</i>. </p>
<p>The rest of this Part applies the 'logically and practically necessary' test
to <i>Printz</i>, and asks: is the federal structure adequately protected
against commandeering by the case-by-case approach in <i>Austin</i>? Or, is
commandeering so repugnant to federalism that it always and inevitably impairs
the capacity of the States to function as
independent governments; is it
consequently 'logically or practically necessary for the preservation of the
[federal] structure'
to apply a bright-line rule categorically prohibiting such
laws? Underlying these questions is the understanding of the nature of
the
federal structure in <i>Melbourne Corporation</i>: the federal structure
reserves for the States not spheres of power, but the capacity to exercise power
independently.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading193"></a><b><i>2	The argument in </i></b><b>Austin v
Commonwealth</b></h4>
<p>In <i>Austin</i>, South Australia, represented by its Solicitor-General, B M
Selway QC (as he then was), objected to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sctocpsfaaca19971271/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sctocpsfaaca19971271/" class="autolink_findacts">Superannuation
Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds)
Assessment and Collection Act 1997</a></i> (Cth) ('<i>Assessment Act</i>'). The
provision required the State to employ an actuary to calculate the amount of the
'surchargeable contributions' required under
s 9 of the <i>Assessment Act</i>.
According to Selway:</p>
<blockquote>
The calculation required by the Act is complex and difficult. The Commonwealth
cannot validly legislate so as unilaterally to impose
a duty upon the State or
an officer of the State to perform an executive function under a Commonwealth
Act.<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[93]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Selway,
acknowledging that 'the States and their officers &#8230; are not immune from
general duties and obligations imposed on them
by Commonwealth
legislation',<sup><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[94]</a></sup> argued that it was
beyond the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to impose executive duties on
State officers and, citing <i>Printz</i>, noted that in the United States
'federal law cannot require State officials to assist with the enforcement of
federal statutes'.<sup><a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[95]</a></sup> In
<i>AEU</i>, Selway continued, it was established that:</p>
<blockquote>
The Commonwealth cannot exercise its powers so as to control the States as
governmental polities. It is necessarily inconsistent
with the independence of
the States for the Commonwealth to have power unilaterally to direct the State
or its employees to perform
Commonwealth
duties.<sup><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[96]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
<i>AEU</i>, six judges defined 'control' as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
The exercise of Commonwealth power 'to control the States' would be an exercise
of power inconsistent with the continued existence
of the States as independent
entities and their capacity to function as
such.<sup><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[97]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Therefore,
the claim made by Selway was that the actuarial duties imposed by s 12 of the
<i>Assessment Act</i> threatened the continued existence of the States as
independent entities and their capacity to so function. It is the provenance,
not the content, of the obligation that is decisive: regardless of the nature of
the duty, Selway argued, its imposition by the Commonwealth
'necessarily'
undermines a State's capacity to function as an independent entity. Therefore,
he concluded, a categorical bright-line
rule of the type laid down in
<i>Printz</i> is needed to preserve the federal structure of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.</p>
<p>The High Court did not need to consider Selway's argument in reaching its
conclusion in <i>Austin</i>. The <i>Assessment Act</i> offended the <i>Melbourne
Corporation</i> doctrine not because of the complexity and difficulty of the
actuarial duties imposed on the States, but because it 'interfere[d]
in a
significant respect with the States' relationships with their
judges'.<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[98]</a></sup> What follows is the
first response to Selway's argument on its merits.</p>
<p>The first suggestion of the problems inherent in adopting a categorical
stance on this issue is found in Selway's own words, in a
passage extracted
above: the actuarial duties imposed by the <i>Assessment Act</i> are described
as 'complex and difficult'. In the context of an argument that the content of
the duty is of no consequence, this claim
seems incongruous, if not irrelevant.
It may be treated as an invitation to examine the difficulty of the requirement
in ss 9 and
12, and to assess whether it is in fact so onerous as to threaten
the independence of the State. The relative advantages and disadvantages
of a
case-by-case approach as against a categorical rule can be demonstrated by such
an exercise.</p>
<p>Section 9 of the <i>Assessment Act</i> provided that 'surchargeable
contributions' were 'the amounts that constitute the actuarial value of the
benefits that accrued to,
and the value of administrative expenses and risk
benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year'. The
'actuarial
value' was calculated by multiplying the member's annual salary by a
'notional surchargeable contributions factor' ('NSCF') which
was worked out by
an actuary.<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[99]</a></sup></p>
<p>The relative difficulty and complexity of the task imposed by ss 9 and 12 was
subject to several variables, most significant of which
was the complexity of
calculating the NSCF. It is unclear whether it was a calculation that could
easily be done by existing State
government-employed actuaries based on easily
obtainable data, or whether the State would be obliged to employ a private
actuary
to perform a highly involved calculation at considerable expense. In the
first instance, the burden on State resources would arguably
be negligible; in
the latter, arguably not. In either case, in an echo of the complaint of the two
CLEOs in <i>Printz</i>, Selway's objection to the <i>Assessment Act</i> as
'complex and difficult' would seem to be an objection to the Commonwealth's
indirect consumption of State resources, resources
which presumably would
otherwise be used for State purposes. As a trigger for the <i>Melbourne
Corporation</i> doctrine, this objection is baseless: the Commonwealth does not
'control' the States in the sense of the word used by the High Court
in
<i>AEU</i> by diverting State resources from State purposes by taxation or
analogous methods.<sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>Selway invited the High Court to find that conscripting State officers for
Commonwealth functions inevitably amounts to controlling
'the States as
governmental polities'. The very statute from which he launches this claim
demonstrates the over-inclusiveness of
the rule. The 'controlling' effect of the
conscription provisions in the <i>Assessment Act</i> cannot be said to impair
the capacity of the States to function as independent governments because the
duty is 'complex and difficult',
if by that it is meant that performance of the
duty will consume State resources. More broadly damaging to the case for a
categorical
rule is the realisation, hinted at by Selway in the words 'complex
and difficult', that the controlling effect of commandeering provisions
is a
question of degree.</p>

of this article; the two other grounds were in any case dispensed with by
Siopis
J in short order. </p>
<p>Before both Siopis J and the Full Federal Court, the appellants argued
that</p>

in the absence of something appearing in the particular grant of Commonwealth

administrative duty on a Commonwealth officer without Commonwealth
legislative
approval.<sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[104]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Of
course, the imposition of functions on State officers by the Commonwealth raises
constitutional issues, particularly the operation

of functions on Commonwealth officers by the States, as Siopis J correctly
noted.<sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[105]</a></sup></p>

<i>Zentai v Republic of Hungary</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2007/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[2007] FCAFC 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282007%29%20157%20FCR%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2007) 157 FCR 585</a> at 589, this proposition
involves a 'large proposition' which was not in those cases, and is not in this
case, necessary to decide
and therefore is 'best left for another
day'.<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[110]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The High
Court confronts the same questions of statutory construction that decided the
case in the courts below. If the Court does
find it necessary to decide the
constitutional issue, it is submitted that the appellants' arguments ought to be
rejected, for the
reasons considered above and below in this article. If the
High Court finds, contrary to the finding of the Federal Court, that State
magistrates have been conscripted for federal purposes without State legislative
approval, that may indeed offend against the <i>Melbourne Corporation
</i>doctrine. However, it is submitted that it would be inappropriate to lay
down a bright-line rule prohibiting the conscription of State
officers for
federal purposes in all cases. It is appropriate at this point to consider how
the proposition put by Zentai, Williams
and O'Donoghue, a recognisably
<i>Printz-</i>like proposition, might operate within the <i>Melbourne
Corporation</i> doctrine.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading268"></a><b><i>4	Some hypothetical examples of the difficulty of
applying a </i></b><b>Printz<i> rule</i></b></h4>
<p>Hypothetical examples, based on examples from Australian case law history,
further illuminate the variables at play in these matters
and the inevitably
over-inclusive effect of a <i>Printz</i> rule. In the <i>First Uniform Tax
Case</i>, the constitutional validity of the conscription of State public
servants concerned with tax collection by the <i>Income Tax (War-Time
Arrangements) Act 1942</i> (Cth) was upheld, providing 'a striking illustration
of the defence power'.<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[111]</a></sup> If the
Commonwealth were to attempt a similar wholesale conscription of public servants
&#8212; as well as the property of State
taxation departments &#8212; outside of
wartime, such an enterprise could not be characterised as a law with regard to s
51(vi).
If attempted under another head of power, conscription on the same scale
authorised in the <i>First Uniform Tax Case</i> could be said to impair a State
in the exercise of its functions as an independent governmental entity; it would
amount to commandeering
part of the State's basic capacity to raise revenue,
leaving the States more dependent on the Commonwealth's capacity in that regard.
If, on the other hand, the Commonwealth required a State taxation official to
provide records of State taxes levied and the amount
raised over the past year,
that could hardly be said to have the same effect: even if the relevant official
were occupied by her
or his task for some time, the business of raising revenue
would continue without any real impediment.</p>
<p>Three years after <i>Engineers</i>, in the case of <i>Commonwealth v New
South Wales</i>,<sup><a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[112]</a></sup> the High
Court held that the power in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51(xxxi)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> did not
support a law requiring the States to register land compulsorily acquired by the
Commonwealth without complying with State
law concerning registration. Leaving
aside rule of law considerations and the potential involvement of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 109</a>, if
examined from a post-<i>Melbourne Corporation</i> post-<i>Austin</i>
perspective, such an action could be said to be an exercise of power
inconsistent with the continued independence of the States.
Directing State
officers to work around State law strikes at the heart of the independence of
the States; it subverts the role of
a State's executive branch, which is to
'execute' the law, by turning it against the law created by its own legislative
branch. However,
if the impugned Commonwealth law had directed State officials
to register land 'expeditiously and as an urgent priority' in accordance
with
State law, the issue would be avoided. Registering a change in land ownership as
quickly as legally possible would not turn
State officers against State law, and
so would not undermine the independence of the States in the same manner.</p>
<p>Reflection upon the above scenarios, the interaction of limitless variables,
and the uncountable permutations of potential legislative
responses to national
challenges, suggests the following conclusion: the case-by-case approach in
<i>Austin</i> is desirable because it obliges judges to engage closely with the
facts to produce a logically sensible outcome. Commandeering measures
can impact
States in many ways and to different degrees; to apply the same categorical rule
in all cases is to fail to appreciate
'the range of human affairs, the scope of
executive and legislative activity, and the necessity for close analysis of
complex and
varied statutory
schemes'.<sup><a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[113]</a></sup> </p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading275"></a><b><i>5	A bright-line rule would be logically
inconsistent with the reasoning in </i></b><b>AEU</b></h4>
<p>Put simply, the commandeering of State officers may or may not be repugnant
to the federal structure of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, depending upon the
operation of the law. This pragmatism pervades the very case upon which Selway
places such great reliance: <i>AEU</i>. In that case, rather than treating all
State employees as the same and subject to one categorical and sweeping rule,
the six judges
of the majority made a distinction between the importance of
different 'levels' of employee to the capacity of the State to exist
independently.<sup><a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[114]</a></sup></p>
<p>By stating that the Commonwealth could not interfere with the setting of the
terms and conditions of employment for certain high levels
of employee, the High
Court implicitly countenanced the setting of terms and conditions for other
categories of State employee. If
the right to determine the terms and conditions
of employment with regard to some classes of employee is prima facie 'critical
to
a State's capacity to function as a government' but not with regard to other
classes, there is a logical inconsistency in proceeding
to hold that the right
to resist the commandeering of all State officers or employees, regardless of
the nature of their position,
is similarly 'critical'.</p>
<p>The lone dissenter, Dawson J, believed the distinction drawn by the majority
suffered from artificiality.<sup><a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[115]</a></sup>
It is certainly difficult to weigh the issues posed by the facts of cases such
as <i>AEU</i> and the hypothetical scenarios considered above. Nevertheless, as
Professor Zines has observed: 'Questions of degree and balance
cannot be
avoided. That is to be expected when what is at issue is the "federal
system".'<sup><a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[116]</a></sup> Attempts to balance
the issues cannot be avoided if the High Court is to adequately engage with the
facts; the role of normative
arguments in this process is explored in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part III.</a>
The problem identified by Dawson J is only exacerbated by the operation of
bright-line rules: if the many forms in which employment
by a State can occur
militate against the establishment of even so open a category as that set out by
the majority in <i>AEU</i>, so much more so do they demonstrate the deficiencies
of a bright-line approach. By examining the function of a particular State
employee a court can determine whether it belongs in the critically protected
category or not; if all employees are automatically
extended such protection,
inevitably many whose function is simply not critical to the independence of a
State will be shielded for
no logical reason. </p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading282"></a><b><i>6	Conceptualising </i></b><b>Printz<i> as a
return to discrimination</i></b></h4>
<p>The authors of the joint judgment in <i>Austin</i> suggested that the first
limb of the test in <i>QEC</i>, the discrimination element, is not sufficient
'to attract the <i>Melbourne Corporation</i> doctrine' of itself without
evidence of the '"curtailment" of "capacity" of the States "to function as
governments"'.<sup><a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[117]</a></sup> Since that
decision there have been calls for the reintroduction of a structured role for
discrimination within the <i>Melbourne Corporation</i>
doctrine.<sup><a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[118]</a></sup> A <i>Printz</i>
rule may be seen as the vehicle for this reintroduction. Could it be said that a
law providing for the conscription of State officers
for a federal purpose is a
discriminatory law which prima facie impairs the capacity of the States to
function as independent governments?
The alien <i>Printz</i> rule would be
linked to Australian constitutional history, and discrimination elevated to a
level above mere indicia: commandeering
would be a form of discrimination
guaranteed to infringe the <i>Melbourne Corporation</i> doctrine. </p>
<p><i>QEC</i> clarified that, for the purposes of State immunity, discrimination
encompasses ideas of indirect discrimination: </p>
<blockquote>
The question whether a law does so discriminate against the States or a
particular State is &#8230; a question of substance which
is not susceptible of
being resolved by the mere inquiry whether, as a matter of form, the law is a
general or a special
one.<sup><a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[119]</a></sup></blockquote><p>This
conception of discrimination, if applied as part of an anti-commandeering rule,
would protect the High Court from form over substance
absurdities such as the
result in <i>Reno v
Condon</i>.<sup><a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[120]</a></sup> However, it would
not immunise the High Court's reasoning from difficulties encountered in
grounding discrimination as a stable test.
Discrimination revolves around a
point of comparison. This point moves through the universe of human
relationships and, as Gaudron,
Gummow and Hayne JJ appeared to
appreciate,<sup><a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[121]</a></sup> sometimes it
cannot be located. What if, for example, the <i>Assessment Act</i> applied to
both State and federal judges, and imposed the actuarial obligation on the
States and the Commonwealth &#8212; could the
law be said to discriminate
against the States? Discrimination or not, the same 'curtailment' or
'impairment' factors which decided
<i>Austin</i> would still apply. </p>
<p>Ultimately, discrimination is not the decisive factor: it is not a 'logically
or practically necessary' aspect of the doctrine of
State immunity. It is, as
the joint judgment in <i>Austin</i> realised, one factor to be taken into
consideration. The breach of the State immunity doctrine depends on the gravity
of the burden
imposed on the State. Discrimination may or may not be indicative
of impairment of the capacity of the States to function as independent
governments, and this is as true for commandeering as for more general questions
of State immunity.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading293"></a><b>C	The structural arguments do not support a
bright-line rule</b></h3>
<p>It cannot be decisively demonstrated that the unqualified prohibition of the
practice of commandeering State officials for Commonwealth
functions is
'logically or practically necessary' for the 'preservation' of the
Constitution's federal structure. Commandeering State
officials may or may not
amount to an impairment of a State's capacity to function as an independent
government, depending on the
content of the duty and the nature of the
official's position: the facts must be carefully assessed and balanced in each
instance.
The current formulation of the State immunity test, as set out in
<i>Austin</i>, is adequate for this task. As the effect of commandeering State
personnel is not to undermine the 'constitutional integrity of the
States' in
every instance, a bright-line rule prohibiting all such acts is beyond the scope
of the implication that may be drawn
from the <i>Constitution's</i> federal
structure under the 'logically and practically necessary' test.</p>
<p>Of course, the High Court's narrow focus on what is logically and practically
necessary, and the limitations of the <i>Melbourne Corporation</i> approach to
State immunity more generally, are controlled by the legacy of the <i>Engineers'
Case</i>. The analysis of Selway's argument in <i>Printz</i>, the findings of
the Federal Court in <i>Zentai</i>, and the hypothetical examples suggest that a
bright-line <i>Printz</i>-style rule cannot exist within a broader doctrine of
State immunity controlled by <i>Engineers</i>. Supporters of a categorical ban
on the conscription of State officers for Commonwealth purposes may be better
served by arguments
that leave the <i>Engineers</i> legacy to one side. </p>
<p>Although demonstrably over-inclusive and not 'logically and practically
necessary', a <i>Printz</i> rule, it may be argued, would nonetheless benefit
Australian federalism in a variety of ways. These are considered in Part
III.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading297"></a><b>III	BEYOND THE STRUCTURAL ARGUMENTS: CONCEPTUALISING
FEDERALISM</b></h2>
<h3>
<a name="Heading298"></a><b>A	The case for theory in federalism discourse and
the limits of reasoning from constitutional structure</b></h3>
<p>It is not enough to rely on the structural arguments. When arguing from the
federal structure of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> 'it is difficult, if not
impossible, to articulate it' other than 'at a high level of
abstraction'.<sup><a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[122]</a></sup> Arguing in the
name of 'necessity' at this abstract level has been criticised as 'superficial'
for '[i]t appears to offer judges
the "safe harbour" of constitutional text and
structure'<sup><a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[123]</a></sup> while masking
normative choices. Federalism, as it manifests as a structural feature of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, is too amorphous and ill-defined to provide decisive
arguments one way or another on questions such as commandeering. Without
normative
arguments, a logical impasse can be
reached.<sup><a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[124]</a></sup> </p>
<p>There are numerous examples of such an impasse. In <i>Printz</i> itself,
'plausible structural arguments supported either
side.'<sup><a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[125]</a></sup> The <i>First
Territories Senators</i>
<i>Case</i><sup><a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[126]</a></sup> was a federalism
case 'upon which different minds might reach different conclusions, no one view
being inherently entitled to any
pre-eminence'.<sup><a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[127]</a></sup> The
disagreement between Gleeson CJ and the authors of the joint judgment and Kirby
J in <i>Austin</i> is a clear example of how the concept of 'necessity' can be
adapted to suit opposing arguments. Adrienne Stone's comment in relation
to
<i>Coleman v Power</i><sup><a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[128]</a></sup> could
as easily have been made with respect to <i>Austin</i>: 'all these judges
disagree <i>despite their adherence to the text and structure method, including
the concept of
necessity</i>.'<sup><a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[129]</a></sup></p>
<p>State immunity arguments must, of course, adhere to the text and structure of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. However, an additional stream of reasoning is necessary
to justify the chosen interpretation of the constitutional structure. In
a
famous speech, Sir Anthony Mason referred to this stream as the 'balancing of
interests', and noted that '[a]n ideal solution would
look to a balancing of the
respective federal and state interests within a framework of constitutional
principle'.<sup><a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[130]</a></sup> This Part
examines the normative arguments for a <i>Printz </i>rule within such a
framework. </p>
<p>The High Court has provided such a 'framework of constitutional principle' in
the concept of 'dual federation', which is said to be
inherent within the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[131]</a></sup> Dual
federation provides for power to be divided vertically between the Commonwealth
and the States across all three arms of
government.<sup><a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[132]</a></sup> Sir Anthony
Mason's 'balancing of interests' may be taken to mean a process of evaluating
competing conceptions of the concept of
dual federation; 'conceptions' being
theoretical interpretations of 'concepts'.<sup>
<a name="fnB134" href="#fn134">[133]</a></sup> In this way the distinction drawn
between concepts and conceptions can be a helpful model for discussing how
normative 'interests'
are to be weighted. Two principal conceptions are commonly
used to explain the concept of dual federation: 'cooperative' and 'coordinate'
federalism.<sup><a name="fnB135" href="#fn135">[134]</a></sup> This article does
not seek to place a <i>Printz</i> rule in either camp. The point is that
advocates of a <i>Printz</i> rule are advocating a conception of federalism, be
it coordinate, cooperative or a more complex (and possibly more sophisticated)
vision.</p>
<p>Great difficulty is encountered when choosing one conception over another
solely on the basis of what is necessary to preserve the
text and structure of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. As has been demonstrated, arguing from a platform of
'necessity' may mask normative assumptions. Given that conclusion, the reader
may validly question the basis on which the examples of what would and what
would not necessarily be an infringement of the State
immunity doctrine were
argued in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II.</a> Even if specific examples are questioned, however, they serve
to demonstrate that the threat to the capacity of the States to exercise
power
independently is a graded threat: a question of degree. If it is accepted that
the consequence of commandeering is a question
of degree, then the conceptual
possibility of over-inclusiveness becomes a conceptual inevitability. A
bright-line anti-commandeering
rule cannot avoid over-inclusive applications.
The normative arguments considered below must be weighed against this fact in
the
ultimate conclusion. To amount to a case for the adoption of a <i>Printz</i>
rule, despite its over-inclusiveness, the normative arguments must be strongly
in its favour.</p>
<p>In addressing the normative arguments for and against a bright-line rule
prohibiting the commandeering of State officers for Commonwealth
functions (an
Australian <i>Printz</i> rule), the remainder of this Part considers arguments
for competing conceptions of federalism. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading318"></a><b>B	The normative arguments for a </b><b><i>Printz</i>
rule </b></h3>
<h4>
<a name="Heading319"></a><b><i>1	Liberty</i></b></h4>
<p>The <i>Printz</i> rule has been said to be normatively desirable for
defending a federal arrangement that acts as a guarantor of personal
liberty.<sup><a name="fnB136" href="#fn136">[135]</a></sup> This guarantor
function of federalism was raised by Kirby J in <i>New South Wales v
Commonwealth</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
This court needs to give respect to the federal character of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, for it is a liberty-enhancing feature. Federalism is a
system of government of special value and relevance in contemporary
circumstances.
It is protective of the freedom of individuals in an age when the
pressures of law, economics and technology tend to pull in the
opposite
direction.<sup><a name="fnB137" href="#fn137">[136]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
an earlier but still recent judgment, Kirby J gave further insights into his
conception of federalism as an enhancer of liberty.
He also gave an intriguing
indication that he would like to 'look afresh', perhaps with the importance of
protecting liberty in mind,
at the High Court's federalism jurisprudence:</p>
<blockquote>
the federal character of the [<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>] &#8230; divides the power of
lawmaking. The divisions are essential to the constitutional design. They are
also protective of individual
liberties and personal freedoms. Liberties and
freedoms can sometimes be endangered by the concentration of power within modern
government.
It may therefore be necessary for this Court to look afresh at its
federalism jurisprudence to ensure that it accords with the constitutional
text
and purpose.<sup><a name="fnB138" href="#fn138">[137]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>On this point it would seem that Kirby J is in the same
federalism camp as O'Connor and Scalia JJ. In <i>New York</i> the Supreme Court
proclaimed that </p>
<blockquote>
[t]he <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> does not protect the sovereignty of States for the
benefit of the States or state governments as abstract political entities
&#8230;
Rather, federalism secures to its citizens the liberties that derive
from the diffusion of sovereign
power.<sup><a name="fnB139" href="#fn139">[138]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>In
remaking the point in <i>Printz</i>, Scalia J emphasised that 'a healthy balance
of power between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of
tyranny
and abuse from either
front'.<sup><a name="fnB140" href="#fn140">[139]</a></sup></p>
<p>To the extent that one accepts the assumption that the expansion of one
government's power relative to another's also increases that
government's power
relative to individuals, the extracts immediately above contain nothing
contentious. As a normative support for
a <i>Printz</i> rule, however, the
federalism-as-liberty argument is context dependent. Federalism is structured
differently in Australia and the
United States, and federalism's claimed
function as a defender of liberty needs to be carefully examined in the context
of the Australian<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. If the protection of liberty is indeed a
function of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, does the <i>Constitution's</i> federal
structure further that objective, or some other, or both? In <i>XYZ v
Commonwealth</i>,<i> </i>Kirby J spoke of federalism's liberty-protecting effect
almost as if it were incidental to its purpose of maintaining the
'constitutional
design'. </p>
<p>A number of judges have hinted that the Australian federal structure was
designed for the benefit of persons as well as its constituent
governments. In
<i>Capital Duplicators Pty Ltd v Australian Capital Territory (No
1)</i><sup><a name="fnB141" href="#fn141">[140]</a></sup> several judges, by
holding that the people of what became an internal territory, 'no less than the
other people of the Commonwealth,
were and remain entitled to the maintenance of
the free trade area throughout the
Commonwealth',<sup><a name="fnB142" href="#fn142">[141]</a></sup> appeared to
treat certain explicitly federal provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 90</a>,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">92</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">99</a>) as being for the benefit of citizens in States (or Territories), rather
than for the States as governments. And in <i>Leeth v Commonwealth</i>, Deane
and Toohey JJ urged the High Court to look beyond the States to the
<i>Constitution's</i> other subjects: </p>
<blockquote>
The States themselves are, of course, artificial entities &#8230; It is the
people who, in a basic sense, now constitute the individual
States just as
&#8230; they constitute the Commonwealth &#8230; [I]t would be somewhat
surprising if the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, which is concerned with matters of
substance, embodied a general principle which protected the States and their
instrumentalities
from being singled out for discriminatory treatment but
provided no similar protection of the people who constitute the States and
the
Commonwealth.<sup><a name="fnB143" href="#fn143">[142]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Here
Deane and Toohey JJ adopted a conception of federalism which considers the
purpose of the federal structure to be, primarily,
to serve the people. If one
accepts that the 'concentration of power' within one government is a threat to
liberty, one could argue
that <i>Printz</i>, by resisting such concentration,
protects liberty and in doing so directs federal doctrine towards its first and
greatest purpose:
serving the people of the States and Commonwealth. This
conception emphasises the connections between the protection of liberty as
a
normative argument and the design and structure of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. Sir Anthony
Mason might recognise the argument as 'the balancing of &#8230; interests within
the framework of constitutional
principle'.<sup><a name="fnB144" href="#fn144">[143]</a></sup></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading340"></a><b><i>2	Accountability</i></b><br><a name="Heading341"></a><b><i>(a)	Political
accountability</i></b></h4>
<p>Anti-commandeering rules are said to protect 'political accountability'.
According to O'Connor J in <i>New York</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
where the Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may be state
officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval,
while the federal
officials who devised the regulatory program may remain insulated from the
electoral ramifications of their decision.
Accountability is thus diminished
when, due to federal coercion, elected state officials cannot regulate in
accordance with the views
of the local electorate in matters not pre-empted by
federal
regulations.<sup><a name="fnB145" href="#fn145">[144]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
<i>Printz</i>,<i> </i>Scalia J agreed with O'Connor J's argument and commented
that the '<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> &#8230; contemplates that a State's government will
represent and remain accountable to its own
citizens.'<sup><a name="fnB146" href="#fn146">[145]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Professor Jackson, the political accountability argument has
three aspects with regard to the commandeering of State
officers for federal
functions.<sup> </sup>Each is as applicable in Australia as the United States.
First, voters may hold State officers politically accountable for an action
that
they were forced by federal law to make. Second, voters may fail to hold the
federal government politically accountable for
those actions. Third, the federal
government may not feel itself to be accountable, particularly if the duty it
imposes on a State
official is not to be funded from federal
sources.<sup><a name="fnB147" href="#fn147">[146]</a></sup></p>
<p>The three aspects hint at the tensions inherent in the term 'federal
democracy' that were starkly exposed in the <i>Territories Senators'</i>
<i>Cases</i>, and raise a confronting normative issue: to what extent does the
Constitution's federal structure complement and conflict, respectively,
with our
democratic values? Commandeering has the potential to aggravate this normative
tension, but the strictest of anti-commandeering
rules will not remove the
tension inherent in the federal structure itself. 'If one's goal' was to make
the lines of political accountability
as straightforward as possible, 'one would
simply adopt a unitary
state.'<sup><a name="fnB148" href="#fn148">[147]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Australia, questions of political accountability must be considered within
the structure of responsible government, the constitutionally
required system of
organising the government of the
State.<sup><a name="fnB149" href="#fn149">[148]</a></sup> Graeme Hill suggests
that </p>
<blockquote>
it could be argued that responsible government requires that Commonwealth laws 
be executed by persons who are directly responsible
to the relevant Commonwealth
Minister, rather than by State officers who would be answerable to a State
Minister.<sup><a name="fnB150" href="#fn150">[149]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
High Court has indicated that it shares, to an extent, the concern for
maintaining political accountability within the federation.
In <i>Bond v The
Queen</i>, for example, the High Court asked whether 'political responsibility'
for a decision to appeal against a sentence, '(which is a decision
that can be
attended by public controversy), lie[s] with a Commonwealth or State
Minister?'<sup><a name="fnB151" href="#fn151">[150]</a></sup> However, although
responsible government may be embedded in the constitutional structure, 'it by
no means follows that a court may
invalidate legislation that, in the court's
view, dilutes the political accountability required by responsible
government.'<sup><a name="fnB152" href="#fn152">[151]</a></sup></p>
<p>Professor Winterton argues:</p>
<blockquote>
desirable though it may be that the Commonwealth Parliament should be able to
supervise the implementation of its legislation through
ministerial
responsibility, there is no justification for entrenching such notions of
political good sense in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> and invalidating legislation on
the ground that Parliament has deprived itself (by legislation which it can
repeal at any time) of
an opportunity of enforcing ministerial
responsibility.<sup><a name="fnB153" href="#fn153">[152]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Of
course, any argument from responsible government in favour of a <i>Printz</i>
rule condemns cooperative as well as conscriptive arrangements. This highlights
again the logically inconsistent treatment of voluntary
and involuntary joint
government ventures contemplated in <i>Printz</i>. The argument from responsible
government, or political accountability concerns more generally, 'proves too
much. Such an argument
seems to condemn not merely federal laws that commandeer
state or local services but also <i>voluntary</i> intergovernmental
cooperation.'<sup><a name="fnB154" href="#fn154">[153]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The High Court has demonstrated that voluntary cooperation cannot overcome
all federal constraints; the constituent governments of
the federation cannot by
agreement ignore limits imposed by the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB155" href="#fn155">[154]</a></sup> The
significant limitations of these federal constraints were made apparent in the
<i>Uniform Tax Cases</i>. If 'blurring the lines of political accountability is
somehow constitutionally
problematic,'<sup><a name="fnB156" href="#fn156">[155]</a></sup> then how are we
to explain the results of the <i>Uniform Tax Cases</i>? When the States accept
Commonwealth money to carry out projects in a manner prescribed by the
Commonwealth, all three of Professor
Jackson's aspects of the problem
potentially arise. The answer would seem to be that blurring the lines of
political accountability
is not necessarily constitutionally problematic at all.
The High Court in the <i>First Uniform Tax Case</i> seemed not to appreciate the
threat posed to political accountability by conditional grants, and indeed
expressly relied on the smooth
operation of the political process to redress
problems from which judicial review resiled. Latham CJ stated that </p>
<blockquote>
[t]he remedy for alleged abuse of power or for the use of power to promote what
are thought to be improper objects is to be found
in the political arena and not
in the
Courts.<sup><a name="fnB157" href="#fn157">[156]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Gummow
and Hayne JJ have observed that what is meant by 'responsible government'
remains unsettled, and have suggested that actors
outside the courts have role
to play in resolving the issue. In <i>Re Patterson; Ex parte
Taylor</i>,<sup><a name="fnB158" href="#fn158">[157]</a></sup> the two justices
noted that </p>
<blockquote>
[t]he content of the various principles and practices which together may be
identified in Australia as comprising 'responsible government'
is a matter of
continued debate between constitutional lawyers, political scientists and
politicians
themselves.<sup><a name="fnB159" href="#fn159">[158]</a></sup></blockquote><p>A
similarly cautious approach to the workings of responsible government was
expressed by Kirby J in <i>Austin</i>: </p>
<blockquote>
It is not the role of this Court to invalidate a new federal tax simply because
it regards some aspects of the tax unfair, unwise,
oppressive &#8230; By the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, such considerations are reserved to the Parliament
accountable to the electors &#8212; not to this
Court.<sup><a name="fnB160" href="#fn160">[159]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>To
'unfair, unwise, oppressive' might well be added 'confusing'. The political
system, it seems, must to a large extent maintain its
own accountability.</p>
<p>Political accountability appears to be a political value ill-suited to
combination with implications drawn from the federal structure
of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>. A <i>Printz</i> rule would address political accountability
concerns to a degree. However, such a rule would be inconsistent with the
treatment of
political accountability concerns in other areas. </p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading377"></a><b><i>(b)	Legal accountability</i></b></h4>
<p>As important as the question of political accountability is the question of
legal accountability: does the conferral of Commonwealth
executive functions on
State officers reduce the availability of judicial review of the exercise of
those functions? In his article
'Will the High Court <i>"Wakim"</i> Chapter II
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>?', Graeme Hill suggests that a </p>
<blockquote>
possible argument for requiring Commonwealth executive power to be exercised by
only the Commonwealth executive derives from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(v)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.
It might be argued that, as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(v)</a> guarantees the High Court jurisdiction to
grant administrative law remedies against an 'officer of the Commonwealth' and
no-one else,
this is reason to conclude that Commonwealth executive power can
only be exercised by persons who are Commonwealth
officers.<sup><a name="fnB161" href="#fn161">[160]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Again,
this accountability argument applies to cooperative arrangements as much as to
commandeering. The High Court has held that
a State officer performing
Commonwealth functions is not an 'officer of the
Commonwealth',<sup><a name="fnB162" href="#fn162">[161]</a></sup> because it is
the nature of the office, not the nature of the power, that attracts <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
75(v).</a><sup><a name="fnB163" href="#fn163">[162]</a></sup> Hill argues that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
75(v)</a> is not a convincing reason to limit executive power to Commonwealth
officers. It would be a straightforward matter, he argues, for
the Court 'to
draw an implication that judicial review was constitutionally required in
certain circumstances', such as when Commonwealth
executive power is exercised
by State officers, without relying on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(v):</a> 'on this view <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(v)</a> merely
makes clear in relation to Commonwealth officers what could be implied from the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> in any
event.'<sup><a name="fnB164" href="#fn164">[163]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A <i>Printz</i> rule, it is submitted, would be a much less effective and
more awkward manner of protecting access to judicial review than the approach
supported by Hill. Hill's approach would protect access to judicial review of
the actions of State officers exercising Commonwealth
executive power under both
cooperative and commandeering scenarios. A <i>Printz</i> rule, of course, has
nothing to do with cooperative schemes.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading386"></a><b><i>3	What is the symbolic significance of
</i></b><b>Printz<i>?</i></b></h4>
<p>Amelia Simpson makes a case for symbolism in the doctrine of State
immunity:</p>
<blockquote>
Specifically, the symbolism argument contends that in this realm surface
appearances have intrinsic importance and are not merely
indicative of matters
of substance. In other words, it contends that the <i>appearance</i> or image of
States as dignified, autonomous partners in the federal compact is a matter of
constitutional concern, aside from and
in addition to the substantive actuality
of that
autonomy.<sup><a name="fnB165" href="#fn165">[164]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Maintaining
the 'dignified, autonomous' image of the States is said to be </p>
<blockquote>
essential to securing the goodwill between governments that is necessary to the
cohesion and stability of a federal system of government.
Put simply, it may be
impossible to secure State constitutional autonomy and integrity as a matter of
substantive effect without
also securing that autonomy and integrity as a matter
of surface impression.<sup><a name="fnB166" href="#fn166">[165]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>Symbolism is thus linked to substance; by symbolism is meant a
'synergy' between appearance and
actuality.<sup><a name="fnB167" href="#fn167">[166]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bright-line rules are likely to have a more powerful symbolic dimension than
'amorphous tests'.<sup><a name="fnB168" href="#fn168">[167]</a></sup> A
<i>Printz</i> rule would make a powerful symbolic statement: a rule that the
Commonwealth could never in any way or under any circumstances commandeer
State
officers for a federal purpose would reaffirm the autonomy of the States. To the
extent that a dignified and autonomous image
of the States is inherently a good
thing, the symbolic dimension of a <i>Printz</i> rule is a normative argument in
favour of its adoption. However, if the discursive steps laid out by Simpson are
followed, it would
appear to be a symbolism whose value is limited to exactly
that: as a symbol, disconnected from 'actuality'. There can be no reliable
evidence that anti-commandeering doctrines promote the 'goodwill' between
governments necessary for 'cohesion and stability', as
it is unclear what this
evidence would be and what it would prove. 'Cohesion and stability' would surely
be in the eye of the governmental
beholder: the States might argue that
stability of their administrations is served by protecting their officers from a
marauding
Commonwealth; the Commonwealth might argue that national stability is
undermined by its inability to use State officers to execute
its programs.</p>
<p>Professor Tribe predicted that the rule announced in <i>Printz</i> was
unlikely to serve more than a formal or symbolic function in preserving State
autonomy. Similar conditions to those in Australia
&#8212; the central
government's superior revenue raising capacity and the power to make conditional
grants &#8212; as well as the
ease of circumventing the rule through laws of
general application (later demonstrated in <i>Reno v
Condon</i><sup><a name="fnB169" href="#fn169">[168]</a></sup>) all conspired to
'question the importance of the bright-line rule the [Supreme] Court sought to
vindicate in <i>Printz</i>.'<sup><a name="fnB170" href="#fn170">[169]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>A <i>Printz </i>rule in Australia would symbolise the adoption by the High
Court of a strong version of the coordinate conception of dual federalism.
It
does not follow, however, that a practical change in the workings of the
federation would be effected by the appearance of this
symbol in the federalism
discourse.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading401"></a><b><i>4	Doctrinal certainty, workable flexibility and
the rule of law</i></b></h4>
<p>Potentially over-inclusive bright-line rules 'may, in spite of their inherent
inflexibility, be valued for their propensity to generate
doctrinal certainty
and stability.'<sup><a name="fnB171" href="#fn171">[170]</a></sup> Doctrinal
certainty 'sends relatively clear signals to political
actors'<sup><a name="fnB172" href="#fn172">[171]</a></sup> and is valued for its
contribution to the rule of law. Clearly defined rules and easily identifiable
parameters promote consistency
in adjudication and send clear signals to
legislators as to what is and is not permissible. A <i>Printz</i> rule would
bring a degree of certainty to a doctrine that has become more uncertain and
amorphous in the wake of <i>Austin</i>. <i>Austin</i> made no contribution to
the efforts of recent cases, such as <i>AEU</i>, to set clear guidelines around
the limits of the doctrine of State immunities. Indeed, by demoting the function
of discrimination
as an indicator of constitutional impairment in <i>Austin</i>,
the High Court reversed the trend to greater certainty in the doctrine. </p>
<p>However, the quality of the certainty provided by the cases decided before
<i>Austin</i> warrants scrutiny. The certainty brought by rigid rules is,
according to one argument, 'illusory' because the presence of rules hides
the
discretion available to
judges.<sup><a name="fnB173" href="#fn173">[172]</a></sup> Judges retain, for
example, the discretion to decide whether or not a particular State employee
falls within the open category of
constitutionally protected employees
established in <i>AEU</i>. Certainty is not the only state of development in
which a constitutional doctrine can meet the requirements imposed by the rule
of
law. Flexibility, a value at odds with certainty, can serve the rule of law by
avoiding the problem of over-inclusiveness and
consequently maintaining the
stability and durability of legal frameworks. Flexible standards possess the
normative quality of workability.
By mandating a case-by-case approach to the
issues, flexible standards preserve the functionality of constitutional
doctrines. </p>
<p>Workability was a core concern of Stevens J in his dissenting opinion in
<i>Printz</i>. If the federal government was prohibited from conscripting State
officers, Stevens J argued it would be not only be unable to respond
in a timely
way to the 'epidemic of gun
violence'<sup><a name="fnB174" href="#fn174">[173]</a></sup> to which the
<i>Brady Act </i>was addressed, it would be prevented, for example, from
requiring State employees to register young adults for the draft in the event
of
a military emergency.<sup><a name="fnB175" href="#fn175">[174]</a></sup></p>
<p>Flexibility and certainty are opposing values, each of which can serve the
rule of law in the appropriate instance. When it comes
to assessing the
normative arguments for federal constraints, 'the demands of federalism do not
lend themselves to decontextualised,
formalist rulemaking by
courts.'<sup><a name="fnB176" href="#fn176">[175]</a></sup> Flexibility has
advantages over certainty; <i>Austin</i> formulates the doctrine of State
immunity at an appropriate level of abstraction, and the <i>Printz</i> rule's
normative benefits of certainty are inadequate to outweigh the normative
imperative of workability, and the desirability of
avoiding
over-inclusiveness.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading412"></a><b><i>5	Conceptualising State powers as property:
Implications for commandeering</i></b></h4>
<p>Hills conceptualises the anti-commandeering rules in <i>New York</i> and
<i>Printz</i> as an 'entitlement to state governments that is protected by a
property rule'.<sup><a name="fnB177" href="#fn177">[176]</a></sup> The
entitlement is said to be necessary to adequately maintain the level of
incentives required to run the public administration
efficiently.<sup><a name="fnB178" href="#fn178">[177]</a></sup> 'It is logical',
Hills states, 'to infer that such erosion of the power, money and prestige of
nonfederal offices can only reduce
the incentive' of citizens to involve
themselves in State politics, as 'federal commandeering would reduce the
marginal incentive
to invest [that is, involve oneself] in the burdened activity
[the administration of the
State].'<sup><a name="fnB179" href="#fn179">[178]</a></sup></p>
<p>This argument extends an entertaining analogy into insupportable supposition.
Hills provides no evidence for the proposition that
federal commandeering
dissuades political aspirants from State politics. The 'incentive issue' is
reminiscent of <i>Austin</i>, and ought to be assessed on a case-by-case basis
as it was in that case: that is, by asking whether the burden in question can be
said to amount to a real disincentive to take office. That is an inherently
imprecise exercise, as the differences in the separate
findings of the joint
judgment and Kirby J in <i>Austin </i>demonstrate. Furthermore, as Kirby J
appreciated in <i>Austin</i>, the incentives motivating people to seek public
office cannot be adequately conceptualised by
economics.<sup><a name="fnB180" href="#fn180">[179]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the main dissenting opinion in <i>Printz</i>, Stevens J made a compelling
point arguing in the opposite direction; that is, that commandeering is in fact
an efficient and rational
policy in response to the nature of certain
challenges. If a State has the personnel and infrastructure already in place,
Stevens
J suggests it is an inefficient waste of resources for the federal
government to build an alternative service providing network from
the ground up:
</p>
<blockquote>
By limiting the ability of the Federal Government to enlist state officials in
the implementation of its programs, the Court creates
incentives for the
National Government to aggrandize itself. In the name of States' rights, the
majority would have the Federal Government
create vast national bureaucracies to
implement its policies.<sup><a name="fnB181" href="#fn181">[180]</a></sup>
</blockquote><p>Although every situation will turn on it own facts, it can be
seen how, according to this analysis, some judicious conscripting of
State
officers for federal functions may be both more efficient and,
'perversely',<sup><a name="fnB182" href="#fn182">[181]</a></sup> more
federalism-friendly.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading424"></a><b>C	The normative arguments are inconclusive</b></h3>
<p>Text and structure reasoning, when employed as a stand alone analytical
method, is unable to engage with the full range of normative
benefits and
disadvantages delivered by a bright-line rule prohibiting the commandeering of
State officers for Commonwealth purposes.
Addressing the normative arguments
directly removes the risk of unacknowledged assumptions informing abstract
judgments about what
is and is not 'logically and practically necessary for the
preservation' of the federal structure. In this case, however, the normative
arguments are not unequivocal. The liberty argument is arguably supportive of a
<i>Printz</i> rule; the other arguments are subject to an array of caveats. The
normative arguments are therefore insufficient to rebut the presumption
against
a <i>Printz</i> rule created by its inherent over-inclusiveness.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading426"></a><b>CONCLUSION</b></h2>
<p>In the last 15 years, the US Supreme Court has driven a 'federalism
revolution'.<sup><a name="fnB183" href="#fn183">[182]</a></sup> This article
takes an important principle of the revolution, the strict rule prohibiting the
commandeering of State officers for
federal purposes, and considers the
arguments for its application in the context of the more stable Australian
version of the doctrine
of State immunity. </p>
<p>The High Court's preferred method of text and structure reasoning provides
little support for the rule. The (controversial) concept
of necessity defeats
the arguments in favour of the <i>Printz</i> rule, as it cannot be demonstrated
that a categorical bright-line anti-commandeering rule would add to the
protection afforded the
federal structure of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> by the test in
<i>Austin</i>. Indeed, the over-inclusive implications of a <i>Printz</i> rule
would extend its protection beyond the necessary.</p>
<p>Text and structure reasoning alone provides an inadequate framework for
evaluating the suitability of a <i>Printz</i> rule, as the concept of necessity
may mask a range of normative decisions. Of the main normative arguments
advanced on behalf of
<i>Printz</i>, modified for the Australian context,
considerations of liberty are most strongly in its favour; political
accountability, symbolism,
certainty, and efficiency are less conclusive upon
close consideration.</p>
<p>Equivocal as they are, the normative arguments provide no overwhelming reason
to conclude that, regardless of its over-inclusiveness,
a <i>Printz</i> rule
would be normatively desirable. Being neither uncontentiously necessary nor
decisively desirable in the Australian context,
<i>Printz</i> should remain in
the United States.</p>
<p>Breyer J devotes much of his short dissenting opinion in <i>Printz</i> to
discussing the utility of comparative federalism:</p>
<blockquote>
the United States is not the only nation that seeks to reconcile the practical
need for a central authority with the democratic virtues
of more local control
&#8230; Of course, we are interpreting our own <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>, not those of
other nations, and there may be relevant political and structural differences
&#8230; But their experience may nonetheless
cast an empirical light on the
consequences of different solutions to a common legal
problem.<sup><a name="fnB184" href="#fn184">[183]</a></sup></blockquote><p>We
can learn from the American experience of anti-commandeering, but there is no
place in Australia for an adapted version. </p>

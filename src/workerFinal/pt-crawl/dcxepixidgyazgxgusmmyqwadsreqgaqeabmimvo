<h3>Program of Study</h3>




<p>The BA program in the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine (HIPS) is designed for College students interested in studying science in terms of its historical development, conceptual structure, and social role. Students in the program must do sufficient work in one or more sciences to acquire a sound foundation for studying the nature of science. After securing this basis, they are expected to gain an understanding of how science arose, as well as how the content of scientific thought has changed and is changing, because of both its own internal dynamic and its interaction with the larger society in which it is embedded.</p>




<p>The HIPS program is designed to make possible the study of a wide range of social, historical, and conceptual issues relating to science. Students completing the program follow a number of different careers. Some pursue graduate study in the history and philosophy of science or in some field of science. Others find the program valuable preparation for the study of medicine, law, public policy, or science journalism. More generally, the goal of the program is to provide students with a sound basis on which to interpret and evaluate science and science policy. Some students choose to construct a degree program combining the requirements for the HIPS major with those for a major in the physical or biological sciences. Others, having met the HIPS program requirements, use electives to broaden their liberal arts education.</p>




<p>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in HIPS. Information follows the description of the major.</p>




<h4>HIPS Sponsor</h4>




<p>The Morris Fishbein Center for the History of Science and Medicine sponsors the HIPS program. Further information can be obtained in the center's office (SS 207) and at <a href="https://fishbein.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">fishbein.uchicago.edu</a>.</p>




<a name="programrequirements"></a>
<h3>Program Requirements</h3>




<p><strong>Elements of the Curriculum.</strong> The curriculum of the program contains five principal elements:</p>




<p><strong>1. The Foundation.</strong> All students must:</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px">a. complete an approved sequence that fulfills the biological sciences general education requirement;</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px">b. complete the general education requirement in the physical sciences with a physics sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PHYS%2012100-12200" title="PHYS 12100-12200" class="bubblelink seq2code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PHYS 12100-12200');">PHYS 12100-12200</a> General Physics I-II</span> or equivalent) or a chemistry sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CHEM%2011100-11200" title="CHEM 11100-11200" class="bubblelink seq2code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CHEM 11100-11200');">CHEM 11100-11200</a> Comprehensive General Chemistry I-II</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CHEM%2010100" title="CHEM 10100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CHEM 10100');">CHEM 10100</a> Introductory General Chemistry I</span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CHEM%2010200" title="CHEM 10200" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CHEM 10200');">CHEM 10200</a> Introductory General Chemistry II</span>, or equivalent), or have earned a score of 5 on the AP Chemistry or Physics test or a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Physics C Mechanics and E&amp;M test;</p>





<p style="margin-left:40px">c. complete a calculus sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2013100-13200" title="MATH 13100-13200" class="bubblelink seq2code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 13100-13200');">MATH 13100-13200</a> Elementary Functions and Calculus I-II</span> or higher), or have earned a score of 5 on the AP Calculus BC test;</p>





<p style="margin-left:40px">d. complete three courses on the origins and development of science in the West: one course in each of the following three chronological periods: ancient, early modern, and modern.</p>




<p><strong>2. Advanced Science.</strong> In addition to the science courses typically taken as part of the general education requirements, students are expected to take three courses in science, social sciences, or mathematics beyond the introductory level. They select these advanced courses according to their special aims, their area of concentration, and the subject of their bachelor's thesis.</p>




<p><strong>3. Areas of Concentration.</strong> All students in the program determine an area of concentration in the anthropology, ethics, history, philosophy, or sociology of science and medicine. In consultation with the program director and their program adviser, students select five courses to constitute this concentration area. For example, some students may be particularly interested in the intellectual and social interactions between changing scientific knowledge and institutions, on the one hand, and evolving social institutions, on the other; a second group may be concerned with either epistemological issues related to the growth of science or moral and political problems attending the employment of technology; and a third group may wish to emphasize the study of science as a social or cultural activity.</p>




<p><strong>4. Tutorials.</strong> Students are required to take two tutorial courses; this is typically done early in their program. With a specific focus that changes each year, these tutorials are small classes (from three to ten students) that emphasize discussion and writing. An updated list of courses is available on the <a href="https://fishbein.uchicago.edu">Fishbein Center website</a><a href="fishbein.uchicago.edu"> </a>or at <a href="http://registrar.uchicago.edu/classes">registrar.uchicago.edu/classes</a>.</p>




<p><strong>5. Bachelor's Thesis and Junior Seminar.</strong> Third-year students enroll in a designated one-quarter seminar (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HIPS%2029800" title="HIPS 29800" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HIPS 29800');">HIPS 29800</a> Junior Seminar: My Favorite Readings in the History and Philosophy of Science</span>) that deals with general aspects of history, philosophy, and social studies of science and medicine. In Spring Quarter of their third year, students must discuss their proposal for their bachelor's thesis with the program director. In consultation with the program director, students then sign up for a reading and research course (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HIPS%2029700" title="HIPS 29700" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HIPS 29700');">HIPS 29700</a> Readings and Research in History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine</span>) with an appropriate faculty member. In their fourth year, this research course should lead to a bachelor's thesis (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HIPS%2029900" title="HIPS 29900" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HIPS 29900');">HIPS 29900</a> Bachelor's Thesis</span>) that integrates each student's academic studies, bringing them to bear on a significant question related to some historical, conceptual, ethical, or social aspect of science. Fourth-year students also enroll in a two-quarter <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HIPS%2029810" title="HIPS 29810" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HIPS 29810');">HIPS 29810</a> Bachelor's Thesis Workshop</span>, which is comprised of meetings that focus on organizing, researching, writing, and revising the thesis.</p>

<a name="admission"></a>
<h3>Admission</h3>




<p>To be eligible for admission, students should have completed at least two of the four foundation course sequences listed in the preceding section and should have maintained a 3.2 GPA or higher in previous course work. Students should apply for admission no later than Autumn Quarter of their third year to the director of the program. The director advises students about the requirements, arranges a preliminary plan of study, and discusses scheduling conflicts and special cases. Thereafter, a student chooses, in consultation with the director, a BA adviser from the staff.</p>




<a name="honors"></a>
<h3>Honors</h3>




<p>Students who meet the following criteria are considered for graduation with honors: (1) overall GPA of 3.3 or higher, (2) completion of a bachelor's thesis of A quality, and (3) a majority vote by the faculty in favor of honors.</p>




<a name="grading"></a>
<h3>Grading</h3>




<p>Students majoring in HIPS must receive quality grades in all courses meeting the requirements of the degree program, except <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HIPS%2029810" title="HIPS 29810" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HIPS 29810');">HIPS 29810</a> Bachelor's Thesis Workshop</span>, which must be taken for Pass/Fail grading. Nonmajors may take courses for Pass/Fail grading with consent of instructor.</p>





<a name="advisers"></a>
<h3>Advisers</h3>




<p>Drawn from many parts of the University, those listed in the Faculty Section of the HIPS program have direct responsibility for admitting students, formulating curriculum, and advising students.</p>




<a name="minorprograminhistoryphilosophyandsocialstudiesofscienceandmedicine"></a>
<h3>Minor Program in History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine</h3>




<p>Students in other fields of study may complete a minor in HIPS, which offers students who are majoring in science the opportunity to gain an understanding of the conceptual, historical, and social contexts in which their disciplines are situated.</p>




<p>The minor requires a total of six courses. Courses in the minor (1) may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors and (2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers.</p>




<p>Students should take at least two courses focusing on the origins and development of science in the West (one course in each of two of the following chronological periods: ancient, early modern, and modern) to meet the general education requirement in civilization studies. Additional courses in these sequences that are not used to meet the general education requirement can count toward courses required for the minor.</p>




<p>Students must complete one tutorial course.</p>




<p>The remaining five courses for the minor program should constitute an area of concentration in the anthropology, ethics, history, philosophy, or sociology of science and medicine. Students select the courses that constitute this concentration in consultation with the program director and their program adviser.</p>




<p>Students who elect the minor program in HIPS should meet with the program director before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the program. The director's approval for the minor program should be submitted to the student's College adviser by the deadline above on the <a href="https://humanities-web.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/college-prod/s3fs-public/documents/Consent_Minor_Program.pdf">Consent to Complete a Minor Program</a> form obtained from the College adviser or online.</p>

Along the way, we explore how the fantasy and reality of computation historically reflected human and organizational capacities, designed as prosthetics to extend calculation and control. We further consider how computers and computational models have come to influence and transform 20th and 21st Century politics, economics, science, and society. Finally, we examine the influence of computers and AI on imagination, structuring the utopias and dystopias through which we view the future. Students will read original texts and commentary, manipulate analog and digital hardware, software, networks and AI, and contribute to Wikipedia on the history and the social and cultural implications of computing.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>HIPS 15005.  Engineered Environments in East Asia.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
Environments in East Asia have drastically changed in the twentieth century. Seawalls and cities rose in coastal areas that were previously untouched along Japan's coast; cement-dams replaced dirt dikes that divided the Han river in the Korean Peninsula; and railroads expanded into far-off regions in China, redefining both cities and hinterlands. These are three archetypal examples of technically complex projects that this course will explore. These industrial and technological projects of a national, regional, or global scale connect past to present and pose questions to our future about climate change, public health crises, and energy anxieties. This class asks what engineered environments are and how they shape our everyday life.
We will visit three types of archetypal megaprojects-the railway system, the transformation of ocean space, and the building of dams--in China, Japan, and Korea that have shaped and continue to shape the environments of East Asia, an economically vibrant, politically challenging, and ecologically diverse region, with a deep history and vibrant technological innovations even today. We will discuss the politics and science behind the building of each megaproject, the interconnected history among them, and more importantly, how each project generated its environment, shaped the relationship between human societies and nature, and influences our current understanding of the region.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">
Instructor(s): Y. Dong<br/>
Note(s): All the course materials are in English. In this course, we will engage with primary documents that are translated into English and other scholarship on specific sites, including newspaper reports, journal articles, and documentaries. Primary sources include literature, memoirs, and visual images.  For students who do not have background knowledge on the political and social history of East Asia, this course also assigns readings from historical textbooks to help students place megaprojects in each’s historical context. There are no prerequisites for this course. There will be a component of short lectures in some meetings.  <br/>

The crisis of nature and technology is at the heart of the 21st century mode of production as unprecedented planetary scale ecological destruction, climate change, and exhaustion of fossil fuels undercut the dynamics of capitalist accumulation. At the same time, novel techno-natural fixes are being designed to contain the crises immanent to the life process of capital.  However, these movements are far from seamless; new tensions, contradictions, and horizons of struggles emerge making a critical inquiry of these concepts urgent to Anthropological thinking. In this course, the students will be introduced to foundational approaches to these problems.  
The first half of the course will intensively engage with dialectical materialist frameworks to understand the interrelationship between nature, technology, and consciousness in the capitalist mode of production. From this engagement, we will derive critical concepts that will be used to engage with the pertinent questions of planetary scale appropriation of human, non-human and more-than-human life in emergent anthropological theory and ethnographic literature. In doing so, our goal is to reflect on a series of questions: What is the place of nature and technology in the capitalist mode of production? How and if they embody limits to the workings of capital? How does anthropology allow us to develop new political and theoretical horizons that emerge in the wake of these developments?</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course examines the category of race in African history from the nineteenth century to the contemporary era. It references the legacies of earlier identity constructions in the creation of these categories, as well as analyzing its transnational and trans-imperial dimensions.  
The class combines intellectual, cultural, and social history to illuminate the actors, encounters, and debates animating this dynamic field of study-moving beyond assumptions of African societies as spaces of ethnic-and not racialized-identities to examine the construction of difference through transnational history of science, gender and sexuality studies, histories of slavery, Middle Eastern colonial projects, as well as the invention of the category of &quot;native&quot; in European colonial discourse. Are categories of differences primarily due to European colonialism, as many claim? Or are they embedded in a more complex configuration coming from settler colonial projects, national liberation struggles, and postcolonial nativist discourses? 
Students examine case studies from across the continent-from Ghana to Sudan to South Africa-paying close attention to experiences of Asian, Arab, and mixed-race peoples navigating colonial and postcolonial African states; while keeping an eye on how debates about difference, diaspora, and nationalism in North America and Europe inform discussions of race in Africa, and how Africans shape discourses of race in colonial metropoles and the United States.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course examines the complex issues surrounding the body, disability, and medical care in antiquity. It will be guided by a variety of questions, such as what was the root cause of bodily infirmity and disease in antiquity? How did cultural views of sex, gender, and race influence perceptions of the body and what it meant to be able bodied? Such questions are significant when considering what kind of access to healthcare marginalized groups had. In order to explore these questions, we will examine ancient Mediterranean views of medical care through material remains (e.g., magical amulets and healing shrines) and textual evidence (e.g., Galen and Hippocrates). After considering this wider cultural context, we will examine treatments in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and early Christianity. We will also explore how Christian concepts of medical care evolved in light of accounts of Jesus as a divine healer. In addition to this ancient evidence, we will engage with modern disability studies and sociological analyses to better orient our readings. At the end of the course, students will be better acquainted with the complex relationship between religion and medicine and how that affects modern healthcare decisions.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

To help us with these questions, we will focus on 20th-century analytic work (by Putnam, Nagel, Searle, Jackson, Dennett, Chalmers, Block, Dretske, and others), but we will also read important historical texts on the nature of the mind by Aristotle, Descartes, and Hume.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>HIPS 20574.  How to Think Sociologically.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
This course tackles the &quot;big problem&quot; of low sociological literacy. When faced with the problems of the world, people usually resort to economic, biological, or ideological explanations. They cite self-interest, genetically encoded drives, or some pre-given understanding of how the world works. The price of such simple frameworks is an impoverished view of the world, a lack of understanding and empathy, and a predisposition to orthodoxy or ideology. In this sense, low sociological literacy is a big problem in the world today. This course was developed in the belief that the capacity to think sociologically-that is, to understand people as socially embedded, or shaped by the situations in which they find themselves-can enrich our understanding of the world immeasurably. It can give us analytical purchase on a number of social problems, including poverty; social inequality; racial, class, and gender discrimination; urban segregation; populism and political polarization; and organizational wrongdoing (we'll discuss each of these topics in class). A sociological perspective can also transform how we engage with the world, promoting an ethics of understanding and empathy--as opposed to the ethics apparently prevalent today: judging people and insisting they change.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Society rearranges itself, though we don't always know where it is heading. When the postmodern moment had arrived in the 1980s it perplexed social theorists, hence its characterization as simply a &quot;post&quot;-stage of modernity. Digitization is one answer to the question of direction of change in the last decades.  In this class, we take the ongoing transformations that we attribute to digital media as a starting point to ask what challenges they provide to social theory that may force us to reconsider some of our most basic concepts and premises. We will understand the term digital age broadly to refer to the rise of algorithms, sensors, (big) data, machine learning, and computational methods, all developments that swirl in and around the Artificial Intelligence scene and intersect with and replace purely human relations. The class gives particular attention to concepts such as action and interaction, embodiment, social situations, subjectivity and autonomy, as wells as society as communication.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course uses the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie as a case study to understand the environmental and cultural challenges of ecological restoration. In essence, we will look at the Midewin as an environmental humanities problem, asking the questions: What does it mean to restore a landscape or an ecosystem? What values or biases are in place in ecological restoration and how do we overcome them? The Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, managed by the US Forest Service, is a restored prairie on the former site of the WII era Joliet Army Ammunition Plant. Throughout the September Term, we will visit the site several times to meet with Forest Service employees, participate in environmental restoration work, collect data for ecological studies, and learn more about the complicated history of the prairie and efforts to restore it.

In 2014, the Vatican Radio made a splash when it reported that the pontiff, Pope Francis, condoned the baptism of extraterrestrials-if they so desired it. &quot;Who are we to close doors?&quot; he asked rhetorically. It was both a metaphor for spiritual inclusion and an accurate representation of the modern Vatican's position on the possibilities of modern astrobiology and the search for extrasolar planets, fields whose rapid growth over the past two decades make serious consideration of extraterrestrial life seem like a uniquely modern phenomena. Its history, however, is in fact many centuries old. In this course we will examine the development of beliefs concerning life in the universe from the sixteenth century to the present. How did historical actors understand the nature, abilities, and location of extraterrestrial life, and its relationship to man and god? We will analyze connections between these beliefs and contemporary political, social, scientific, and religious developments. These include the role of the plurality of worlds in the debates over heliocentrism, its impact and application in the context of deism and social and political freethought, its literary and artistic depictions and use as a tool of satire and social commentary, its influence on natural philosophy, its decline and the subsequent rise of alien conspiracists and their critics, and how and why conceptions of the extraplanetary other took a dark and sinister turn toward the early-to-mid twentieth century.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

In this class, we examine the politics of scientific and technical knowledge in Africa with a focus on colonialism and its aftermath. How have different people produced and used knowledge about the environment, medicine, and technology? What kinds of knowledge count as indigenous and who gets credit for innovation?

Climate change is not just an urgent environmental crisis for scientists, engineers, and policy makers: it is a moral problem that also informs individual and intimate aspects of human life, including choices about reproduction and parenting. For example, a 2018 survey published in the New York Times found that young adults in the U.S. are having fewer children than they would otherwise prefer, in part due to concerns about climate change and overpopulation. In this course, we examine the moral dimensions of having and raising children in an era shaped by climate change, looking closely at two main questions: 1) Is it ethical to have children in light of the world that the next generation will inherit, which may include more extreme weather events, unvoluntary human migrations, diminished access to resources, and heightened insecurity? 2) Is it ethical to have children in the context of the affluent West, where consumptive human populations disproportionately contribute to the effects of climate change that impact the world's most vulnerable? We will examine various points of view on these questions, engaging material from the disciplines of environmental studies and ethics, science and technology studies, and religious and philosophical ethics. Responses from feminist, queer, Indigenous, Black, and religiously diverse authors (and intersections therein) will shape our course readings and discussions.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This is a lecture and discussion class that will explore how a variety of philosophic and religious thinkers approach the issues and problems of modern dilemmas in medicine and science in a field called bioethics.  We will consider a general argument for your consideration: that the arguments and the practices from faith traditions and from philosophy offer significant contributions that underlie policies and practices in bioethics.  
We will use a case-based method to study how different traditions describe and defend differences in moral choices in contemporary bioethics.  This class is based on the understanding that case narratives serve as another core text for the discipline of bioethics and that complex ethical issues are best considered by a careful examination of the competing theories as work themselves out in specific cases.   We will examine both classic cases that have shaped our understanding of the field of bioethics and cases that are newly emerging, including the case of research done at our University.  Through these cases, we will ask how religious traditions both collide and cohere over such topics as embryo research, health care reform, terminal illness, issues in epidemics and public health, and our central research question, synthetic biology research.
This class will also explore how the discipline of bioethics has emerged to reflect upon such dilemmas, with particular attention to the role that theology and philosophy have played in such reflection.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Buddhism is the only religion able to cope with modern scientific needs.&quot; This quotation, often erroneously attributed to Albert Einstein, prompts the question: Why are such statements about Buddhism so easily taken nowadays as credible and plausible? Currently, it seems no other religion is held as compatible with science as Buddhism: From the recent 'mindfulness' craze in psychology and medicine, to the 'Emptiness' of quantum physics, Buddhism is uniquely hailed as a 'rational religion' whose insights anticipated modern science by millennia. Some even suggest it is not a 'religion' at all, but rather a sort of 'mind-science.' This course functions as both an introduction to Buddhism and a critical survey of its modern scientific reception. As we explore Buddhism's relationship to contemporary scientific theories in psychology and physics, we will be guided by questions such as: What methodological principles distinguish the practices of religion and science? What are the different ways they can be brought into relation? Why is Buddhism, in particular, singled out as uniquely scientific? What modern historical factors, like colonialism and secularization, contribute to this contemporary meme? Why does it matter whether Buddhism is compatible with science or not? What, exactly, is at stake in this relationship? And for whom? No prior study of Buddhism or the philosophy of science is expected.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Since Foucault's groundbreaking work on the History of Sexuality, we have become attuned to the effects of power and the political implications of the science of sexuality. While Foucault's text has offered a critical avenue to examine the secular state's administrations of sexuality, it begins with Christianity's techniques of power based on the confession of one's sex. The Christian formulation of the relationship between 'sex' and 'sin' is essential to understanding the techniques of power that connect sexuality, legality, criminality, normality, and transgression in modern secular contexts. In this class, we will begin with the critical questions of the History of Sexuality, then turn to primary texts in order to examine the way 'sex' and 'sin' became conceptually connected in Christianity, and finally interrogate the effects of this relation for medieval and modern politics. Over the course of these readings, we will trace the relation between the concepts and their effects to discern the histories of sexuality that lie at the root of contemporary debates on freedom, power, resistance, and desire.

In this course we will explore the notion that literary fiction can contribute to the generation of new knowledge of the human mind, human behavior, and human societies. Some novelists in the late 19th and early 20th century provided fictional portrayals of human nature that were grounded into Darwinian theory. These novelists operated within the conceptual framework of the complementarity of science and literature advanced by Goethe and the other romantics. At a time when novels became highly introspective and psychological, these writers used their literary craftsmanship to explore and illustrate universals aspects of human nature. In this course we read the work of several novelists such as George Eliot, HG Wells, Joseph Conrad, Jack London, Yuvgeny Zamyatin, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Italo Svevo, and Elias Canetti, and discuss how these authors anticipated the discoveries made decades later by cognitive, social, and evolutionary psychology.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

With the emergence of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney, the production of computer-generated content has become accessible to a wide range of users and use cases. Knowledge institutions are particularly challenged to find adequate responses to changing notions of authorship as the mainstreaming of 'artificial' texts, audio-visual artifacts, and code is transforming our paradigms of communication in real-time.

Worrying about what's normal and what's not is an endemic feature of both our popular and scientific cultures. Is my intelligence above average? What about my height? Should I be feeling this way? Is there a pill for that? People seem to have always been concerned with fitting in, but the way of describing the general run of practices and conditions as &quot;normal&quot; is a rather recent phenomenon; testament to the vast influence of the modern human sciences on how we understand ourselves and others. This seminar will offer a broad historical overview of the ways that group behaviors and individual traits - bodily, moral, intellectual - were methodically described and measured in the past 200 years. We will become acquainted with the work of sociologists and anthropologists, psychiatrists and psychologists, polling experts and child development specialists, and ask about the kinds of people their efforts brought into being, from sexual perverts to the chronically depressed. The course will focus on the scientific theories and techniques used to distinguish the normal from the pathological, together with the new social institutions that translated this knowledge into forms of control. We will read Émile Durkheim on suicide rates and Cesare Lombroso on born criminals; learn about IQ tests and developmental milestones; and consider whether, with the advent of personalized medicine and self-data, we have indeed reached the &quot;end of average.&quot;</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

From models and measures to imaging technologies and genomic sequencing, technologies have profoundly shaped how we know and understand human bodies, health, and disease. Drawing on foundational and contemporary science and technology studies scholarship, this class will interrogate technologies of the body: how they are made, the ways in which they have changed understandings of the human condition, their impact on individual and collective identities, and the interests and values built into their very design. Course readings will examine how technologies render bodies knowable and also construct them in particular ways. We will also focus on how technologies incorporate, and reinforce, ideas about human difference. Students will conduct an independent, quarter-long research project analyzing a biomedical technology of their choice. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify and explain the social, political and economic factors that shape the design and production of biomedical technologies, as well as the impact of these technologies on biomedicine and the social world more broadly.

What do comics add to the discourse on dying and death? What insights do comics provide about the experience of dying, death, caregiving, grieving, and memorialization? Can comics help us better understand our own wishes about the end of life? This is an interactive course designed to introduce students to the field of graphic medicine and explore how comics can be used as a mode of scholarly investigation into issues related to dying, death, and the end of life. The framework for this course intends to balance readings and discussion with creative drawing and comics-making assignments. The work will provoke personal inquiry and self-reflection and promote understanding of a range of topics relating to the end of life, including examining how we die, defining death, euthanasia, rituals around dying and death, and grieving. The readings will primarily be drawn from a wide variety of graphic memoirs and comics, but will be supplemented with materials from a variety of multimedia sources including the biomedical literature, philosophy, cinema, podcasts, and the visual arts.

In American public discourse, it is common to hear abortion referred to as a &quot;religious issue.&quot; But is abortion a religious issue? If so, in what ways, to whom, and since when? 
In this course we will answer these questions by tracing the relationship between religion and abortion in American history. We will examine the kinds of claims religious groups have made about abortion; how religion has shaped the development of medical, legal, economic, and cultural perspectives on the topic; how debates over abortion have led to the rise of a certain kind of religious politics in the United States; and how issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and the body are implicated in this conversation. Although the course will cover a range of time periods, religious traditions, and types of data (abortion records from Puritan New England, enslaved people's use of root medicine to induce miscarriage, and Jewish considerations of the personhood of the fetus, among others), we will give particular attention to the significance of Christianity in legal and political debates about abortion in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. 
There are no prerequisites for this course and no background in Religious Studies is required. However, this course may be particularly well-suited to students interested in thinking about how their areas of study (medicine and medical sciences, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, political science) converge with religion and Religious Studies.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

For centuries the &quot;Jewish doctor&quot; has existed as an archetype, but is there such a thing as Jewish medicine? Does Judaism teach a distinct approach to the body, illness, and healing? And more significantly, why should religion have anything to do with one's health today? In this course we will grapple with our assumptions regarding modern Western medicine by discussing topics in Jewish medical thought and ethics. We will study how Judaism - its texts, history, laws, and traditions - intersect with issues of science, medicine, and the body. In particular we will think about how a Jewish approach to medicine, and more broadly a religious approach, might complicate contemporary assumptions about the body and healing. We will also consider how Jewish bodies have been imagined and stereotyped, and think about how that might affect Jewish approaches to disease and medical ethics. This course will thus offer students a way to think about alternatives to assumptions about medicine, the body, and ethics in the secular West, which will be explored both in class materials and in personal projects.

Through a survey of innovative medical authorities and religious reformers, students will investigate the co-constitution of two bodies of knowledge at a historical moment (the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries) when questions of authority and epistemology are in considerable flux. This period has long been implicated in the &quot;conflict thesis&quot;-a hugely influential argument that portrays the centuries-long relationship between religion and science/medicine as an inherently adversarial one. This course shall scrutinize that argument through a discussion of seemingly contradictory examples where reformers that touted the all-encompassing reach of divine providence also promoted intricate public health infrastructures; where the Vatican increasingly relied on university-trained physicians to validate saints and their miracles; where theologians were viewed as authorities on Galen and responsible for medical breakthroughs; and where medicine and metaphysics were considered complementary pursuits. Ultimately, students will unveil a portrait not of conflict, but of a symbiotic relationship between religion and medicine. The goal of our course will then be to query why religious reformers were not only unthreatened by but also actively esteemed the medical arts as a valuable ally.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

At once sinful and reverential, a site of magic and science, rational and irrational, Babylon seemed destined to resound in the historical imagination as the birthplace of knowledge itself. But how does the myth compare to history? How did the Babylonians themselves envisage their own knowledge?

In this course, we will explore whether the sciences and the humanities can make complementary contributions to the formation of knowledge, thus leading to the integration and unification of human knowledge. In the first part of the course we will take a historical approach to the issue; we will discuss how art and science were considered complementary for much of the 18th and 19th century (for example, in the views and work of Wolfgang Goethe), how they became separate ('the two cultures') in the middle of the 20th century with the compartmentalization of academic disciplines, and how some attempts have recently been made at a reunification under the concept of 'consilience'.

This class will consider some of the various ways in which that conclusion has been resisted by some twentieth- and twenty-first-century thinkers, drawing on a range of philosophical and religious perspectives - those, for example, of the Anglo-Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (who would complicate our understanding of what it means to &quot;believe&quot; anything); the German theologian Rudolf Bultmann (whose method precisely distinguished existential questions from scientific ones); and the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet (who thinks it imperative that the limits of scientific understanding be acknowledged in light of a Buddhist critique). Particular attention will be given to early writings from American pragmatist philosopher-scientists (William James, C. S. Peirce, and John Dewey), who argued that it is a mistake in the first place to think religion necessarily concerns anything &quot;supernatural&quot;; religion, for these thinkers, can therefore be understood as wholly consistent with naturalism.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The goal of this course is to gain an understanding of the historical roots of the concept of nature (Greek physis), while being attentive to the diversity of ancient Greek thought about nature even in its early history. In the texts we will read, numerous notions of &quot;nature&quot; can be discerned: for instance, nature as the physical form of an individual, nature as an underlying reality of someone or something, nature as an autonomous thing distinct from human art and from the supernatural, nature as the all-encompassing natural order, or nature as the natural environment. The conceptual and ideological work done by these conceptions also varies wildly. Furthermore, the images associated with the concepts are similarly diverse, ranging from human bodies to magical plants and cosmic spheres, and with a comparable repertory of conceptual and ideological purposes. Yet discussions of the concept of nature typically deal almost exclusively in abstractions: this is true, for instance, of the standard study of physis written over a century ago as a U of C dissertation, which we will read in excerpt. Throughout this class, we will consider not only the explicit and abstract conceptualization of nature, but also a number of related images-especially in the form of metaphors, analogies and personifications-that ultimately fed into the literary and philosophical depictions of nature in the long traditions that have followed.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

We will ask how divination can be a part of religious practice and how methods of future-telling are said to &quot;work&quot; from the perspective of the philosophers and scientists who practiced them. We will also explore the arguments against divination and identify and understand religious and/or scientific objections to the practice. All readings will be in English translation.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: An aggressive 
        book review of Grant Allen's <u>The Colour Sense: Its Origin and Development</u> 
        printed in the <u>Nature</u> issue of 3 April 1879. Original pagination

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 501]]</font> This 
        interesting and suggestive work deals with the whole question of colour 
        in nature, and more especially with its manifestations in the organic 
        world and the complex colour reactions between plants and animals. It 
        traces the origin of the colour sense in insects to their visits to primeval 
        flowers in order to feed upon the pollen, and in birds to their seeking 
        for fruits, whose seeds they dispersed and whose colours were developed 
        to attract them. It thus attempts to show that the very existence of most 
        of the brilliant colours of the organic world is due to the influence 
        of the colour sense in animals. The author adopts, with some reservations, 
        Mr. Darwin's theory of sexual selection to account for the colours of 
        most animals, and he endeavours to show that only those groups display 
        beautiful colours in which a taste for colour has been aroused by the 
        influence of flowers, fruits, or brilliant insects, their habitual food. 
        All these subjects are treated in a very thorough manner, with a wealth 
        of illustration, a clearness of style, and a cogency of reasoning, which 
        make up a most attractive volume; and though we may not agree with all 
        the author's conclusions, and may even doubt the accuracy of some of his 
        facts, we cannot but admit that he has placed the whole subject before 
        us in a way that must engage the attention both of the man of science 
        and the general reader. We will now proceed to give an outline of the 
        whole work, dwelling here and there on the more interesting points, and 
        especially on those where we venture to differ from the conclusions arrived 
        at.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an introductory chapter, the contents 
        of which are above indicated, an excellent account is given of the nature 
        of light, and of those peculiarities of the &aelig;ther-waves which produce 
        in us the sensations of light and colour. The third chapter deals with 
        the organ of vision, giving an account of its earliest appearance and 
        progressive complexity in the animal kingdom, and of the structure of 
        the eyes of the higher animals, and the relation of their parts to the 
        perception of light and of differences of colour. One of the most important 
        facts here brought out is, that the complex mechanism required to produce 
        vision has been several times independently evolved--the eye of the bee, 
        of the cuttle-fish, and of the eagle have each apparently been separately 
        developed from unlike remote sightless ancestors.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next chapter is a long and very interesting 
        one, on &quot;Insects and Flowers.&quot; It deals with the origin and development 
        of these two classes of organisms and their actions and reactions on each 
        other. It is full of interesting facts; and the discussion of the mode 
        of origin of the colours of flowers by a reference to the conditions under 
        which colour appears normally in living plants is especially instructive; 
        the generalisation being arrived at that the leaves which create or store 
        up energy for the plant are green, while whenever leaves lose this function 
        and become expenders of energy they lose the green tint and acquire various 
        other colours; growing shoots, young leaves, buds, stamens and stigmas, 
        and their protecting scales, are almost always variously coloured. The 
        rudiments of colour being thus always ready in the floral organs, it is 
        not surprising that flowers have been separately developed in monocotyledons 
        and dicotyledons, and also probably many times over in each of these divisions.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this part of his work the author exhibits 
        his tendency to trust far too much to negative evidence, especially to 
        that afforded by geology. He speaks of the carboniferous epoch as presenting 
        a green jungle of ferns and club-moss, &quot;in which there is no trace of 
        bee or moth or joyous butterfly;&quot; while &quot;scarlet berry and crimson blossom, 
        gorgeous bird, and painted insect were all equally absent from the unvaried 
        panorama of green overhead and brown beneath.&quot; As the flora preserved 
        to us in the coal-measures was almost certainly that of swamps only, we 
        cannot possibly tell what existed on the uplands and mountains of that 
        period. The enormous differentiation of flowering plants, and the comparatively 
        little change they seem to have undergone during the whole tertiary period 
        would lead to the inference that they may have already existed in some 
        variety during the carboniferous epoch; while the actual discovery of 
        a butterfly in the lower oolite, and of a well preserved wing of what 
        appears to be a large moth in the carboniferous shales of Belgium,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
        renders it quite possible that coloured flowers and gay butterflies <em>were</em> 
        then in existence. The statements as to the time when the different orders 
        of insects first came into being (quoted at p. 68) are quite worthless 
        when we consider how rare must be the conditions leading to the preservation 
        of winged insects, and they are already contradicted by well-known pal&aelig;ontological 
        facts. Another statement that seems equally open to doubt is, that even 
        in early tertiary times there were no orchids (p. 97), a statement founded 
        on the generalisation that entomophilous monocotyledons are later productions 
        than entomophilous dicotyledons, because the perianth of the former is 
        usually less specialised. But surely in orchids the perianth is more highly 
        specialised than in any existing flowers whatever; and if we take into 
        account the world-wide distribution of these plants, their immense richness 
        in genera and species, and their wonderful complexity of structure, we 
        must consider them as among the most ancient instead of the most recent 
        of flowers. They are also exceptions to the general rule of the size of 
        the flower being in inverse proportion to its special adaptation to insect 
        fertilisation; of which the large but simple lilies and tulips as contrasted 
        with the small but complex labiates, are quoted as examples.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next chapter, on the colour sense in insects, 
        sets forth both the direct and the indirect evidence on this question; 
        such as Sir John Lubbock's experiments on bees and wasps, the mimicking 
        insects which deceive other insects, the clear relation of coloured flowers 
        to the visits of insects, the fact of insects often visiting hundreds 
        of the same species of flower in succession, &amp;c. This chapter concludes 
        with a striking picture of the vast effect which has been produced on 
        the appearance of external nature by insect agency, &quot;which has turned 
        the <font color="990000">[[p. 502]]</font> whole surface of the earth 
        into a boundless flower-garden,&quot; supplying insects from year to year with 
        pollen or honey, and itself gaining in return a renewal of life by means 
        of the baits that it offers for their allurement. &quot;If,&quot; adds Mr. Allen, 
        &quot;any man can seriously doubt that these changes are really due to a colour 
        sense in the little creatures which live upon the beautiful flowers; if 
        he can imagine that the plant has produced its gorgeous petals for no 
        other purpose than that of suicidal wastefulness; that the <em>Mantis</em> 
        has grown into the perfect semblance of a leaf from pure wanton causeless 
        mimicry; that the lurid red of fly-fertilised blossoms bears its likeness 
        to the mangled flesh of animals by a simple freak of creative power; then 
        the whole science and philosophy of the last hundred years have been thrown 
        away upon him, and he may return at leisure to the blind and hopeless 
        chance of the eighteenth century atheists.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relation of birds and mammals to fruits 
        is next discussed, and this is shown to be in many respects parallel to 
        that of insects and flowers, only those fruits being conspicuously coloured 
        which are edible, and the dispersal of whose seeds is effected by the 
        birds or other animals which eat them. The whole of this subject is very 
        well treated, but the evidence that fruits in general have been modified 
        both in edibility and attractiveness in relation to the animals which 
        feed upon them, is by no means so clear as in the case of flowers. With 
        regard to small and hard-seeded fruits, such as our strawberries, currants, 
        and raspberries, our hips and haws, our yews and cranberries, this is 
        no doubt the case, since they are carried away by birds and vegetate after 
        passing through their bodies. It is also the case with such fruits as 
        the nutmeg, whose bulky seeds pass undigested through the stomachs of 
        the great fruit pigeons, but whether the same rule applies to most of 
        the larger fruits may be doubted except when they have hard, stony seed-coverings, 
        as in the case of plums and apricots, which evidently protect the seeds 
        from being eaten, or, if eaten, from being digested. But the majority 
        of the larger fruits are eaten by mammals, and it is doubtful whether 
        their seeds can survive the process. Such are oranges and shaddocks, and 
        gourds of various kinds, while many large bright-coloured fruits of the 
        tropics do not seem to be eaten at all. Many of these are very round and 
        smooth, and may get dispersed by mere rolling down hill, as occurred with 
        the mango in Jamaica,<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> or by being accidentally 
        disturbed by the feet of animals. It is to be observed, too, that the 
        fruits of trees are usually so abundant that, if eatable, there is no 
        danger of their not being eaten even if uncoloured, as in the case of 
        our acorns, beech-nuts, and chestnuts. An immense number of the tropical 
        fruits eaten by monkeys and parrots are not coloured, and the half-developed 
        seeds are often alone eaten; while in others, as the jack-fruit, bread-fruit, 
        and durian, the large seeds are as eatable as the pulpy mass, and the 
        edible nature of the fruit must be injurious rather than otherwise as 
        leading to the destruction of seeds. This need be no difficulty when we 
        consider that with forest trees, which live for several centuries, there 
        is only vacant space for young trees at long intervals, and thus no rigid 
        selection of seeds takes place tending to secure them from being destroyed 
        as food for animals.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On account of the fondness of most birds and 
        other animals for the very same fruits which we like best, Mr. Allen maintains 
        the general community of taste in all animals. I have, however, usually 
        found monkeys eating fruits which were very disagreeable to me, and the 
        theory is hardly consistent with the fact that many nauseous fruits are 
        bright-coloured. Thus the <em>Citrullus colocynthus </em>of Palestine 
        has a beautiful fruit of the size and colour of an orange, but, according 
        to Canon Tristram, &quot;nauseous beyond description to the taste,&quot;--while 
        the <em>Solanum sanctum</em>, generally called the &quot;Dead Sea apple,&quot; is 
        almost equally disagreeable, but is of a brilliant red colour. Now if 
        these fruits are eaten by any animals their taste must be very different 
        from ours, while if they are not, these fruits have become strikingly 
        attractive from other causes than to induce animals to eat and disperse 
        them. This latter view is supported by another fruit, also found in Palestine, 
        the <em>Calotropis procera</em>, which is as large as an apple and bright 
        yellow, but is full of thin flat seeds winged with exquisitely fine silky 
        filaments. Here, then, the seeds having special powers of dispersal by 
        the wind do not need the aid of animals, yet the fruit is most attractively 
        coloured. This is one of the Apocynace&aelig;, which are usually poisonous, 
        and I have observed brilliantly coloured fruits of the same order in the 
        tropics, but some of these are known to be eatable. Taking into consideration 
        all the facts, it seems probable that attractive fruits are more abundant 
        among the smaller trees and shrubs of temperate lands than in the forests 
        of the tropics, and that their colours are largely due to those adventitious 
        causes which our author has himself so well elucidated. When their distribution 
        has been aided by birds their colours, their edibility, and the non-digestibility 
        of their seeds would all be increased by natural selection. The dry fruits 
        of herbaceous plants, in which the struggle for existence is probably 
        more severe, have no doubt often been prevented from acquiring bright 
        colours by natural selection in order to protect their seeds, just as 
        so many insects and birds have acquired brown or green protective tints.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A curious point in relation to this question, 
        and one that has not been noticed by our author, is the very different 
        characteristic colours of fruits and flowers. I have tabulated the colours 
        of these, under four heads, taken from two books of manageable size--Hooker's 
        &quot;British Flora&quot; and Mongredien's &quot;Trees and Shrubs for English Plantations.&quot; 
        The colours of the two classes I find to be as follows, dividing the purples 
        between the red and blue to the best of my judgment, and taking black 
        among fruits as corresponding to blue in flowers.</p>

      <p>Here we see that white and yellow which immensely preponderate in flowers 
        are very scarce among fruits, among which red and blue (or black) predominate, 
        the two colours which are far less common in flowers. We must <font color="990000">[[p. 
        503]]</font> conclude, either that there is not a community of taste in 
        colour between insects and birds, or, that what may be termed the normal 
        colours of both have been more or less intensified and utilised by natural 
        selection in order to attract insects and birds respectively.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next chapter, on the colour-sense in vertebrates, 
        clearly establishes the fact of the possession of this sense by all vertebrate 
        animals, but more especially by birds and reptiles. The evidence of such 
        a sense in mammalia generally is very scanty, though it undoubtedly exists 
        in monkeys; while there are good reasons for believing that it is more 
        acute in birds than even in ourselves. Birds on the whole need to perceive 
        colour more than any other animals, both because the insects and fruits 
        and buds on which so many of them feed are small variously-coloured objects, 
        and because from their habits they require to see and recognise these 
        objects from a considerable distance. It is therefore a remarkable confirmation 
        of the modern theory--that the cones of the retina are colour organs while 
        the rods are only light organs, that in birds the cones are three times 
        as numerous as the rods, while in mammals they are less numerous. Nocturnal 
        birds, such as owls, however, have very few cones, while nocturnal mammals 
        have none. The <em>macula lutea</em>, a central yellow spot consisting 
        largely of cones, is found in man and monkeys only, while it exists in 
        all diurnal birds, and these in addition have their cones furnished with 
        variously-coloured globules, which are supposed to give a still more perfect 
        perception of colour. The eye of the chameleon is as perfect as that of 
        a bird, and this accords with its capacity of colour change, and the extreme 
        accuracy with which it detects and captures insects. Mammals, on the other 
        hand, even the insectivorous and frugivorous kinds, have very little occasion 
        for a refined colour sense, since the great mass of creeping insects are 
        of obscure colours, while the squirrels and allies feed on brown nuts 
        rather than on coloured fruits. The evidence seems to show, therefore, 
        that a tolerably perfect colour-sense has only been attained, among mammalia, 
        in the monkeys and man, while even in these it is probably very inferior 
        to that of birds. It seems probable, therefore, that the prevalence of 
        colour-blindness is really an indication of the colour sense in man having 
        been a comparatively recent development, instead of being, as Mr. Allen 
        thinks, a disease of civilisation. An acute colour sense is certainly 
        not of the first importance to savages; and though our author has adduced 
        valuable evidence that most savages distinguish colours just as well as 
        we do, it is very important to ascertain whether colour-blindness exists 
        among uncivilised peoples to a greater or a less extent than among Europeans.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next chapter, on the direct action of the 
        colour sense upon the animal integuments, deals with the theory of sexual 
        selection as advanced by Mr. Darwin, and endeavours to support it by a 
        variety of general considerations. Many of these arguments are very weak, 
        and are often founded on insufficient or erroneous facts, some of which 
        I shall endeavour to point out. The great aim of this chapter is to prove 
        that the colours of animals are intimately associated with the colours 
        of the objects they feed upon. Butterflies and moths being the most beautifully 
        coloured of all insects and feeding on flowers, is held to be the first 
        great fact in support of this view; and this is backed up by the remark 
        that &quot;the colours of caterpillars are mostly protective, being due to 
        natural selection alone, while those of butterflies are mostly attractive, 
        being largely due to sexual selection.&quot; To this we must altogether demur, 
        as slurring over what is really a stupendous difficulty in the way of 
        the theory. So far from the colours of caterpillars being &quot;mostly protective&quot; 
        every entomologist knows that a large number of caterpillars in every 
        part of the world are conspicuously coloured, and what is more to the 
        point that their colours are as brilliant and varied as those of butterflies 
        themselves, if we take into account the nature of their integument, the 
        small amount of surface, and the uniform cylindrical form of their bodies. 
        The caterpillar of <em>Papilio dissimilis</em>, for instance, on a bluish 
        green ground has a series of broad irregular longitudinal bands of the 
        richest orange yellow, and between these there are a number of round red 
        spots; while those of many of the Eupl&aelig;as are adorned with exquisite 
        pink and yellow markings, and with a number of long fleshy processes of 
        equally brilliant colours. Owing to caterpillars being so difficult to 
        preserve, and being rarely collected and figured in their native countries, 
        comparatively few of them are known, but it is certain that they often 
        exhibit the most brilliant hues and the most exquisite patterns; and as 
        they may be said to feed invariably on green leaves, while sexual selection 
        cannot affect them, the natural inference is that the same general laws 
        which produce colour in them are quite sufficient for the production of 
        even more varied hues in the perfect insects, whose expanded wing surfaces, 
        ever varying in size, form, and neuration, offer a field so much better 
        fitted for its development.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In beetles the appearance of colour is also 
        attempted to be correlated with their flower-haunting habits by means 
        of equally doubtful facts. The magnificent Buprestid&aelig; and Longicorns 
        are, as far as my experience goes, almost wholly wood-feeders, frequenting 
        the bark of dead trees, and very rarely found on flowers; the Clerid&aelig; 
        and Silphid&aelig; feeding on dead animal matter, are often brilliantly 
        coloured; and generally in beetles, the absence of colour may be traced 
        to the need of concealment and protection, while whenever a special mode 
        of protection exists, whether by nauseous secretions, hard integuments, 
        rapid flight, or facilities for concealment, then colour appears in infinitely 
        various phases; and this law generally prevails throughout the whole insect-world. 
        In his argument in favour of bright hues being attractive to the opposite 
        sexes of insects, Mr. Allen seems always to forget that it is the male 
        that is attracted to the female, and not <em>vice vers&acirc;</em>; and 
        when he says (p. 158) that he &quot;cannot see why Mr. Wallace, who allows 
        the attractive nature of colouring in flowers, should deny its attractive 
        nature in the question of sex,&quot; I reply, that in flowers colour enables 
        the insect to recognise the species, but no one has ever asserted that 
        insects improve and alter the colour of flowers by their preference for 
        certain varieties of colour irrespective of the honey or pollen produced; 
        and in like manner I maintain that the colour of an insect is a guide 
        to easy recognition by its mate, but that there is not one single particle 
        of evidence to show that minute differences in the colour of the same 
        species are observed by insects, still less that such differences are 
        so important <font color="990000">[[p. 504]]</font> to them as to lead 
        to the rejection of a healthy and well-organised mate; yet unless this 
        is the case, the whole theory of sexual selection falls to the ground.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the general connection between coloured 
        flowers and coloured insects is by no means so general and constant as 
        Mr. Allen supposes. Perhaps the richest displays of gay flowers in the 
        world are to be found in temperate Australia, in South Africa, and in 
        the South European Alps, yet in all these countries the butterflies are 
        very inferior to those of tropical forests, where flowers are comparatively 
        rare. In the forests of Para, for instance, gay flowers are very scarce, 
        as noticed by Mr. Bates as well as by myself, yet the butterflies are 
        endless in their variety of lovely hues. Of course there <em>are</em> 
        bright flowers in the tropics, and as travellers notice these whenever 
        they see them and also notice the handsome butterflies, it is easy to 
        infer, as is here done, that the two invariably go together. We may also 
        remark that the sexual allurement of a peculiar odour given out by special 
        patches of scales on butterflies' wings has been discovered by Fritz M&uuml;ller 
        in the genera <em>Mechanitis</em>, <em>Dircenna</em>, and <em>Thecla</em>, 
        all very brilliantly coloured groups, a clear indication that colour is 
        not a sexual allurement, or we should find it most developed, not in conjunction 
        with, but in the absence of, the attraction of odour.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now pass on to the vertebrates, and 
        we here find very good evidence adduced of the existence of a colour-sense 
        in fishes, reptiles, and birds, as we should expect from the known structure 
        of their eyes; while in the case of mammals it is far less decisive. The 
        attempt to associate the brilliant colours of these animals with their 
        food and surroundings, acting through sexual selection, is, however, what 
        we have now to consider; and though many alleged facts are adduced in 
        support of it, several of them are as doubtful and inconclusive as in 
        the case of insects. We shall confine our attention to the birds, which 
        are the stronghold of the theory, and are so much more completely known 
        than the less highly-organised fishes and reptiles. Mr. Allen claims the 
        parrots as fruit-eaters, but they are really seed-eaters, their bills 
        being specially formed to crack the shells and extract and grind up the 
        kernels of nuts and other fruits. They do not therefore aid in the disposal 
        of seeds, as they feed on brown nuts or unripe green fruits from which 
        they extract the seeds, much more frequently than on coloured ripe fruits. 
        The general green colour of parrots is undoubtedly protective, and this 
        green colour is lost, and vivid tints appear just in proportion as, owing 
        to various conditions, the need of concealment diminishes. This is especially 
        the case in countries where mammals are few and a low type of organisation 
        prevails, as in the Australian region, in Madagascar, and in South America; 
        while in Africa and Asia, where a higher type of organisation prevails, 
        the colours of parrots are more sober and protective. A little further 
        on we find the Australian honey-suckers noted for their magnificent coloration; 
        the fact being that they are decidedly a dull-coloured group, hardly superior 
        to our thrushes, and not equal to our finches. Yet they are as universally 
        flower-feeders as the humming-birds themselves; and the total absence 
        of brilliant colour from these birds, which are <em>the</em> characteristic 
        family of Australia, and have been developed in correlation with the brilliant 
        Australian flora, absolutely negatives the idea of colour in birds being 
        dependent on the amount of colour in the food and surroundings of certain 
        groups. Again, the ground-feeding pheasant family are passed over as containing 
        only one brilliant bird, the peacock, whereas it abounds in species of 
        the most gorgeous colour. Such are the Impeyan pheasant of the Himalayas, 
        whose metallic plumage is that of a gigantic sun-bird; the golden pheasant, 
        the silver pheasant, and Reeves' pheasant of China, all unsurpassed for 
        gay and conspicuous colouring; the glorious crimson and white-spotted 
        tragopans, the elegant peacock-pheasants, and the intensely brilliant 
        fire-backed pheasants of the Malay countries--together composing a group 
        of birds whose colours are unsurpassed for beauty and splendour, and thus 
        are directly opposed to the general gloom and absence of colour in their 
        habitual surroundings.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In treating of mammals we find an equal want 
        of discrimination in estimating comparative colour and conspicuousness. 
        The tigers, the zebras, the beautifully marked antelopes, and the spotted 
        deer and giraffes, which are really among the most brightly-coloured of 
        all mammals, are passed over as less beautifully coloured than the squirrels 
        and monkeys, in order to support the theory that arboreal mammals feeding 
        on fruits should be (though unfortunately for the theory they are not) 
        the most brightly coloured. Monkeys, as a rule, are very dingy brown or 
        black, about one or two per cent. of the species have patches of bright 
        colour on the bare skin of various parts of their bodies, while the nut-eating 
        squirrels as a whole are certainly not superior to the grazing antelopes. 
        In the summary of facts given at pages 184 and 185 there are many errors. 
        <em>Scissirostrum Pagei</em> does not &quot;belong to a family generally dull,&quot; 
        while it is itself decidedly dull-coloured; the &quot;pretty cigana&quot; is a very 
        plain coloured bird; Santarem, of which it is said &quot;the pastures are destitute 
        of flowers, and also of animal life, with the exception of a few small 
        plain-coloured birds,&quot; is one of the richest localities for flowering 
        shrubs in South America, and one of the few places where I remember the 
        conspicuously coloured fruits on many of these shrubs, while the butterflies 
        in the adjacent forests are gorgeous in the extreme; and lastly, the &quot;gay-coloured 
        squirrel,&quot; for which I myself am made responsible, is one of the dullest 
        of the group, pretty indeed as are all squirrels, owing to its brown and 
        yellowish ringed tail, but in no sense whatever &quot;gay,&quot; while I certainly 
        say not a word about its feeding on &quot;bright-coloured fruits.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such mistakes as these pervade this portion 
        of the work, and are made the foundation for repeated argument and illustration; 
        and they serve to show how impossible it is even for the most earnest 
        and enthusiastic student to make a few months' labour suffice for a correct 
        appreciation of the bearing of the overwhelming mass of facts presented 
        by the countless species of the animal and vegetable world. I have marked 
        a number of other passages to which I altogether demur, but many of them 
        involve arguments which would extend far beyond the limits of an article. 
        For the same reason I can only briefly refer to the concluding chapters 
        on the &quot;Colour Sense in Man,&quot; in which the theory of Mr. Gladstone and 
        the German philologists is disproved in a manner which is absolutely conclusive.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summary and recapitulation we find all 
        the facts <font color="990000">[[p. 505]]</font> and arguments we have 
        referred to marshalled in an imposing array, and finally summed up in 
        the following condensed formula:--</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p><font size="-1">
      <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Insects produce flowers. Flowers produce 
        the colour-sense in insects. The colour-sense produces a taste for colour. 
        The taste for colour produces butterflies and brilliant beetles. Birds 
        and mammals produce fruits. Fruits produce a taste for colour in birds 
        and mammals. The taste for colour produces the external hues of humming-birds, 
        parrots, and monkeys. Man's frugivorous ancestry produces in him a similar 
        taste; and that taste produces the final result of human chromatic arts.&quot;</blockquote>
      </font> 
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I totally differ from Mr. Allen's conclusions 
        as to the production of the varied colours of the animal world, I must 
        express the extreme pleasure with which I have read his book, which I 
        most cordially recommend to all who love colour, and can enjoy a thoroughly 
        well-written volume on a most interesting but difficult subject.</p>

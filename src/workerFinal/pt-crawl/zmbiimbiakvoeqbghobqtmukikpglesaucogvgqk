This document is a response to four questions D-Lib proposed to the six institutions       
funded under the current NSF/ARPA/NASA Digital Library Initiative. It is assumed that       
the reader will have some familiarity with the projects at least at the level of the articles       
in the May 1996 issue of      
<a href = "http://www.computer.org/">IEEE Computer       
Magazine</a>.

<i>1. What is available in the test beds for experimentation among the DLI       
members?</i>      
<p>      
<b>Content</b>      
<p>      
The University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL) project currently has six large       
publishing partners who have contributed over 2,000 titles of content to the project. We       
are in active negotiation with several more. Some of this material is unlicensed. Through       
specially arrangements we may be able to provide licensed material for use by other sites.      
<p>      
<b>Use of the ontology</b>      
<p>      
A central issue in UMDL is that of the description of content and  terms and  conditions       
for use of information goods and services. We have formalized description methods for       
information objects and services. These descriptions are used in a metadata structure we       
call a conspectus. We will share both with others.      
<p>      
<b>Agentware and Other Software</b>      
<p>      
Functionality of the digital library increases through building agents in three categories:       
interface agents, collection agents, and a variety of mediator agents. The mediator agents       
form teams to respond to specific information brokering tasks between requests from the       
interface agents to the collection agents. The agent software library now includes agents       
such as those to provide access to a Broad System of (search term) Ordering and       
thesaurus. Other specific agents include task planners, registry agents, remora agent,       
indexers, and an early version of an auction server. We also have tools for building       
agents. Other software modules include an enhanced Z39.50 client, the Inquiry Interface       
developed for use in teaching middle and high school science, and our FTL search       
engine.        
<p>      
      
<i>2.  What is available in the test beds for experimentation among other       
groups?</i>      
<p>      
All of the items in  question 1, although perhaps on different terms. We are also looking       
for  partnership in build collection interface agents around commercial collections to       
federate them with UMDL.      
<p>      
<i>3. What are the plans for the test beds at the end of the project?</i>      
<p>      
Broad constituencies of the  University of Michigan consider leadership in  establishment       
of global digital libraries and related collaboration environments to be of great strategic       
importance to the quality and vitality of the University of the future. The       
NSF/ARPA/NASA UMDL Project is the primary basic research and development project       
in this area, but is complemented by a variety of other nearer term and more applied       
projects to provide digital library services to the UM community immediately. Examples       
can be found at      
<A HREF = "http://www.lib.umich.edu/libhome/electres.html">      
http://www.lib.umich.edu/libhome/electres.html</a> and at       
<A HREF = "http://www.jstor.org/">http://www.jstor.org/</A>. We have tried to anticipate success.      
<p>      
Technology from the Digital Library Initiative, collections, and experience are already       
rolling into the new Digital Library Production Capability. This organizations is jointly       
sponsored by the University Libraries      
(<A HREF = "http://www.lib.umich.edu/">http://www.lib.umich.edu/</a>), the UM Information       
Technology Division  
(<A HREF = "http://www.itd.umich.edu/">http://www.itd.umich.edu/</a>), and the School of  
Information       
(<A HREF = "http://www.si.umich.edu/">http://www.si.umich.edu/</A>). The testbeds is also supporting      
the agenda of the new       
Michigan Media Union      
(<A HREF = "http://www.si.umich.edu/">http://www.ummu.umich.edu/</A>) and related academic      
outreach       
and virtual university experiments.      
<p>      
<i>4. What can be done now to anticipate the continued operation of the       
test beds (use & R&D) beyond the current project?</i>      
<p>      
The key is to building a successful inter-institutional production digital library operation.       
We are focusing primarily on serving academic communities but also have experiments       
underway on the future of public libraries (see the Internet Public Library      
[<A HREF = "http://www.ipl.org/">http://www.ipl.org/</A>] and       
Community Networking System     
[<A HREF = "http://www.si.umich.edu/Community/">http://www.si.umich.edu/Community/</A>]).      
<p>      
We are supporting inter-institutional work through the National Digital Library       
Federation involving several major academic libraries and the Library of Congress. The       
group  is targeting partial ways (both technical and organizational challenges) to federate       
DL collections. One major issue at present is the considerable variability in capability       
among institutions for federation (e.g., interoperability, metadata, commerce, etc.), and       
the considerable administrative distance on many campus between the library and       
computing sectors.      
<P>      
Most of the agreements that we and others have with content providers are for a bounded       
term with a bounded user community. The long-term success of  digital libraries will       
depend heavily on solving the type of issues we are addressing about licensing and       
payment mechanisms (pricing models)  in the UMDL architecture. Digital library       
frameworks and environments must provide incentive for continued commercial       
participation. We are now optimistic about long-term use within the University of       
Michigan community, but most certainly will not be able to provide our complete content       
“free to the net.” We are also optimistic that  inquiry-based approaches to science       
education being support by UMDL in the Ann Arbor Schools is being written into the       
formal school curriculum. The take-up is starting.      
<P>      
Long term viability of a digital library federation requires an incentive for large number       
of parties to participate and the entry cost for participation to be reasonable.      
<P>      
We are just now approaching a system which is robust enough to explore some of our       
conjectures, for example scaling (won't know until we try more), incentives for       
commercial participation, and more advances interfaces. We recognize the challenges of        
building in context of rapidly changing standards for convergence/coherence. When will       
there be another Web like explosion? How do you design projects that accommodate       
massive paradigm shifts?      
<P>      
As exciting as current developments are, we believe that  in the DLI we are now building       
“horseless carriages.”  There is a future we can’t yet see or describe well. There are much       
more fundamental opportunities for new approaches to information and knowledge work       
environments. What are the new authoring formats, new media, new genres? What will       
access mean? What if we had agentware as the beginning -- now what can you build?

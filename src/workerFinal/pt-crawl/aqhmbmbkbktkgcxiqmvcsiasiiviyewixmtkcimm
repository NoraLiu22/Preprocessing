        <font size=-1><u>Abstract</u>: The work of Alfred Russel Wallace, much 
        the "other man" in the history of the development of the theory of natural 
        selection, remains poorly contextualized. A good deal of the literature 
        on Wallace (including a fair number of items now available for mass consumption 
        on the World Wide Web) promotes views on his positions that rest on rather 
        shaky foundations. In the present report I focus on the question of whether 
        he had a "change of mind" regarding the relationship of natural selection 
        to the evolution of humankind. It has long been asserted by some sources 
        that either or both Wallace's conversion to spiritualism or his long-held 
        utopian social views caused him to reject Darwinian selection mechanisms; 
        I argue instead that there is good reason to think that Wallace's highly 
        idiosyncratic teleology allowed him to embrace both natural selection 
        and spiritualism without inconsistency. There is nothing in Wallace's 
        early writings to suggest, for example, that he felt natural selection 
        accounted for the origin--as opposed to maintenance--of conscious awareness 
        in human beings. One in fact surmises that the famous Ternate essay of 
        1858 may well have been intended to solve a rather smaller set of problems 
        than it has usually been given credit for.</font><br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name Alfred Russel Wallace should be familiar to 
        most students of the history of science; not only is he recognized as 
        the independent discoverer of the principle of natural selection, but 
        as the 'father' of the field of zoogeography, as history's pre-eminent 
        tropical naturalist, and as a significant contributor to several other 
        fields of knowledge as well. Yet there still seems to be some considerable 
        disagreement as to the overall importance of Wallace's work. To begin 
        with, his reputation has suffered from his 'other man' status and from 
        his association with what he called his 'heresies'--interests in various 
        liberal social causes, and in spiritualism. Further, few persons have 
        apparently explored the full range of his writings with a mind toward 
        synthesis, and this fact has made the drawing of informed conclusions 
        about him difficult. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result--and despite good work by such investigators 
          as Barbara Beddall, Lewis McKinney, John Langdon Brooks and Malcolm 
          Kottler--there is still a lot about Wallace that is not generally known. 
          Indeed, much of what <i>is</i> known about him is often overlooked or 
          inadvertently distorted in treatments of his work. A recent ethnological 
          study, for example, refers to him--twice--as 'Sir' Alfred Russel Wallace, 
          a mistake that is best contextualized by noting that as late as 1908 
          Wallace published a public letter of denial in a deliberate effort to 
          dispel a rumor that he was about to be knighted. The same work states 
          incorrectly that his field studies in Indonesia were subsidized by the 
          British and Dutch colonial regimes. In another recent paper the author 
          states that there is no "testimony" by Wallace himself as to whether 
          his debated 'change of mind' regarding the application of natural selection 
          to humankind was due to his adoption of spiritualist beliefs--despite 
          the fact that such commentary does exist, and in a fairly conspicuous 
          place: the Preface to his book <i>On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism</i>. 
          This writer also states that "there is no evidence" that Wallace was 
          "in any way" influenced by the writings of William Whewell--but Wallace 
          himself discusses Whewell on multiple occasions and the serial literature 
          includes several articles on this very subject. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation is even worse in the realm of more 
          popular treatments. Take, for example, materials now available on the 
          World Wide Web. I have recently performed <a href="ITSONWEB.htm">a survey 
          of such offerings</a>; what I found was rather troubling. On one site 
          he is referred to as an American; on another, as a "grad student." From 
          the text of a publicly-presented lecture available at another site we 
          can read: "...like Darwin, he had written a book on the origin of species, 
          citing exactly the same kinds of evidence and reaching precisely the 
          same conclusion. ...Darwin now...said Wallace should be allowed to publish 
          first. Wallace insisted on Darwin's right to be first. So they presented 
          a paper together to the Linnean Society..." Practically all of the assertions 
          made here are, of course, simply untrue: Wallace had not written a book 
          on the origin of species, had not cited the same evidence, hadn't insisted 
          that Darwin be allowed to publish first--nor did they even present a 
          paper together. Another source suggests: "Wallace had requested time 
          to speak at an upcoming conference to officially put forth his theory. 
          Some of Charles Darwin's friends...heard about this and decided that 
          the credit should go to Darwin, not Wallace. They did this by asking 
          the meeting organizers for a few minutes just before Wallace to read 
          aloud excerpts from some of Darwin's letters and notes to them which 
          dealt with his theory of evolution..." And this last quotation comes 
          from the notes for a college course on evolution! 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, there is still work to do. Earlier I implied 
          that one of the main reasons that Wallace's work has been difficult 
          to assess is the sheer bulk of his writings, and the fact of their being 
          on so many subjects. Few investigators have done more than sample from 
          his overall oeuvre, and in Wallace's case such efforts run the danger 
          of producing conclusions that are based more on 20-20 hindsight resulting 
          from the priority of Darwin's work than on Wallace's own thoughts. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the time I have here it will not be possible 
          to detail the overall approach to Wallace's world view I have been working 
          out. I should at least like, however, to plant a few seeds of doubt 
          as to whether the current model provides an adequate framework for appreciating 
          his contribution. Wallace, we know, was an evolutionist as far back 
          as 1844 or 1845, the time of his reading of Robert Chambers's <i>Vestiges 
          of the Natural History of Creation</i>. We also know that by 1855 he 
          was ready to promote an evolutionary biogeographic model--in the form 
          of the Sarawak 'On the Law...' paper--in print. Further, there seems 
          to be no reason to disbelieve his own words describing the revelation--natural 
          selection--that came to him in early 1858 during that famous bout with 
          malaria. And we may truly believe in his full support for the theory 
          from that point on to the end of his days. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe, however, that a careful study of Wallace's 
          writings--that is to say, all of his writings--leads one to question 
          the common wisdom that his ideas on evolution in general describe a 
          rather straight line development up through 1858, and a major retrenchment 
          thereafter. To the contrary, it appears to me that before 1858 Wallace's 
          position on the nature of adaptation had steered him quite away from 
          a natural selection-like interpretation of development, and instead 
          in a more teleological, even Newtonian, direction. This latter path 
          had resulted from his steadfast resistance to the notion that a general 
          model of the <i>process</i> of adaptation was obtainable--it appeared 
          to Wallace that adaptive functions were quite unrelated to phylogenetic 
          station, and that to argue otherwise was Creationist. Further, he had 
          already come to the conclusion that many human adaptive traits could 
          not be linked directly to environmental causal agents. When in 1858 
          the principle of natural selection finally occurred to him, it provided 
          a solution to the first problem, but not to the second. His exploration 
          of Spiritualism a few years later provided the final piece to the puzzle, 
          allowing him to view both physical and mental adaptations in causally 
          generalizable terms. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe I can make this argument in a variety 
          of ways and in some detail at this point, but for the present I will 
          concentrate on aspects of two related items only: Wallace's supposed 
          post-1858 support of the Darwinian model of natural selection, and what 
          I view as his early resistance to the notion of necessary utility of 
          adaptive structures. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Wallace returned home to England in 1862 he 
          was something of a celebrity among naturalists. The role he had played 
          in Darwin's publication of <i>On the Origin of Species</i> was well 
          known, at the very least, to insiders in the movement, and they soon 
          embraced his efforts supporting the cause. It is usually thought that 
          Wallace's support for Darwin in the years immediately following 1858 
          was more or less total, and that he only came to doubt certain tenets 
          of the theory by the mid-1860s. Evidence exists, however, that should 
          lead us to question this understanding. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may first be noted that Wallace--a man who produced 
          in sum over 10,000 pages of writings, and who never published fewer 
          than ten works in any two year period over the last sixty years of his 
          life--wrote not a single word on the subject of natural selection between 
          February of 1858 (the Ternate essay) and the fall of 1863, when he penned 
          his classic analysis on the manner of construction of bee cells. Indeed, 
          with one or two rather trivial exceptions, his writings during this 
          period hardly mention the subject of evolution in any context, instead 
          concentrating on biogeographical subjects of the kind discussed in the 
          1855 'On the Law...' essay. Why, we should ask ourselves, was this the 
          case? Why would a man whose every fibre of being had been engaged for 
          some fifteen years in an attempt to answer the question of how evolution 
          took place, suddenly come up short when the opportunity to make his 
          views known at last emerged? Could it possibly be that the answer to 
          the question that he (and Darwin) had set forth did not completely satisfy 
          him, and that he wished to look at the matter further before putting 
          himself on record? 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that this was in fact the case, and that 
          the 'On the Tendency...' essay represented an interim stage in his thinking 
          only. He may well never have published it--at least in the form that 
          was sent to Darwin--had he had the chance to fully control its fate. 
          Fortifying this impression is an interesting series of events, previously 
          unnoticed, concerning Wallace's future referrals to the work. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1869 the German zoologist Adolf Bernhard Meyer 
          sought Wallace's permission to publish a German translation of the Ternate 
          essay. In a letter to Meyer (later itself reprinted in <i>Nature</i> 
          in 1895), Wallace wrote "As soon as my ague fit was over I sat down, 
          wrote out the article, copied it, and sent it off by the next post to 
          Mr. Darwin. It was printed without my knowledge, and of course without 
          any correction of proofs. I should, of course, like this act to be stated." 
          The situation was in fact so stated, as a note to the text, when the 
          translation was printed the next year, but apparently this was not enough 
          to assuage Wallace's sense of historical responsibility. When the essay 
          was reprinted in the monograph collection <i>Natural Selection and Tropical 
          Nature</i> in 1891, Wallace added a single note to it on page 27: "'And 
          that of their offspring' should have been added. But it must be remembered 
          that the writer had no opportunity of correcting the proofs of this 
          paper." 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three mentions of the matter in print were still 
          not enough for him. In the article "The Dawn of a Great Discovery," 
          published in 1903, Wallace stated the situation as follows: "...in the 
          two succeeding evenings [I] wrote it out in full, and sent it by the 
          next post to Mr. Darwin... I also asked him, if he thought well of it, 
          to show it to Sir Charles Lyell, but I said nothing about its publication." 
          Wallace was now eighty years old, but two years later, in Volume One 
          of <i>My Life</i>, he raised the issue yet again: "The paper is reprinted 
          in my <i>Natural Selection and Tropical Nature</i>, and in reading it 
          <i>now</i> it must be remembered that it was but a hasty first sketch, 
          that I had no opportunity of revising it before it was printed in the 
          journal of the Linnean Society..." 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are a lot of apologies for what is arguably 
          among the most influential essays in the history of human thought. Did 
          Wallace possibly feel his words had not been taken up entirely as he 
          intended? If so, what <i>were</i> his real intentions? 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1853, as part of his book <i>A Narrative of Travels 
          on the Amazon and Rio Negro</i>, Wallace wrote as follows: 
        <blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It must strike every one, 
          that the numbers of birds and insects of different groups, having scarcely 
          any resemblance to each other, which yet feed on the same food and inhabit 
          the same localities, cannot have been so differently constructed and 
          adorned for that purpose alone. Thus the goat-suckers, the swallows, 
          the tyrant flycatchers, and the jacamars, all use the same kind of food, 
          and procure it in the same manner: they all capture insects on the wing, 
          yet how entirely different is the structure and the whole appearance 
          of these birds!... What birds can have their bills more peculiarly formed 
          than the ibis, the spoonbill, and the heron? Yet they may be seen side 
          by side, picking up the same food from the shallow water on the beach; 
          and on opening their stomachs, we find the same little crustacea and 
          shell-fish in them all. Then among the fruit-eating birds, there are 
          pigeons, parrots, toucans, and chatterers,--families as distinct and 
          widely separated as possible,--which yet may be often seen feeding all 
          together on the same tree; for in the forests of South America, certain 
          fruits are favourites with almost every kind of fruit-eating bird. It 
          has been assumed by some writers on Natural History, that every wild 
          fruit is the food of some bird or animal, and that the varied forms 
          and structure of their mouths may be necessitated by the peculiar character 
          of the fruits they are to feed on; but there is more of imagination 
          than fact in this statement: the number of wild fruits furnishing food 
          for birds is very limited, and the birds of the most varied structure 
          and of every size will be found visiting the same tree."</font></blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We find in this early passage evidence that Wallace 
        had rejected the notion of necessary one-to-one association between particular 
        environmental influences and particular adaptations, and between particular 
        adaptations and particular evolutionary lineages. Just how far he would 
        take this bias is evident in the following excerpt from "On the Habits 
        of the Orang-Utan of Borneo," an article published in 1856: 
        <blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...Do you mean to assert, 
          then, some of my readers will indignantly ask, that this animal, or 
          any animal, is provided with organs which are of no use to it? Yes, 
          we reply, we do mean to assert that many animals are provided with organs 
          and appendages which serve no material or physical purpose. The extraordinary 
          excrescences of many insects, the fantastic and many-coloured plumes 
          which adorn certain birds, the excessively developed horns in some of 
          the antelopes, the colours and infinitely modified forms of many flower-petals, 
          are all cases, for an explanation of which we must look to some general 
          principle far more recondite than a simple relation to the necessities 
          of the individual. We conceive it to be a most erroneous, a most contracted 
          view of the organic world, to believe that every part of an animal or 
          of a plant exists solely for some material and physical use to the individual,--to 
          believe that all the beauty, all the infinite combinations and changes 
          of form and structure should have the sole purpose and end of enabling 
          each animal to support its existence,--to believe, in fact, that we 
          know the one sole end and purpose of every modification that exists 
          in organic change, and to refuse to recognize the possibility of there 
          being any other. Naturalists are too apt to <i>imagine</i>, when they 
          cannot <i>discover</i>, a use for everything in nature... ...we believe 
          that the constant practice of imputing, right or wrong, some use to 
          the individual, of every part of its structure, and even of inculcating 
          the doctrine that every modification exists solely for some such use, 
          is an error fatal to our complete appreciation of all the variety, the 
          beauty, and the harmony of the organic world."</font></blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preceding words may come as something of a shock 
        to those who are used to thinking of Wallace in hyperselectionist terms. 
        One concludes from writings such as these (and there are some others that 
        can be pointed to) that Wallace was having trouble working out a process 
        model of evolutionary change because he had been unable to disabuse himself 
        of the notion that necessary utility of adaptations was a theoretical 
        dead-end leading to Creationism. When finally he did reassess his logic--with 
        the help of Malthus--to derive the theory of natural selection, he found 
        himself with a model that explained what he had thought for many years 
        to be impossible to explain: how all individual adaptations might be functional, 
        yet unpreordained. But the new model still could not explain how wholly 
        creative adaptations--that is, the "higher faculties" of humankind--could 
        come about. At best, the natural selection concept, with its survival 
        of the fittest tenet linked to environmental driving forces, could be 
        used to separate out that class of adaptive mechanisms that truly <i>was</i> 
        a reactive response from that class that was not. And thus, the following 
        early comments in the Ternate essay: 
        <blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...it is the object of the 
          present paper to show that [the] assumption ["that <i>varieties</i> 
          occurring in a state of nature are in all respects analogous to or even 
          identical with those of domestic animals, and are governed by the same 
          laws as regards their permanence or further variation"] is altogether 
          false, that there is a general principle in nature which will cause 
          many <i>varieties</i> to survive the parent species, and to give rise 
          to successive variations departing further and further from the original 
          type, and which also produces, in domesticated animals, the tendency 
          of varieties to return to the parent form."</font></blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that we need to take a closer look at the 
        wording of this essay, in particular its lack of mention of how humankind 
        might fit into the equation. This absence of mention has been interpreted 
        by historians such as Schwartz and Kottler as indicating that as of 1858 
        Wallace recognized no distinction between the evolutionary situation of 
        man and the rest of the living world, and therefore had not bothered to 
        draw man into the discussion. This being so, of course, it is easy enough 
        to conclude that Wallace's later treatments, which soon embraced preternatural 
        causal agents, constituted a 'change of mind' on his part. But it is at 
        least as reasonable to think that he kept man out of the 1858 discussion 
        deliberately. Certainly, he had been just as profoundly interested in 
        the evolutionary situation of humankind as he had other living things 
        (we know this from his letters to his confidante Bates); moreover, it 
        is clear that he had connected the historical biogeography model expressed 
        in 'On the Law...' to the development of the human species (from comments 
        made in several places, especially the aforementioned 'On the Habits of 
        the Orang-Utan of Borneo'). This leads me to suspect that he viewed his 
        1858 'law' as being something quite distinct from--not just an extension 
        of--his 1855 'law': distinct enough, in fact, that he was initially unwilling 
        to associate the lines of argument and evidence of the one with the other. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarize... Wallace's writings up to 1858 suggest 
          to me that he had adopted a rather unorthodox form of teleological thinking 
          in which evolution was viewed as proceeding in response to some final 
          cause whose global influence overrode biologically proximate causes. 
          In the years before 1858 he had not been deliberately searching for 
          a theoretical model of the proximate causes of organic change, largely 
          because this approach seemed to presuppose adaptational first causes. 
          The natural selection concept provided him with a proximate causes model, 
          but not one that could explain the emergence of uniquely human qualities. 
          Thus, Wallace's early reluctance to advance natural selection-based 
          explanations, and the later re-emergence in his writings of a global 
          evolutionary position, now embracing characteristics of human development.</p>

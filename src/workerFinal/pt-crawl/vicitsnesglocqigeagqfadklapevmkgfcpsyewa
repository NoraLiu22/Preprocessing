<h3> Welcome to the EDNA Insect Database, hosted by the Palaeontological Association.</h3>
<h4> <a href='search.php'>SEARCH PAGE</a> </h4>

<hr />

<p>EDNA, the fossil insect database, is designed to hold details of the holotypes of all the fossil insects in the world. The data comes from an exhaustive literature search and in the 2013 edition contains 26,200 species names [including synonyms] extracted from 5018 references.
The data is held in 38 fields, all of which are searchable, independently or in combination, and the output can contain any one or more as required.</p>

<p>Fields include: generic and specific names, citation, subfamily, family, superfamily, division, suborder and order:  Author, title, journal, and date of publication, and page on which the species is first described:  Time data including stage, epoch, subperiod, period and era and age [range] in millions of years: Bed, member, formation, and group: Site name, nearest feature [town, river etc] county, state, country and continent.
For all taxonomic ranks, citations can be included and both junior and senior synonyms displayed.  Natural History Museum London Library call numbers are also included.  </p>

<p>A $ symbol indicates some data is still to be found. After a specific name it usually means that some of the site, age or lithography data is missing.  After a higher taxonomic name, it indicates that the author and or date are missing. </p>
<p>Please report any incorrect or missing data to me at the link below.  PDFs of missing or $-marked journals gratefully received at <a href='mailto:aa.mitchell@btinternet.com'>aa.mitchell@btinternet.com</a></p>

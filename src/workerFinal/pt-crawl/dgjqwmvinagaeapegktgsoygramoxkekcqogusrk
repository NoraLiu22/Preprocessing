    <td>First Draft for Comment, 11 June 1992 <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>I wish here to pursue and extend the earlier explorations by Gills and Frank (1992)
    into the shape, expansion and cyclical behavior of what I contend was the world system
    during the bronze and iron ages. In so doing, I join and use the work of a number of
    archaeologists who are now applying or at least discussing &quot;world systems
    theory.&quot; It is a conceptual aid or framework for the reinterpretation of existing and
    newly unearthed information on bronze and iron age societies. As part of this task, the
    main intent here is to try to improve the mapping of the extent and the dating of the
    growth cycles of the bronze and iron age world system. To do so, I do not pretend to
    provide new information, but rather to systematize the only infrequently wide ranging
    systematic reviews and many more often scattered remarks on particular times and places of
    these same archaeologists and others. </p>
    <p>I have previously advanced the thesis that the present world system was born some 5,000
    years ago or earlier in West Asia, North Africa, and the Eastern Mediterranean (Frank
    1990, Gills and Frank 1990/91, 1992 and Frank and Gills 1992). The argument was similar to
    that of David Wilkinson (1987) who identified the birth of &quot;Central
    Civilization&quot; through the establishment of systemic and systematic relations between
    Egypt and Mesopotamia around 1500 BC. However, the date of the formation of the world
    system was pushed back farther to at least 3000 BC by analogy to the upstream confluence
    of two or more major branches to form a single river like the Mississippi-Missouri (Gills
    and Frank 1990/91). Moreover, we suggested that already in the third millennium BC the
    world system included not only Egypt and Mesopotamia. It also included the Arabian
    Peninsula, the Levant, Anatolia, Iran, the Indus Valley, Transcaucasia, and parts of
    Central Asia. All the regions were in direct &quot;bilateral,&quot; or at least chain-
    linked indirect &quot;multilateral,&quot; systematic and therefore systemic contact with
    each other (Gills and Frank 1992, Frank and Gills 1992). </p>
    <p>We also sought to identify &quot;World System Cycles, Crises and Hegemonial Shifts 1700
    BC to 1700 AD&quot; (Gills and Frank 1992). In a concluding summary table, we identified
    the cycles and expansive [A] and contractive/crisis [B] phases as follows: </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>B Phase: 1700 - 1500\1400 BC </td>
        <td>A Phase: 1400 - 1200 BC </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>B Phase: 1200 - 1000 BC </td>

    <p>On this occasion, I wish to confine my review and where necessary revision of the cycle
    dates only to the pre- Christian era bronze, iron and part classical age period. However,
    I also extend the identification of the cycles backward through or at least into the 3rd
    millennium BC. [The latest two millennia are reviewed separately and with little change to
    1700 AD in Frank and Gills (1992b) and with special reference to Central Asia in Frank
    (1992c) and extended to the present day with reference to Latin America in Frank (1992d)].
    </p>
    <p>Already in an &quot;Epilogue&quot; to the earlier Gills and Frank (1992) article
    written when it was already in press, I noted that David Wilkinson (1992) and Andrew
    Bosworth (1992) had proceeded independently of each other to test the existence and timing
    of our cycles [wich were proposed in a draft paper presented at professional meetings in
    1991]. Both used data from Tertius Chandler's (1987) census of growth and decline in city
    sizes. Both confirmed the existence and most but not all of the timing of our cycles. I
    also pointed to the dating of periods during the bronze age 1st millennium BC by Andrew
    and Susan Sherratt (1991), which coincided almost exactly with our dating of the up and
    down phases. Moreover, I referred to Kristian Kristiansen's (1992 and forthcoming) also
    similar dating of expansions and contractions in Europe during the 1st millennium BC, and
    to Klav Randsborg (1991) for the 1st millennium AD. </p>
    <p>Moreover, now I also have additional evidence available: Some systematic information on
    dates was already previously published for instance by George Dales (1976) on
    Iranian-Indus relations and by Shereen Ratnagar (1981) in a tabular summary of her study
    of the &quot;Encounters&quot; between the Indus Valley Harappa Civilization and points
    West. On these points West, some more partly systematic information is still unpublished
    by Christopher Edens and Philip Kohl (n.d.). E.N. Chernykh (n.d.) proposes cycle datings
    for most of Eurasia in his Russian language Ancient Metallurgy in the USSR: The Early
    Metal Age, whose English language translation is still unpublished. Other references to
    more or less precise dates of especially economic expansions and contractions here and
    there are scattered through previous and new works of various other archaeologists and
    others. Because of the gap betwen their expertise and mine, I often prefer to let thejm
    speak for themselves by quoting them directly, instead of my trying to convey the same in
    my own inexpert way. </p>
    <p>I draw on this information below in the attempt to [re]assemble the jig saw puzzle
    picture of the changing extent and cyclical development of the world system in the bronze
    and iron ages. However, this jigsaw puzzle assembly differs from the usual kind in several
    ways that make it much more difficult: 1. the number of pieces in &quot;the box&quot; is
    indeterminate, indeed infinite [if cut small enough]; and it is possible to place or
    assemble only a few of them here. 2. There is no original design or intended final picture
    on top of &quot;the box&quot; to guide the assembly. 3. It is not possible to follow the
    usual easier procedure of beginning the assembly with pieces that have at least one
    straight line, which help define the outer margin of the picture. In this case on the
    contrary, it is the very outer margin that is most difficult to define; and it seems
    easiest to begin with some pieces that appear to be in the better known &quot;core.&quot;
    4. The task is not a one time enterprise. The shape of the pieces themselves and their
    [core-periphery and hegemonic] fit with their neighbors changes constantly over time.
    Perhaps this change us near- randomly; perhaps it also ocurrs in cycles that should also
    be identified. 5. One the principal tasks, indeed the main intent here below, is to
    [re]define such cycles. </p>
    <p>Before so proceeding however, I wish briefly to review and take position in two
    underlying theoretical debates about bronze and iron age economies and world-systems [and
    their jigsaw puzzle design and assembly]. </p>
    <h4>The &quot;Ancient Economy&quot; Debate</h4>
    <p>We may distinguish a debate about the &quot;extent of the market&quot; [to recall Adam
    Smith's phrase that related it to the &quot;division of labor&quot;] in ancient economy.
    There is also a related discussion about the applicability &quot;world systems&quot;
    theory or concepts to this economy. Other recent reviews by Kohl (1989), Edens and Kohl
    (n.d.), Woolf (1990) and Sherratt (1991) of both discussions would make still another
    extensive treatment of the same here superfluous. Indeed, theirs were really reviews in
    turn of already lengthy reviews of the first debate by Silver (1985) and others. In the
    first debate, Edens and Kohl distinguish the following positions: Among historians, the
    primitivists like Weber [and more recently Finley] vs. the modernists like Meyer. Among
    anthropologists, the substantivists headed by Polanyi and his defenders who are joined in
    an intermediary position by Renfrew and his followers among archaeologists who see some
    pass-me-on chain- linked down-the-line trade, vs. the formalists like Herskovits [and
    ...], who argue that the market existed and/or modern economic analysis is applicable to
    ancient economy. The primitivist/ institutionalist/ substantivist denial by Weber,
    Polanyi, Finley, Renfrew and indeed by Marx before them of the importance of market
    relations, and a forteriori of capital accumulation, and of the significance of long
    distance trade in the ancient world had already been challenged de facto long ago. Among
    historians, Weber's contemporary Werner Sombart (1967,1969) did so, and then so did Gordon
    Chile (1936, 1942) among archaeologists. Yet even Childe &quot;consistently
    underestimated&quot; the strength of the opposite case, according to Kohl (1987).
    Moreover, in a posthumously published essay even Polanyi (1975,1977) wrote that
    &quot;throughout, the external origin of trade is conspicuous; internal trade is largely
    derivative of external trade ...either from ... (status motive)- or for the sake of
    gain...(profit motive)&quot; (Polanyi 1975: 154,136-7). </p>
    <p>In the 1970s, archaeologists rejected the earlier Polanyi/Finley views and offered
    reinterpretations of increasingly available data in the pathbreaking &quot;Anthropological
    Perspectives on Ancient Trade&quot; by Robert Adams (1974) and &quot;Third Millennium
    Modes of Exchange and Modes of Production&quot; by C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky (1975). About
    the same time, H.W.W. Crawford (1973:273) had also observed &quot;increasing evidence for
    private ownership of land, property and therefore capital&quot; and suggested that temples
    may have acted as banks. </p>
    <p>Since then, the empirical and analytical refutation of the primitivist-substantivist
    argument has been almost unceasing. The evidence -- more through the record of
    archaeological finds than through surviving literary texts -- has been substantial. The
    related arguments about the importance in and for ancient economy of very long distance
    trade, market relations, demand and supply related price formation, monetization,
    entrepreneurship, yes and capital accumulation have been so overwhelming that we can at
    best only point to some of the tip of the iceberg. Among the more conceptual writings are
    those of Kajsa Ekholm (1980), Ekholm and Friedman (1982), Rowlands, Larsen and Kristiansen
    (1987), Philip Kohl (1987, 1989, 1991), and Christopher Edens and Kohl (n.d.). The more
    empirical reviews include those by George Dales (1976), Shereen Ratnagar (1981), C.C.
    Lamberg-Karlovsky (19xx), and too many others to recount. However in this regard, Edens
    and Kohl (n.d.) also refer to Powell (1977), Foster (1977), Gledhill &amp; Larsen (1982),
    Zagrell (1986), and Charpin (19xx). In these debates, I must take sides with the
    anti-primitivist &quot;marketeers.&quot; latter. This view may be summarized by
    Lamberg-Karlovsky's (1975) early explicit rejection of the Polanyi position on the role of
    &quot;profit, price-fixing, wholesaling, supply-demand, or even private ownership of land
    for surplus production....It is the central thesis ... that all of these existed in a
    market network at least by the end of the fourth millennium in Mesopotamia.&quot; Many
    records from the 3rd and 2nd millennia also attest to fluctuations in the prices of gold
    and silver relative to each other as well as over both long and short terms to land,
    slaves, grains, oil, and wages which also changed relative to each other. If these price
    changes did not directly respond to supply and demand, they did so through administered
    prices, which also had to respond at least politically to supply and demand. Moreover,
    &quot;evidence is abundant of the accumulation of human and material capital, including
    circulating capital not directly involved in the production process ... and fixed
    capital&quot; (Silver 1985:163). Documentation from late 3r and early 2nd millennium
    Mesopotamia analyzed by Mogens Larsen (1987) suggests that public and private accumulation
    were both simultaneously complementary and that each replaced the other in relative
    importance back and forth over time. I might suggest that they probably also did so over
    less and more prosperous phases of the economic cycle. </p>
    <p>The refutation of Polanyi and Finley about the importance of market relations as well
    as the market places he recognized at the local level was one thing. The recognition of
    the related vital importance of long distance trade and trading networks, beyond Polanyi's
    local markets and Renfrew's hand- me-down non-trade was another thing. Robert Adams (1974:
    247,248) found &quot;little doubt that long-distance trade was a formidable socio-economic
    force&quot; and also that &quot;we have wrongly deprecated the entrepreneurial element in
    the historical development of at least the more complex societies.&quot; Indeed as
    observed above, even Polanyi himself came to say that internal trade was largely
    derivative from external trade. Moreover, as Kohl (1989:228) remarks, &quot;the
    intercultural trade that developed between resource-poor southern Mesopotamia and
    resource-rich highland areas of Anatolia and Iran necessarily transformed the productive
    [and political, social and cultural, in a word civilizational state formation?] activities
    of all societies participating in the exchange network without the development of an
    overarching polity or empire.&quot; </p>
    <h4>Center-Periphery and World-System/s Theory</h4>
    <p>Some more conceptual writers among the &quot;marketeers&quot; and &quot;long-distance
    traders&quot; have also sought recourse to at least some aspects of
    &quot;world-systems&quot; theory. Thus, a new wave in archaeological studies has recently
    appeared. It applies center-periphery and/or world systems analysis to the study of
    complex societies of the past. Rowlands, Larsen and Kristiansen, Eds. (1987) entitled a
    book Centre and Periphery in the Ancient World; Champion (198x) edited one on Centre and
    Periphery: Comparative Studies in Archeology; Chase-Dunn and Hall 1991 on Pre-Capitalist
    Core-Periphery Relations; Guillermo Algaze (n.d.) compares several &quot;Prehistoric World
    Systems, Imperialism, and the Expansion of some Early Pristine States;&quot; Mitchell
    Allen (1986) discusses &quot;Assyrian Colonies in Anatolia: A World System
    Perspective;&quot; Greg Woolf (1990) discusses &quot;World-systems analysis and the Roman
    Empire,&quot; and Andrew Sherratt writes of &quot;Core, Periphery, and Margin:
    Perspectives on the Bronze Age&quot; (n.d.) and asks &quot;What Would a Bronze Age World
    System Look Like?&quot; (1992). </p>
    <p>A half century earlier, Gordon Childe had already written that &quot;if the economy of
    the Early Bronze Age cities could not expand internally, owing to the over-concentration
    of purchasing power ... the urban economy must - and did - expand externally&quot; (Childe
    1942:139). The center sought &quot;to persuade their possessors to exchange the needed raw
    materials for manufactures&quot;. According to Childe this trade was from the beginning a
    political trade between elites in the center and elites in the periphery, in which the
    center sought to induce the periphery to render up a surplus. That is how Childe explained
    for instance the commercial ventures and associated military campaigns of the Akkadian
    King Sargon I in 2350 BC. </p>
    <p>Recent excavation at Habuba Kabira in northern Syria of a south Mesopotamian colony
    &quot;represents a deliberate Lower Mesopotamian penetration up the Euphrates ... to
    secure direct control of vital raw materials and luxuries from the Syrio- Anatolian
    regions and to regulate exchange of goods from the east and south-east passing this
    way&quot; (Moorey 1987:44). </p>
    <p>More recently, Frederik Hiebert and C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky (1991),for instance, write
    of </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Egyptian 'colonies' in Palestine, the Uruk 'colonies' in northern Syria, the
      Proto-Elamite 'colonies' on the Iranian Plateau, and the Indus 'colony' at Shortugai as
      examples of 'core' regions having a direct impact upon a distant 'periphery.' The almost
      universal 'explanation' offered for the existence of these 'colonies' has focused upon the
      need to control and exploit distant resources and trade routes. This is, however, only a
      partial explanation of the complexity involved. Areas of cultural complexity are
      constantly confronted by both and internal and external competition that extend beyond the
      need for resources. Increasing energy expenditures for maintaining an administrative
      bureaucracy, establishing networks of communication, increasing agricultural and commodity
      production, as well as sustaining the costs involved in local conflicts, which inevitably
      emerge in efforts toward centralization, could all lead to expansionist tendencies.... On
      ancient societies, dependent as they are entirely upon human, animal and plant
      productivity, the solution to declining marginal returns can be accomplished by
      territorial expansion and the exploitation of new resources, land, people, etc.... The
      Central Asian Bronze Age joins the community of Bronze Age civilizations in replicating
      this process of expanding into a distant periphery (Frederik Hiebert and C.C.
      Lamberg-Karlovsky 1991:Ms. without pp.). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, many of these recent appeals to center-periphery categories and to the
    world-systems or the world system itself are only hinking or halting. Some engage in
    seemingly arcane discussions with Wallerstein (1974), who never claimed and indeed denies
    (1991) that his &quot;modern world-system&quot; and its most significant characteristics
    extend back beyond 1450 AD. Thus, Greg Woolf's (1990) examination of the Roman empire
    seems to get lost in Wallerstein's distinctions between world- systems and world empires,
    which I regard as more misleading than clarifying. Notwithstanding their title, Rowlands,
    Larsen and Kristiansen (1987) is replete with assertions about the limitations and doubts
    about the utility of core-periphery analysis. [The two last named had however become more
    enthusiastic about world system categories by 1992, at conferences where they presented
    papers at panels with the present author. Titles by Kristiansen (1992 and forthcoming)
    refer to &quot;The European World System in the Bronze Age&quot;]. </p>
    <p>Philip Kohl (1989) invokes the &quot;Use and Abuse of World Systems Theory,&quot; only
    to argue that &quot;nowhere in the ancient world may one properly speak of 'world'
    structures of unequal exchange, of 'world' labor markets, or of economic dependence and
    underdevelopment&quot; (Edens and Kohl n.d.:4). In particular, Kohl emphasizes that
    manufacturing cores had no special advantages, and especially no technological monopoly,
    over raw materials exporting peripheries. Therefore, in several publications he also takes
    special pains to deny any &quot;development of underdevelopment&quot; (Frank 1966) in the
    ancient world (Kohl 1987, 1989, 1991, 1992, Edens &amp; Kohl, n.d.). However, as Kajsa
    Ekholm and Jonathan Friedman (1982:90-91) pointed out &quot;center/periphery relations are
    not necessarily defined in terms of their [raw material-manufactures] import-export
    pattern.... Center/periphery relations refer, rather, to different structural positions
    with respect to total accumulation&quot; of capital, from which they derive differential
    advantages and disadvantages. Nonetheless, Kohl is among those who most demonstrate the de
    facto existence, albeit with multiple and shifting cores, peripheries and hinterlands, of
    &quot;the West Asian Early Bronze Age world system described here&quot; (Edens and Kohl
    n.d. 59 &amp; 60). </p>
    <p>This shadow boxing with non-existent opponents who might but do not make claims to the
    total sameness of the modern and ancient world system seems less than fruitful. It seems
    better just to use world system categories where and when they can help clarify the
    &quot;reality&quot; of the ancient world. Gills and Frank (1992) emphasized that through
    most of history and a forteriori pre-history there have been sets of interlinking
    hegemonic cores with their respective peripheries and hinterland/s. However, several cores
    seem to have experienced synchronized nearly simultaneous [cyclical?] ups and downs; and
    the downs often led to shifts of hegemony to other, sometimes recently emerged, cores.
    Moreover, following our still earlier essay, we defined hegemony as a &quot;hierarchical
    structure of the accumulation of surplus among political entities, and their constituent
    classes, mediated by force. A hierarchy of centers of accumulation and polities is
    established that apportions a privileged share of surplus, and the political economic
    power to this end, to the hegemonic centre/state and its ruling/propertied classes&quot;
    (Gills and Frank 1990/91). To highlight these relations, we selected as one of our
    epigraphs the following observations by the archaeologist Michael Rowlands: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It has not been sufficiently appreciated that a theory of cyclical change also includes
      a theory of shifts of centres in space. In other words, expansion and contraction
      processes have rarely been stable.... This may involve intra-regional shifts in influence
      between competing centres within a single core area ... [and also] oscillations in
      intra-core hegemony are interspersed by much larger scale shifts in arrangements of
      centres and their peripheries.... It is ultimately the temporal that is seen to dominate
      over the spatial shifts in the waxing and waning of particular centres. This is generally
      true of all the long cycle theories (Rowlands 1987:xx). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So this paper, following on Gills and Frank (1992), explores - - if perhaps not a
    &quot;theory&quot; -- some evidence of long cycles and spatial shifts in the waxing and
    waning of particular centers in the bronze and iron age world system. </p>
    <p>Important here is in the distinction between various ancient world-systems, of which
    for instance Algaze (n.d.) includes two in what is now West Asia/the Middle East, and the
    one &quot;Central World System,&quot; as Chase-Dunn and Hall (1991) recommend we call it
    by combining the denominations of Frank and Gills, and Wilkinson. All the last named
    insist that there has been an unbroken historical continuity between this bronze age
    Central Civilization/World System and our contemporary &quot;Modern Capitalist
    World-System.&quot; To coin a phrase, it is the same system, but it is not the same
    insofar as there have been some changes and perhaps even development/s. </p>
    <p>I argue that this continuous same one world system is characterized by at least the
    following characteristics since bronze age times: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>- 1. The world system itself. Per contra Wallerstein (1974), we believe that the
      existence and development of the same world system in which we live stretches back at
      least five thousand years (Frank 1990a, 1991a,b; Gills and Frank 1990/91, 1992; Frank and
      Gills 1992). Wallerstein emphasizes the difference a hyphen [-] makes. Unlike our nearly
      World [wide] System, World-Systems are in a &quot;world&quot; of their own, which need not
      be even nearly world wide. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>- 2. The process of capital accumulation as the motor force of [world system] history.
      Wallerstein and others regard continuous capital accumulation as the differentia specifica
      of the &quot;modern world-system.&quot; We have argued elsewhere that in this regard the
      &quot;modern&quot; world system is not so different and that this same process of capital
      accumulation has played a, if not the, central role in the world system for several
      millennia ( Frank 1991b and Gills and Frank 1990/91). Amin (1991) and Wallerstein (1991)
      disagree. They argue that previous world-systems were what Amin calls
      &quot;tributary&quot; or Wallerstein &quot;world empires.&quot; In these, Amin claims that
      politics and ideology were in command, not the economic law of value in the accumulation
      of capital. Wallerstein seems to agree. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>- 3. The center-periphery structure in and of the world [system]. This structure is
      familiar to analysts of dependence in the &quot;modern&quot; world system and especially
      in Latin America since 1492. It includes but is not limited to the transfer of surplus
      between zones of the world system. Frank (1967, 1969) wrote about this among others.
      However, we now find that this analytical category is also applicable to the world system

      by Wallerstein (1979), or since 1494 by Modelski (1987) and by Modelski and Thompson

      That is, an important characteristic of the &quot;modern&quot; world system is that the
      process of capital accumulation, changes in center-periphery position within it, and world
      system hegemony and rivalry are all cyclical and occur in tandem with each other. Frank
      analyzed the same for the &quot;modern&quot; world system under the title World
      Accumulation 1492-1789 and Dependent Accumulation and Underdevelopment (Frank 1978a,b).
      However, we now find that this same world system cycle and its features also extends back
      many centuries before 1492 (Frank 1992d, Frank and Gills 1992). </p>

    <p>Indeed, this same long cyclical pattern of ascending and descending phases extends back
    at least through the 3rd millennium BC in the bronze age. </p>
    <h3>THE BRONZE AGE WORLD SYSTEM AND ITS CYCLES IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM BC</h3>
    <h4>The Extent of the World System</h4>
    <p>Edens and Kohl write </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>One must define the spatial parameters of one's world system, while at the same time
      emphasize that the procedure is to some extent artificial in that the system's borders
      were never hermetically sealed and that they expanded or contracted over time. This
      difficulty affects the analysis presented above [here below] (Edens and Kohl, n.d.:58). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The farther back we go in [pre]history, not surprisingly, the more difficult it becomes
    to identify the changing geographical extent and temporal cycle of expansion and
    contraction of the world system with any kind of confidence. The at least chain-linked
    interaction has to be great enough so that changes in one part of the whole also affect
    other parts of the whole. Also, the phases have to be more or less common to enough
    diverse areas to say that they participated in a single system, which later became world
    embracing. </p>
    <p>One of the important questions -- also here below -- is when and how, not to mention
    why, this &quot;central world system&quot; grows and changes during the bronze age and
    then expands during the iron age to include considerably larger areas -- but which? --
    well beyond the political confines of the Achaemenid empire. Another and prior question is
    when, where, and how this bronze age world system came into being. Leon Marfoe (1987)
    addresses part of this question in his analysis of the emergence of the
    Egypt-Levant-Syria-Anatolia axis and its extension to Arabia, Mesopotamia and Iran from
    the 5th and in the 4th and 3rd millennia. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>During a short time around 3000 BC, apparently sophisticated, complex systems ...
      appeared across an area stretching from the Nile and Aegean in the west to central Asia in
      the east. It is not impossible that these regional developments may represent a loosely
      integrated and related series of changes...that may in part be attributable to an
      interplay between local and external forces. In this regard, one possible effect of their
      outcome may have been a 'primitive accumulation of capital' and its role as a force for
      such change. Such conclusion would include a measure of 'market forces' in these
      periods....Between the late fourth and third millennia, a faint, highly buffered 'market
      mechanisms' may have operated for different periods of time and in different regions along
      these networks (Marfoe 1987:25,30,34 in Rowlands ed.) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the same volume edited by Rowlands, Larsen and Kristiansen, P.R.S. Moorey (1987)
    pursues the 4th millennium trail from Mesopotamia, via Syria into Egypt, which he notes
    scholars were already aware of over a century ago. Moorey analyzes at least indirect
    mid-4th millennium exchange via Syria of Gerzean period Egyptian gold for oil, silver and
    lapis lazuri from Mesopotamia, which must have received the latter from farther afield in
    turn. He also asks, but on present evidence is unable to answer, whether and to what
    extent this long- distance exchange altered the productive activities in Egypt. However,
    he notes the boon to power and status of those who controlled the distribution of imported
    luxury items through local exchange networks even before the Gerzean period. </p>
    <p>Thus, relations among otherwise distinctive regions have left marks in the
    archaeological record from the 4th and even the 5th and perhaps earlier millennia BC. Many
    were ecologically based on differences and complementarities in natural resource
    endowments, which generated trade, migration, invasion, and in general diffusion. Kohl
    (1978:475) asks rhetorically if the &quot;world&quot; system already stretched from the
    Balkans and the Nile to the Indus in the 4th millennium; and in her comment on Kohl, Joan
    Oates (1978:481) reads the archaeological record to display &quot;international&quot;
    horizons from at least the middle of the 5th millennium BC onwards. However, it is
    difficult or impossible yet to maintain that these relations were systematic enough to be
    called systemic. Nor is there [yet?] sufficient evidence to identify an interregional
    growth cycle of any significance among them. </p>
    <p>Edens and Kohl answer their own above cited admonition to define the spatial parameters
    of the world system: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Roughly, the area stretches from the eastern Mediterranean in the west to the Indus
      valley in the east and from southern Central Asia and the great Caucasus range in the
      north to the Sudan and Arabian peninsula in the south....Intriguingly and perhaps not
      entirely accidentally, [a millennium later] the political borders of the Achaemenid
      empire, including those areas, like mainland Greece, where the Persians expanded, coincide
      fairly closely with the limits of the West Asian Early Bronze Age world system (Edens
      &amp; Kohl n.d.:58-59). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These limits of the bronze age world system also coincide fairly closely with those set
    out in Gills and Frank (1990/91, 1992) and in Frank and Gills (1992). </p>
    <p>However, in his tour de force on Ancient Metallurgy in the USSR: The Early Metal Age
    [EMA], E.N. Chernykh (n.d.) argues, as per Kohl's &quot;Introduction,&quot; that the
    development of metallurgy was an increasingly interconnected and shared process throughout
    most of Eurasia. &quot;The world system itself has turned out to be far more extensive
    than appeared earlier,&quot; (Chernykh n.d.:369) concludes in a fleeting - apparently
    afterthought - reference to &quot;world system.&quot; Nonetheless, already in his foreword
    he also suggests that &quot;from at least the fifth millennium BC until the third
    millennium BC, the peoples of the EMA cultural zone seem to have shared the same
    developmental cycle: the formation and decline of cultures at various levels generally
    coincided&quot; (p. 2). In his closing chapter, he returns to &quot;the contemporaneity of
    the decline and formation of various systems over the vast expanse of Eurasia and the Old
    World as a whole...[when] a whole chain of similar systems arose almost simultaneously,
    from the Atlantic to the Pacific: the European, Eurasian, Caucasian and Central Asian
    provinces, along with others outside the USSR&quot; (365). </p>
    <p>In the 5th and 4th millennia BC already there was &quot;highly developed commercial
    exchange&quot; and the export of &quot;huge quantities&quot; of copper and gold from
    mining and metallurgical centers in Thrace and the Carpatho-Balkan region to oreless
    consuming regions in Moldavia, the Western Ukraine, the Dnieper and on to the Volga.
    However, from the middle or second half of the 4th millennium &quot;an extensive chain of
    Copper Age culture began to break up.&quot; With the significant drop of metal production
    in the early bronze age, the &quot;disappearance [of this complex]...and replacement of a
    culture ... was as unexpected as its appearance&quot; (87-93). Kohl (1984) also suggests
    elsewhere that the archaeological record bespeaks some form of pre-historic &quot;silk
    route&quot; connection to China two thousand years before the classical one. Chinese
    scholars also refer to the same even earlier at their end (cited in Frank 1992c). </p>
    <p>This rather more extensive rendition of the extent of the world system already in the
    early-middle bronze age is also similar to my own suggestion about the &quot;Centrality of
    Central Asia&quot; and its Silk Road in the formation, development and operation of this
    world system (Frank 1992c). Much of the development of the outlying civilizations in
    China, India, Persia, Mesopotamia, Europe, etc. can only be accounted for and understood
    through their relations with the peoples of Central Asia, many of whom moreover, migrated
    to into East, South and West [Eur] Asia. One of its theses was that we should not regard
    the emergence of Central Asian waves of migration, often also bringing with them
    technological advances in productive and warfare techniques, as Deus ex Machina intrusions
    on &quot;civilized&quot; societies around Central Asia. The &quot;Pulse of Asia,&quot; to
    recall the phrase of Huntington (1907), may be in its center (Frank 1992c). Nonetheless,
    the Centrality of Central Asia is all too neglected -- also in my own examination of the
    geographical extent and temporal cycles of the world system below! </p>
    <p>Of course, our picture of the world system must be derived from survival of textual and
    the excavation of archaeological evidence. However, beyond the vagaries of what did and
    did not survive, the pattern of archaeological digs and their analysis is also a function
    of our own contemporary economic, cultural and political vagaries. Thus, Kohl (1984)
    remarks, for instance, on the Soviet focus on sites rather than regions [to which the
    below much cited E.N. Chernykh is a remarkable recent exception] and their preferential
    access to sites on the territory of the [former] USSR. This lets regions south of their
    borders fall through today's political economic cracks with little notice, however
    important their participation may also have been in our world system. Moreover, my own
    puzzle[d?] assembly below relies more on &quot;economic&quot; trade based than
    &quot;political&quot; warfare, &quot;social&quot; migration, and/or &quot;cultural&quot;
    diffusion based pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The archaeological record, or at least the
    documentation more available to me, more readily permits the assembly of jig saw puzzle
    pieces of the early bronze age trading network/s in the West Asian world system. Yet even
    then, only very few of these pieces can be assembled here. </p>
    <p>Kohl (1989:227) notes that &quot;profit-motivated trade extended far beyond the
    political borders of any state and connected ... [all of these] into a single world
    system.&quot; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Foreign trade in the mid-3rd millennium was an exceedingly complex process, involving
      the movement of finished luxury commodities, raw materials, and staple products, and was
      probably conducted both by state agents and by private entrepreneurs....It does show that
      developments in southwestern Asia were not limited to the alluvial plains and that widely
      separated communities were linked by complex, well-defined exchange networks (Kohl 1978:
      466). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The alluvial plains of Mesopotamia are and were notoriously poor in metals and timber,
    which they had to import from often very distant sources. Following Larsen (1967),
    Mitchell Allen (1986) draws a map centered on Assur. It imported gold and silver from
    Anatolia and tin and other metals from Afghanistan. In turn, Assur exported textiles to
    both and re- exported Central Asian Afghani and/or Iranian tin to Anatolia. However, Assur
    also imported textiles and perhaps grain, mainly wheat and barley, from southern
    Mesopotamia and paid for it with gold, silver and other metals imported from Anatolia and
    Afghanistan. </p>
    <p>Shereen Ratnagar (1981) concentrates on the trade relations between Mesopotamia and the
    Indus Valley but also discusses some other trade. She discusses partly administered and
    partly free-lance trade. Copper came from Cyprus and the Levant as well as Oman, Iran and
    Afghanistan. As already mentioned, the rarer tin came from Anatolia, the Caucasus and
    Iran. Scattered copper, tin, lead and zinc as well as gold ores also were sources of
    silver, which was rarely available alone, but whose main source was Anatolia according to
    Marfoe (1987). Wood came from Meluhha on the Indus, Magan in Oman and Dilmun at Bahrain,
    as well as the Siwaliks and Punjab regions. As is well known, Egypt imported wood from the
    Levant. Egypt and/or Nubia in turn were a major source of gold, which was also exported
    from Arabia, Armenia, and probably the Indus. The latter exported timber, copper, gold,
    ivory, stones and beads to Mesopotamia and imported food, textiles, silver and
    earthenware. Earthenware steatite vessels were the most widely traded item, apparently
    both as a container of other goods and as a trade item in itself. However, Ratnagar
    observes that pottery did not travel over very long distances, presumably because of its
    weight, which made cloth and reed containers more suitable. </p>
    <p>Ratnagar also itemizes trade in precocities like ivory, steatite, carnelian beads,
    dice, bird figurines, conch shells, monkey figurines, pearls, and lapis lazuli, the latter
    from a single source in Afghanistan. Trade in silver seems to have had a special role as a
    currency medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. Archaeological finds of
    weights and seals from distant locations also attest to widespread trading networks, using
    overland, riverine, coastal and sea transport, individually and in combination. Evidence
    survives of individual shipments of 20 tons of copper, and exports from Assur to one small
    town has been estimated at some 100,000 textiles over a 50 year period. </p>
    <p>As already noted above, Chernykh (n.d.) examines interconnected but shifting
    predominantly east-west trade nets of metals and their products across much of Eurasia
    north of the mountain ranges. As we will note below, they include a 1,000 km long tin
    trade route in the mid-2nd millennium. However [and despite the political confinement of
    his research to the fomer USSR], he also gives at least some glimpses of earlier
    north-south trade relations into Anatolia, Iran, and Afghanistan across the mountains.
    These, in turn, link the northern Eur-Asian trading and migratory system into the West
    Asian, Gulf, Arabian, and North African one/s. <small>(ADD MORE, eg CENTRAL ASIA FROM
    CHERNYKH AND/OR TRADE NET MAP?) </small></p>
    <h4>The Cycle[s] in the 3rd Millennium BC</h4>
    <p>Like Gills and Frank (1990/91, 1992), Edens and Kohl suggest that a major criterion of
    participation in a single world system is near simultaneity or synchronism of [cyclical?]
    expansion and contraction, which </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>suggests the action of an interrelated set of transregional social forces operative
      over vast regions of western Asia from the mid-3rd through the mid-2nd millennium BC....
      The existence of an ancient world system is postulated by the largely synchronous
      processes of rise and collapse recorded throughout this area; it is difficult to deny that
      one here is witnessing historically connected processes ... [in] the world system&quot;
      (Edens &amp; Kohl n.d.:25,61). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Gills and Frank (1992) identified such simultaneous expansive [A] and contractive [B]
    phases beginning with a B phase from 1700 to 1500/1400 BC. Of course, this implied the
    existence of a still unidentified A phase before 1700 BC; and we expressed the hope later
    to be able also to identify such cycle phases through the 3rd millennium BC. </p>
    <p>More evidence for simultaneously phased expansions and renewed contractions in the 3rd
    millennium BC is available. The millennium opens with another of the periodic 200 year
    long waves of migration out of Central Asia between 3000 and 2800 BC, which was remarked
    on among others by Gimbutas (Frank 1992c). Periods [or cyclical phases?] of economic
    expansion and contraction are evident particularly for the Mesopotamian lowland-Iranian
    highland, where especially Sumer-Elam geo- political rivalry was an [also cyclical?]
    constant. For instance, findings of shell lamp/cups at Ur and Kish in Mesopotamia peak
    during ED II and III, that is about 2700 to 2400 BC and decline sharply thereafter
    &quot;within the general trend of reduced uses of shell products in southern Mesopotamia
    late in the 3rd millennium and later&quot; (Edens and Kohl n.d.:8). Elsewhere, Kohl (1978)
    quotes A.L. Oppenheim's earlier observations about Ur to the effect that in the late 3rd
    millennium &quot;a process of gradual and slow restriction of the geographical horizon
    marks the entire development of commercial connections. We may well assume that the
    frequency and intensity of contact had reached a peak early in the third millennium
    B.C.&quot; (Oppenheim 1954:12). Jawad (1965) insists on the ecological, economic, social
    and political differences of northern from southern Mesopotamia at this time, which
    however were apparently not sufficient to exclude the North from this same [cyclical?]
    process. </p>
    <p>Indeed, Edens and Kohl note that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>numerous commentators have observed a set of fundamental synchronisms across much of
      western Asia ... in eastern Iran, Central Asia and the Indus ... in the mid 3rd millennium
      BC; [and] the collapse of these expressions of urban complex society, now extending
      throughout Iran, into the Gulf and, in a modified way, also southern Mesopotamia, but the
      opening centuries of the 2nd millennium BC (Edens &amp; Kohl n.d.:23-24). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>They note that in the Indus area massive urban growth occurred 2600/2500 BC, and even
    more spectacular decline around or after 2000 BC. Urbanization in Southern Turkmenistan
    2600-2200 was followed by population shifts or dispersion eastward from there and other
    Transcaucasian areas. Urbanization in Southern Afghanistan also culminated after 2500 and
    abruptly disappeared after 2000 BC. Settlement in southwestern and southern Iranian peaked
    around and/or declined after the second half of the 3rd millennium. In and around Oman on
    the Arabian peninsula peak copper production, best documented at the Maysar I site, was
    late in the 3rd millennium. In the Gulf region, settlement and economic activity seems to
    have shifted from the Arabian coast to Bahrain and is evidenced by the growth of Qala' to
    some 5,000 population also eating Indian rice and the export of grain staples from
    Mesopotamia to Dilmun in the closing three centuries of the millennium. Harriet Crawford
    (1991:150) suggests that Gulf states' mercantile rivalry in and for the carrying trade
    between Sumer and Omani copper as well as with Meluhha may help explain this shift. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>'International' relations changed over the greater Middle East during the first half of
      the third millennium with, the collapse of the proto-Elamite 'hegemony' in southern and
      Central Iran...&quot; according to archaeological evidence from Central Asia, Baluchistan,
      southeastern Iran and the Indus Valley...accross the Iranian plateau, in the Gulf area
      (particularly the Oman peninsula), Mesopotamia, the Anatolian plateau and the Caucasus....
      But it is unclear what happened to foreign relations in the later third and early second
      millennia with the collapse of Akkadian rule and the subsequent rise of and demise of the
      highly centralized Ur III dynasty. Dales (1977) explained the collapse of proto-urban
      settlements throughout the Indo-Iranian borderlands (during the so- called urban phase) as
      due to the cessation of long- distance overland trade and development of direct maritime
      trade between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. His theory only represents an unproven
      hypothesis but deserves serious consideration (Kohl 1984:242). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Dales (1976) finds a definite rhythm in &quot;The Shifting Trade Patterns between the
    Iranian Plateau and the Indus Valley in the Third Millennium B.C.&quot; He refers to
    widespread abandonment of sites from Central Asia through Sistan, southern Afghanistan and
    northern Baluchistan and an almost total break in trade routes and spheres of interaction
    across their trade routes and then a shift also of maritime trade patterns around 2500 BC.
    However, the &quot;phase marker&quot; was not absolutely synchronized but had a
    &quot;sloping horizon&quot; from earlier to later, moving from West Asia to Central Asia
    and the Indus Valley. Strong trade and cultural interaction between Central Asia, northern
    Pakistan, eastern Persia, and points west characterized the first half of the 3rd
    millennium. For instance, the Turkemnian Alty Tepe flourished, but then declined in the
    late 3rd millennium. At the same time, the Afghan Sistan site at Shar-i Sokhta was
    destroyed and abandoned in the 3rd millennium, if only because the main stream of the
    Helmand River changed course [but see and alternative explanation below]. Its Helmand
    Valley civilization &quot;totally collapsed by 2500 BC.&quot; However, the reasons may
    also have been transregional. For in summary, the three regions of Turkmenia, souther
    Afghanistan including Sistan, and the Indus Valley had &quot;widespread contacts and
    interdependencies from the end of the 4th to the middle of the 3rd millennium, after which
    &quot;they went their own ways.&quot; Until then, also &quot;formal maritime trading
    activities were being conducted between the Indus Valley and southern Mesopotamia via the
    Persian Gulf,&quot; in which the Kulli, the closest westerly neighbors of the Indus Valley
    Harappa, appear to have played a middle man role. </p>
    <p>The Kulli also pay this role in Shereen Ratnagar's (1981) account of Encounters: The
    Westerly Trade of the Harappa Civilisation. In her Table 4.4 on p. 213, she summarizes the
    &quot;relative chronology of the third millennium&quot; for each of the sites/regions of
    Barbar, Umm An Nar, Shahdad, Yahya, Shahr-i- Sokhta, Bampir V-VII, Kulli, and Harappa. The
    respective periods of maximum recorded activity in her table begins between the
    Mesopotamian periods ED I and II in 2750 for each of these sites/regions except
    Shahr-i-Sokhta and Harappa, where they begin about one to one and a half centuries later.
    The endings of the periods of activity marked by solid lines on her table, followed by
    dotted lines ending in question marks, fall mostly within the Mesopotamian ED III period.
    In five of these sites/ regions, the fall off date is between 2450 and 2350, the latter
    for Kulli already in the Akkadian period. For the others, the period of decline, followed
    by a question mark culminates between the Akkadian and post- Akkadian periods around 2250
    BC. Only Harappa continues until 2000 or perhaps even 1800 and Barbar until 1800 BC.
    However, &quot;the archaeologically attested trade contacts of the Harappa and
    Mesopotamian civilizations are the most numerous in the ED III and Akkadian periods&quot;
    from 2500 to 2250 BC (Ratnagar 1981: 204). Elsewhere in an unpublished paper on
    agriculture, Ratnagar (n.d.) notes &quot;dramatic&quot; declines of both the sown area and
    the yields of wheat in the Lagash area of Mesopotamia first between 2400 and 2100 BC and
    then still further declines to 1700 BC. She also notes the time of troubles in Egypt from
    2250 to 2035 BC, when starvation and foreign incursions made all Pharaohs' hold on power
    short lived. Since the invaders included especially Lybians, the implication is that also
    they were in or were entering this world system. </p>
    <p>Moreover, </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The pre-Indus connections were all overland with Afghanistan, Iran and
      Turkmenia...[and] gave rise to intermediary settlements in Afghanistan and Iran - such as
      Tepe Yaha, Shar-i-Sokhta and Mundigak. All these three sites lost their importance and
      came to their last stages of their life when Mohenjo-darians or the Mature Indus people
      began to forge ahead in their civilizational advance by capturing the world trade market
      of that time. They now directly approached the mineral sources areas.... [Then] it was the
      direct contact with the Gulf countries which led to a new phase of expanding trade and
      consequent enricheness by both the Mohenjo-darians as well as by the people of the
      Gulf.... There was shift in the trade routes from north to south in this period, and
      greater reliance was seen on sea route.... The coasts from Mesopotamia down the Gulf all
      along the Arabian sea to Gujarat is littered with sites bearing evidence of the Mature
      Indus period....The Oman sites not only point to connections with the Indus valley, but
      they have a marked relationship with southeastern Iran sites.... But the rise of the Gulf
      sites seem[s] to coincide with the rise of Indus cities in the east.... The important
      thing is that sea connections were evident only in the Mature period, neither before not
      after it.... As a matter of fact it was because of the Indus-Mesopotamia contacts that
      there was a rise of ... intermediate sites along the Persian Gulf making them
      international.... (Shaikh n.d.: 2-23 passim). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>My only doubt would be whether it was the Harappans' direct contact with the Gulf that
    brought expansion and richness as Shaikh says; or the other way around whether it was not
    general economic expansion that brought on the contact with and therefore richness of the
    inhabitants both of the Indus and the Gulf. </p>
    <p>In summary, the datings by Edens and Kohl, Dales, and Ratnagar, as well as others
    scattered through the archaeological literature, all attest to something of a generalized
    or generalizing A phase expansion during the first half and a major B phase crisis
    spreading from west to east through all of the West Asian world system in the late 3rd
    millennium BC. E.N. Chernykh (n.d.:371) notes destabilization also farther north
    throughout the Early Metal Age communities in the second quarter of the 3rd millennium.
    The 27th to 25th centuries were &quot;one of major culture-historical change ... reflected
    in various spheres (political, ethno-cultural, productive and technological), themselves
    clearly interrelated&quot; in Western Asia, Asia Minor, and the more northerly regions of
    the Circumpontic area stretching from the Adriatic to the Urals and Volga in the east and
    the Aegean and Asia Minor in the South (158). &quot;The period of greatest disruption was
    probably the twenty-sixth and twenty-fifth centuries BC (on the basis of a series of
    calibrated radiocarbon dates)&quot; (371). </p>
    <p>Kajsa Ekholm already observed that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>in the period around 2.300-2.200 B.C. there occurred serious economic crises that
      affected much of the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean. Everywhere there is
      indication of decline in quality and quantity of production that was usually state
      monopoly and oriented to export. Correlatively, there was an increase of local violence
      often culminating in obliterating warfare and destruction. These large scale crises are
      often explained by barbarian invasions, but it is just as likely that the violence is
      internal, the only migrants being &quot;capital&quot; and labor forced out of their homes
      by acute survival problems. The collapse of &quot;supralocal&quot; space leads to
      accelerating competition between and within political units, that is to warfare and
      intensified class struggle (Ekholm 1980:165). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Indeed, the &quot;external&quot; and &quot;internal&quot; problems need not have been
    unconnected let alone mutually exclusive. Invaders were more likely to succeed when their
    target was already economically and politically / militarily weakened by its own and
    regional or system wide crisis. Moreover, the invasions themselves were often generated by
    survival problems in their own areas of precedence and/or by falling domino like invasions
    and other pressures from still further beyond, particularly in Central Asia. These
    considerations, of course, raise largely still unanswered questions both about common
    ecological/ demographic changes or cycles and the extent of the extension of the
    &quot;world system&quot; into and the &quot;centrality&quot; of Central Asia (Frank
    1992c). </p>
    <p>In a similar vein, E.N. Chernykh also argues that regarding </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>the conexion between large-scale movements of people and the collapse of the system, I
      would like to point out that displacement by another group is by no means always the root
      cause of the formal alteration in and destruction of a culture. Much more often, perhaps,
      movements of population are brought about by reason of the internal conditions of a
      society, and an increase in deep and hidden processes that require changes in a number of
      social structures. Another cause is related to ecological changes (Chernykh n.d.:366). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Unfortunately, Chandler's (1987) data on the number of cities and their sizes as
    recorded by Bosworth (1992) and Wilkinson (1991) [his 1992 test follows Gills and Frank
    and only begins with the 2nd millennium] do not [yet?] reflect these changes: They only
    begin in 2250 BC with 8 cities in the region, record 9 in 2000 BC and 8 again in 1800 BC,
    plus one in India, for which however none were recorded during its Harappan civilization
    prime in the 3rd millennium. </p>
    <p>It would of course be desirable if others more qualified than I would refine the dates,
    places, and geographical movement of the economic cycle and to explore its relation to
    shifts in &quot;hegemony&quot; within the World System in West Asia and elsewhere during
    the 3rd millennium BC. Perhaps the same could also throw further light on the
    center-periphery structure and regional changes in who was able and not to sit on which of
    its musical chairs at what times -- and why. Indeed, such research and analysis might also
    assuage rather than further deepen Philip Kohl's continuing doubts about these center-
    periphery relations. [Andrew and Susan Sherratt (1991) begin this task for the late 3rd
    millennium but concentrate on the 2nd millennium, as we will note below]. </p>
    <p>In conclusion of this review of the third millennium BC, we may ask with Shereen
    Ratnagar </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>whether the eclipse of the sea trade can explain the collapse of the Harappan urban
      system....It may well have been a significant factor....If the efficient and wide-
      reaching urban system of the Harappans was generated by trade mechanisms and dominated by
      a merchant class become powerful by its successful participation in an extensive trade
      network, and if the 'markets' for this mercantile urban system dwindled, as has been
      argued before, the wealth and power of rulers would have been seriously affected.
      Repercussions of a fall in the quantum of trade could also have been felt by the rural
      population,&quot; [if only through the move back to the countryside of newly unemployed
      urban dwellers. That may be how Harappan civilization] &quot;was phased into
      oblivion&quot; (Ratnagar 1981:237,253). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In that case, perhaps Harappa was phased into oblivion also as a delayed consequence of
    an already earlier more generalized late 3rd millennium long B phase crisis throughout
    most of the world system in West Asia. For &quot;in conclusion, the evolution of the Indus
    Valley civilization must be explained historically: that is, by reference to those larger
    processes which all interacting societies of West Asia were experiencing in the latter
    half of the third millennium B.C. (Kohl 1984:356). </p>
    <h3>SECOND MILLENNIUM BC LATE BRONZE AGE CYCLES</h3>
    <p>The extent and shape of the world system at the beginning of the 2nd millennium and its
    expansion/contraction as well as hegemonial shifts through the late bronze age still
    remain less clear [at least to me] than would be desirable. Kohl (1987:23) contends that
    there was no direct contact from one end to the other, indeed more, that &quot;there was
    not a single Bronze Age world system.&quot; A late 3rd millennium gravitational shift to
    the Gulf region, which continued into the 2nd millennium, was noted above. In Mesopotamia,
    activity shifted northward and became more decentralized with many smaller political units
    until the rise of Babylon. Then, &quot;the central area of the Near East, from the Zagros
    to the Mediterranean, and from the Gulf to the Taurus and sometimes beyond to the Black
    Sea, appears to have formed a natural unit ... and there was a developed network of routes
    and exchanges within the region. Egypt is conspicuously absent&quot; but there may have
    been connections to Cyprus and/or the Aegean (Larsen 1987:53). Kristiansen (1992:34,31)
    goes further: &quot;Regional interaction between empires of productive irrigation
    agriculture in the Near East, commercial city states in the Mediterranean, nomads to the
    north, and ploughland agriculture and mineral exploitation in temperate Europe, created a
    rather unique world system from appr. 2.000 B.C. onwards ... characterized by the
    intensification of connections ... forming a regional hierarchy of indirect C/P
    [center/periphery] relations.&quot; </p>
    <p>On the other side, with the decline of Harappan civilization, the Indus Valley seems to
    drop out for about a millennium, at least in regular contacts with the west. However,
    there is some evidence of an Indian turn southward, as Dales suggests, and eastward
    instead. Jonathan Friedman (n.d.) links the latter in with the emergence of the trading
    and migratory system between the Indian East Coast and Southeast Asia and the Lapita
    expansion into Melanesia and Polynesia. On Harappa's Central Asian frontier, late 3rd
    millennium settlements appear in Bactria, Margiana, and the Kopet Dagh piedmont in perhaps
    previously less settled areas. New evidence shows that, excepting perhaps in the last
    named, urban settlement continues and only shifts location through the late bronze age and
    increases into the iron age. According to Kohl (1984, 1987), this evidence contravenes the
    previous impression of an urban collapse, to which I return in the discussion of the next
    B phase below. He also argues for the probable expulsion of Harappans due to competition
    for minerals from Afghanistan. </p>
    <p>The A and B long cycle phases and their dating suggested by Gills and Frank (1992) seem
    to be largely confirmed by evidence from Chandler's city census and many recent accounts
    by archaeologists. Before the rather firm 1200 BC date for the final crisis of the 2nd
    millennium bronze age however, they neither inspire additional confidence in our dating,
    nor do they offer sufficient guidance to a definite alternative dating. </p>
    <h4>A Phase 2000 - 1800/1700 BC ?</h4>
    <p>The identification of cycle phases in the world system by Gills and Frank (1992) began
    with a &quot;B&quot; crisis phase from 1700 to 1500/1400 BC. This implies a previous
    &quot;A&quot; phase of expansion, especially if the 3rd millennium ended with an earlier
    long B phase. The evidence, however, is not unambiguous. Chandler's city census remains at
    9 in 2000 BC and in 1800 BC. However, there is an addition of a city in India, that
    Wilkinson regards as spurious -- and that comes at the time of the extinction of the
    Harappan civilization -- which may also have continued its decline during these first two
    centuries of the 2nd millennium. The decline of (southern) Mesopotamia is marked by the
    loss 3 of its 6 cities in the Chandler census, but Egypt increased from 3 to 5 cities.
    Related to Egypt and the Levant, economic activity increased in Cilicia and Cyprus and
    then also Crete and the Aegean, which began developing Minoan civilization. More of the
    Mediterranean and its coasts are incorporated into the world system. Larsen (1987)
    describes a trading system centered on the middle-man role of the relatively small
    Mesopotamian city of Assur, which flourished apparently independently during the 19th
    century BC and then was absorbed into a larger political unit until Hammurabi unified the
    whole area around Babylon. </p>
    <p>On the other side, beginning around 2000 BC a region centered around Bactria and
    Margiana in Central Asia flourishes, but for no more than 250 years ending in 1800-1700 BC
    according to Hiebert &amp; Lambert-Karlovsky (1991). I noted above, however, that
    according to Kohl, evidence now disputes the thesis of total collapse of urban settlement
    there in the next period, to which we may now turn as the first B phase identified in
    Gills and Frank (1992). </p>
    <h4>B Phase 1700-1400?</h4>
    <p>Gills and Frank noted simultaneous crises of interlinking hegemonies and the conquests
    of Anatolia and Mesopotamia by Hittites and Kassites, while the Hurrians and Hyksos
    overran the Levant and Egypt. That is, this was another of the recurrent [cyclical?] 200
    year long periods of massive migrations out of Central Asia, which I noted in my study of
    the latter (Frank 1992c). This period of simultaneous disintegration of hegemonies was
    accompanied by inevitable economic disruptions. Silver notes the onset of the 'Dark Age'
    (1600-1347 BC) and says that &quot;during this era urban life and legal documents relating
    to private commercial activities decline steeply&quot; (Silver 1985:161). The Dark Age is
    also marked by the &quot;disappearance .... of all vestiges of social reform - or
    experiments - of the Hammurabi era&quot; after his death about 1750 BC (Oppenheim and
    Reiner 1977:159). </p>
    <p>Similarly, Chernykh (n.d.:165) notes that in the 18th to 17th centuries &quot;there is
    another noticeable increase in destructive phenomena manifested in the majority of
    Eurasian cultures.&quot; He remarks on &quot;the destabilization of the ethno-cultural and
    political systems ... between the eighteenth century BC and the sixteenth century, when
    obvious signs of universal cultural crises and mass migrations can be observed ...
    throughout the Eastern European steppe and forest-steppe ... [as well as] in the eastern
    Mediterranean&quot; (372) to which Gills and Frank already referred. Like we, Chernykh
    also remarks on the simultaneous collapse in distant China, followed later in the 16th
    century by the emergence of the Shang state. He says that a whole chain of cultures
    disintegrated and new ones were formed in their place (230) and that in the 16th century
    &quot;in all of Eastern Europe as in other regions, completely new ethnocultural
    communities established themselves&quot; (165). </p>
    <p>Bosworth and Wilkinson both find that Chandler's city census confirms a B phase during
    this period, especially in Egypt, which drops from 5 major cities in 1800 BC to 3 in 1600
    BC, and in India. Increases are registered, however, for Asia Minor and the Aegean.
    Wilkinson notes 4 political economic &quot;peaks&quot; in the period 1600-1400 BC and six
    peaks in the succeeding period from 1400 to 1200 BC, which we identified as an A phase.
    The Sherrats (1991:369-70), who concentrate more on westerly regions, witness &quot;an
    increase of scale and tempo, with the corresponding friction of growth, between 1700 and
    1400 BC....The political consequences of this enlarged scale of activity were to create
    new, expansive power-centres on the edges of the system, which sought to achieve
    independence and extend their control over the centre.&quot; This increase in scale, which
    is not uncommon in periods of crisis also in the modern world system (Frank 1978a), also
    helped set the stage for the next A phase expansion. </p>
    <h4>A Phase 1600/1500? - 1400 - 1200BC</h4>
    <p>Gills and Frank (1992) dated the next expansion from 1400 to 1200 BC. However, there is
    some evidence that it may have begun earlier. From 1360 BC to 1200 BC, the total number of
    major cities declines by one, and also by one each in each of the Aegean/Mediterranean,
    Asia Minor, Egyptian and Levant regions. Nonetheless, Bosworth interprets Chandler's city
    data to &quot;lend strong support&quot; to this period to its dating as an A phase by
    Gills and Frank, and Wilkinson treats it as a &quot;rally,&quot; despite some misfitting
    data and his observation of an increase in &quot;peaks,&quot; as noted above. </p>
    <p>Chernykh (n.d.:290,313-4) also finds increased interaction between Eurasian and
    European provinces between the 14th and 12th centuries. However, he also regards a longer
    period, beginning with the 16th century BC and including this period until the 13th and
    12th centuries BC, as one of &quot;stability.&quot; Then also &quot;a whole chain of new
    metallurgical provinces, stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic, was formed. The
    technology of casting thin-walled tools and weapons, and the production of tin-bronzes
    spread explosively through this entire area.&quot;(n.d.: 372-3) In the 16th and 15th
    centuries, from the Dnieper eastward there was a sharp increase in the amount of mining in
    new copper and tin ore areas in the Urals, Kazakhstan, the Altai and both sides of Lake
    Baikal. &quot;The huge scale of mining in a number of the mines is astonishing&quot;
    (231). The &quot;volume of mining reached truly fantastic proportions&quot;: For instance
    2 million metric tons of ores were mined and some 100,000 tons of copper were smelted at
    just two Kazakh copper-ore deposits. There were &quot;specialized settlements of
    professional miners, metallurgists and metalworkers&quot; (231-35). There was a 1,000
    kilometer trade route for tin (235), and copper ore was transported 300 km through the
    mountains (243). &quot;Steppe and forest-steppe peoples had a uniform economy and were
    very closely connected to one another. cultures, it appears, were not isolated but
    consisted of open systems: economic, ideological, and kin-based interconexion and exchange
    were not only possible but, very probably, actively encouraged&quot; (236). Strangely
    however, Chernykh also remarks on a &quot;significant territorial rupture between ...
    Eurasian and European systems&quot; at this time (288). </p>
    <p>Kristian Kristiansen (1992) also diagrams an upward phase of Tumulus culture in
    North-Central Europe between 1600 but especially 1500 and 1250 BC. In Europe, Kristiansen
    (19xx:30) notes &quot;an expansion phase suddenly, within a generation at about 1500 B.C.
    the fully fledged chiefdom structure emerged in northern Europe ... [in] a period of
    conspicuous wealth [that] lasted, with some ups and downs, from 1500 to 1100 B.C., but,
    already in the later part ... declined.&quot; Kristiansen (1992:22) also remarks on
    expansion from 1500 onward, along with a shift in trade of northern Europe with the
    Mediterranean area from an eastern axis via the Danube and Black Sea towards the Western
    Mediterranean and Italy instead via the Rhone Valley. </p>
    <p>For the Sherratts (1991:370) also, &quot;these two centuries [1400- 1200 BC] are
    somewhat arbitrarily separated from the preceding phase, and mark the climax of the
    palatial trading system and the political frameworks within which it was carried
    out.&quot; Like Gills and Frank (1992), the Sherratts underline the expansion of the
    Hittites and Assyrians, but also a major phase of urbanization in Cyprus, the importance
    of Rhodes, and a shift from Crete the Greek mainland. They also remark on the related
    &quot;intensive diplomatic activity&quot; among blocs and others. Similarly, Mario
    Liverani (1987: 67) also remarks on the exceptionally high frequency of paritetical
    treaties in the 15th to 13th centuries. </p>
    <p>Gills and Frank (1992) had observed that dominant but inter-linking hegemonies were the
    Hittite empire, based in Anatolia and the dominant in northern Mesopotamia, and the empire
    of New Kingdom Egypt. The period was clearly marked by the prominence of inter- linking
    hegemonies, including Babylon, Assyria, and Mitanni, all of which took a full part in the
    well developed diplomatic discourse of the period. There was for a time something like a
    concert of powers among these inter-linking hegemonies. The Mycenaean trade supplanted the
    Minoan in the East Mediterranean. </p>
    <p>The Sherratts summarize: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This [1400-1200 BC] period represents the climax of bulk maritime trade in the Bronze
      Age. It differs from the 15th century patterns in the disappearance of Cilicia and Crete
      as major centres in their own right , and the emergence of Cyprus as a major international
      trader....The system thus seems to have differentiated into two components: a major
      long-distance international route marked by port towns and emporia such as Tell abu Hawam,
      Ugarit, Enkomi, Ialysos, Kommos, and stations like Mersa Matruh, and operated by ships
      with large cargoes...heavily capitalises and partly state dependent; and a series of
      cycles operated by long-distance ships of smaller capacity in the west, some controlled
      from mainland centres but many under less centralised control.... Not all this activity,
      however, should be imagined as the peaceful growth of commerce. Factors of international
      competition are evident in the insecurity of the Levant revealed by Amarna letters ...
      [and] Egypt and the Hittites clashed at Kadesh in 1284 (Sherratt 1991:372, 373). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The beginnings of the introduction of iron, especially in weapons but also in tools,
    initiated the beginnings of a major transition. </p>
    <h4>B Phase 1200 - 1000 BC</h4>
    <p>This B phase is most remarkable and remarked as a major period of crisis, indeed of
    &quot;dark ages,&quot; which also spelled the end of bronze age civilization and its
    definitive replacement by the new iron age. Gills and Frank (1992) recalled how Gordon
    Childe (1942: 185) already remarked that &quot;the Bronze Age in the Near East ended round
    about 1200 B.C. in a dark age.... Not in a single State alone but over a large part of the
    civilized world history itself seems to be interrupted; the written sources dry up, the
    archaeological documents are poor and hard to date.&quot; Liverani (1987: 69, 71) also
    comments on &quot;the collapse of Near Eastern Civilization...[whose] crisis is rather
    extended and takes place at roughly the same time over a large area.&quot; He also
    observes, this scarcity of surviving documentation &quot;is not fortuitous ... [but] is
    itself an effect of the crisis (eclipse of scribal schools and palace
    administrations).&quot; For instance, 576 years of Kassite domination in Mesopotamia came
    to and end in 1171 BC. The Cretan based Mycean civilization came to an end about the same
    time. It was again a time of [for?] another 200 year long wave of migration, this time of
    Indo-Europeans eastward toward the Tarim Basin and of Arameans, Dorians and others
    southwestward into the Levant and Greece (Frank 1992c). </p>
    <p>Chernykh echoes this same theme when he writes that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>these processes of widespread migration and the related collapse of cultural systems
      reached a peak in the 11th- 10th centuries BC. Archaeologically speaking, this is the
      boundary between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age - and one of the most significant and
      critical periods in the history of the peoples of the Old World (Chernykh n.d.:373). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&quot;There was a sharp decline in the production of bronze artefacts throughout the
    Eurasian steppe at the end of the LBA&quot; [Late Bronze Age] (322). From 1200 to 1000 BC,
    he also notes a &quot;collapse of the system&quot; in the Irano-Afghan province.
    &quot;Settlements disappear... the settled way of life apparently changed to mobile
    pastoralism&quot; (326). There was a similar falloff in metal production throughout the
    northeast Balkans and Carpathans (323) and a sharp increase in mobile subsistence
    strategies (299). </p>
    <p>Kristiansen (1992:23) relates the &quot;collapse&quot; of the Mediterranean and Near
    Eastern regional systems shortly after 1200 also to Europe and refers to evidence of
    mercenaries and later southward migrations from Central Europe and the Balkans. In Europe,
    agriculture became more dominant and political organization less chiefly and more
    &quot;populist and with a more &quot;democratic ideology.&quot; </p>
    <p>These &quot;dark ages,&quot; are however often dated to have lasted up to 350 years. We
    may return to Peter James' et al treatment of this problem, which is his principal concern
    in Centuries of Darkness, in connection with discussion below of the therefore uncertain
    dating of the beginning of the next A phase. In the meantime suffice it to note his
    agreement and moreso that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>the term 'Dark Age' seems like an understatement when the archaeological remains from
      Babylon ... examined.... There can be no doubt that in many parts of the Old World there
      was a dramatic collapse at the end of the Late Bronze Age. The centralized economies
      controlled from the palaces disintegrated, the old trading markets broke up, diplomatic
      contacts were lost and major settlements were abandoned....Ten separate interpretations of
      the events at the end of the Late Bronze Age can be discerned ... [including] cultural
      decadence [a la Toynbee] ...climactic catastrophes...and invasions by outside barbarians -
      notably the Sea Peoples [and others].... Such 'external' causes are rarely convincing
      because they cannot themselves show why the civilised society was unable to cope (James
      1991:279,311). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Kristiansen (1987:84) notes that &quot;with the decline of international exchange
    networks of prestige goods at the transition to the Iron Age, the whole system of center/
    periphery relations collapsed. the various regions developed autonomous cultural and
    economic traditions.&quot; Sherratt (n.d.:13) also remarks how in the final centuries of
    the second millennium ... the long-distance north-south links, however, temporarily
    slackened: The Nordic regions developed on its own, without plentiful supplies of metal
    from further south.&quot; However, </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>the collapse of large-scale inter-regional trading systems began in the most heavily
      capitalised areas, and its effects reached outward to involve all the palace economies
      which were dependent on them.... Ugarit ... was permanently destroyed some time shortly
      after 1200 BC, along with neighboring Atchana and Carchemish. The recession in Syria which
      followed these destructions had further effects on the Hittite hinterland, and as economic
      difficulties exacerbated local unrest, leading to the destruction of Bogazk?&#01;y
      itself at this time. The Assyrians under Tglath Pielser I (c. 1100) took advantage of this
      unstable situation to invade Syria and the Levant, before the shift of power to
      semi-nomadic Aramean tribes caused a fundamental decentralisatiion of local economies
      (and, incidentally, a new set of inland routes made possible by use of the dromedary)
      (Sherratt 1991: 373,374). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Gills and Frank noted that at the same time, the Mycenaeans in Greece and the Levant
    were overrun by new waves of invasions, which included the Dorians, Aramaeans and
    Phoenicians. The Hittite empire disintegrated. The Kassite dynasty in Babylonia collapsed
    to Chaldeans and Aramaeans. Political power almost everywhere was unstable and short
    lived. </p>
    <p>Chandler's data on cities also support the B phase designation according to Bosworth
    and seem to mark &quot;a genuine&quot; B phase for Wilkinson. The growth of cities
    stagnates; the number of major ones declines a bit; and Hittite and Aegean cities
    disappear from the list altogether. Wilkinson notes a marked decline of political economic
    &quot;peaks&quot; from 6 between 1400 and 1200 BC to only one between 1200 and 1000 BC and
    observes &quot;a more noticeable character of disintegration ... than in preceding
    centuries.&quot; </p>
    <h3>FIRST MILLENNIUM BC IRON AGE WORLD SYSTEM EXTENSION AND CYCLES</h3>
    <p>The extent and development, as well as the precise dating of the cycle phases, of the
    world system during the first millennium are also still subject to dispute. This
    uncertainly is increased by two problems in particular: One problem is the length of the
    last bronze age crisis and the transition to the iron age, which may have differed among
    regions. Another problem, paradoxically, is the vast expansion of the world system,
    probably midway through the millennium, thence definitively to include most of Eurasia and
    more of Africa. India also returns into active participation in the world system, after a
    near millennial absence - at least in my review. </p>
    <p>For these and other reasons, also, Chandler's city data as analyzed by Wilkinson and
    Bosworth display some ambiguity and possible misfits with the direction and/or dating and
    regionality of the cycle phases proposed in Gills and Frank (1992). I will note both the
    fits and these misfits as we review these phases below. However, at least in the western
    part of the world system it might be suggested that the structural divergences created
    during the first millennium B.C. between northern Europe, central Europe and the
    Mediterranean, determined the later course of european history by the establishing
    structural foundations upon which it came to rest, e.g. the limits of the Roman empire in
    Europe&quot; (Kristiansen 1992:35). </p>
    <p>Ghirshman summarizes events in West Asia, where </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The first half of the first millennium B.C. was a turning point in human history. The
      centre of 'world politics' or of the age shifted ...[from alluvial valleys in the south]
      more to the north...that the struggle for world power was centered...[among] three
      principal actors on the drama: the Semitic Assyrians with their vast empire; Urartu, a
      powerful kingdom of Asiatic origin, tenacious opponents of the Assyrians...and finally the
      Aryans, the Iranians who, after a long and arduous struggle, triumphed over their two
      adversaries and, with the spoils, founded the first World Empire [under the Achaemenid
      kings from the 5th century onwards]. There was a shift in the centre of gravity of
      exporting countries. Assyria, which was a great consumer, had no iron mines; for a time,
      especially during the earlier half of the eight century B.C., it was denied access to the
      mining centres of the southern coast of the Black Sea and Transcaucasus by the neighboring
      kingdom of Urartu. Inevitably it turned its attention to Iran....[which obtained this
      metal from regions inaccessible to Assyria] (Ghirshman 1954: 75, 88). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To begin with, the bronze age crisis and the previous B phase seems excessively long by
    some accounts. Peter James (1991) and his collaborators devote a recent book to
    demonstrating inconsistencies and hiatuses in regional datings of the crisis, which
    sometimes leave 350 year gaps during which on the evidence as good as nothing seems to
    have happened. In his review Sherratt (1991b) accords them more success in demonstrating
    the dating problems than in resolving them by their readjustment of the relation between
    dating sequences in Egypt and elsewhere. However, to the extent that the shortening of the
    crisis by James et al is well taken, Gills and Frank's (1992) otherwise more uncertain
    dating of an A phase beginning about 1000 BC also becomes more credible. </p>
    <h4>A Phase 1000 - 800 BC</h4>
    <p>The Sherratts (1991:375) remark that &quot;the system was revitalised ... in the 10th
    century,&quot; particularly along the spice route from Arabia and by Levantine centered
    trade with &quot;pan-Mediterranean scope.&quot; Kristiansen (1992) refers to Phoenician
    expansion through the Atlantic to France and Britain in the 9th and 8th centuries BC.
    Gills and Frank had similarly underlined the Phoenician expansion through the
    Mediterranean during this period and noted the rise of and then challenge to Assyrian
    power on the mainland. However after 1000 BC, metal supplies also increased again in
    distant England and Scandinavia (Kristiansen 1992:24). Indeed, the increase was of such
    enormous proportions in the West in its final phase as to suggest
    &quot;overproduction&quot; and the use of Amorican axes as currency to Kristiansen
    (1992:5). However, &quot;it can hardly be doubted that large scale metal consumption and
    inflation in the west was somehow related to the decrease of metal production in the
    East,&quot; where its consumption declined drastically during the next Hallstatt B2-3
    period and never recovered (pp. 6,5). </p>
    <p>Wilkinson finds this phase &quot;in sync&quot; with and &quot;not challenged&quot; by
    the data. Bosworth also agrees and finds corroboration for Assyria, but suggests that
    &quot;perhaps this A phase might be extended as Niniveh, the seat of Assyrian power, peaks
    somewhere between 800 - 650 BC, when it reaches 120,000 people -- the first city on
    Chandler's list to break the 100,000 mark.&quot; The number of major cities from the
    Mediterranean to India remains the same at ten, however, and increases from 3 to 5 in
    China. </p>
    <h4>B Phase 800 - 550 BC ?</h4>
    <p>It was particularly problematic to identify and date this phase by Gills and Frank
    (1992), who adjusted the opening and closing dates several times and sometimes left them
    ambiguous as well. Therefore, I am not surprise to find that Wilkinson and Bosworth single
    this phase out among bronze and iron age ones as the least confirmed or most challenged by
    the Chandler data on cities. Wilkinson says the phase is not reflected in the Chandler
    data. Bosworth does find an apparent &quot;period of 'contraction' and 'fragmentation,'
    but only in the western part of the Old World. Between 800 and 600 BC there is little
    growth for Babylon, Jerusalem or Van, and other cities drop from the list entirely. By
    contrast, Chinese cities roughly double in size, and another Indian city appears.&quot;
    For this phase, Gills and Frank (1992) noted increased competitive pressures in the
    Mediterranean and of rivalries in West Asia, as well as the presumably related collapse of
    the Assyrian empire in the 7th century BC. However, we also noted technological / economic
    development in India and new rivalries in China during this period. The growth in the East
    apparently foreshadows its approaching inclusion in the &quot;Central World System,&quot;
    which is also reflected in city data problems with the subsequent phases and their dating
    by Gills and Frank. </p>
    <h4>The Axial Age</h4>
    <p>This period was called the &quot;Axial Age&quot; by Karl Jaspers (1949/1953), who
    regarded it as the turning point in human history. He also noted, like Frederik Teggart
    (1939) and William McNeill (1963) more recently, that the great religious movements and
    their prophets were born at almost the same time in the 6th century BC: Pythagoras in
    Italy, Thales in Greece, Ezekiel and the second Isaiha in the Levant, Zoroaster/ism in
    Persia, Buddha and Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, in India, and Lao-tse and
    Confuscius/anism in China. The three above named scholars and others suggested or at least
    implied that this simultaneity was probably no accident. McNeill (1963:338) suggested
    &quot;if social and psychological circumstances of the submerged people and urban lower
    classes were in fact approximately similar in all parts of Western Asia, we should expect
    to find close parallels among the religious movements which arose and flourished in such a
    milieux. This is in fact the case.&quot; </p>
    <p>Indeed, Gills and Frank considered whether these similar &quot;social and psychological
    circumstances&quot; may not also have reflected similar economic circumstances and a at
    least just previous common economic crisis. Moreover, we added, the emergence of
    universalist religions may also be an indication of the high level of real economic
    inter-linkage and perhaps the attainment of a new level or stage of economic integration,
    which characterized this period. For it is also in this &quot;axial&quot; period that, it
    may realistically be argued, China first became permanently incorporated into the Central
    World System. <small>(ADD EVIDENCE HERE?)</small> </p>
    <p>Less researched is the apparent incorporation also of Southeast Asia. Coedes (1968:7),
    following van Stein Callenfels, dates the arrival of bronze in Indochina around 600 BC and
    in the islands around 300 BC, but xx dates iron finds already from 750 BC. Archaeological
    finds also establish significant contacts and trade of tin and gold between the islands
    and the Malayan Peninsula and mainland from the middle of the 1st millennium BC (Rhaman
    1991). That is also the recorded beginning of the &quot;Indianization&quot; of Southeast
    Asia (Coedes 1968, Clover 1991). Indian texts attest to &quot;speculative mercantile
    voyages for commercial profit, financed by merchant guilds in many parts of India&quot; in
    the 4th century BC (Clover 1991). At the same time, according to Chinese texts, their
    merchants travelled and carried silk over the &quot;southwestern route&quot; from
    Szechuan, through Yunan, across Burma into India. This route was also prominent again in
    the 1st centuries BC and AD. Moreover there was &quot;considerable trade&quot; between
    Chinese and YG&#01;ehs to the South in China and Indochina before the end of the 3rd
    century BC. Then a Ch'in emperor sent five armies of 500,000 men against the YG&#01;eh
    to secure economic</p>
    <h4>A Phase 600/550 - 450/400 BC ?</h4>
    <p>During this phase, Gills and Frank (1992) noted the economic development in Greece,
    replacing that of the Phoenicians, and especially in Persia. This period witnessed the
    rise of the Achaemenid Persian empire, which stabilized much of West Asia by re-imposing a
    more unified political order in that part of the world economy and system. The Achaemenids
    from Darius to Xerxes achieved at least a regional position of hegemonic accumulation in
    the world system, on the basis of the imperial tribute system. The Persian empire exceeded
    even the Assyrian in the degree to which it succeeded in incorporating the most important
    economic zones of the world system in West Asia. There was at this time a shift in the
    center of gravity of the world economy of very great historical importance. The key area
    of logistical inter-linkage in the world economy/system shifted from Syria and the Levant
    to Central Eurasia. Achaemenid control of Central Asian cities, such as the great city of
    Bactra, and the northwest India trading center of Taxila were very important elements in
    consolidating Persian hegemony and accumulation. The Persian investment in infrastructure
    included the 1677 mile Royal Road, which Darius built from Ephesus to Susa and the road
    from Babylon to Ortospana (near Kabul). Persian cities, like their Assyrian predecessors,
    were cosmopolitan; and its armies were multi- national. &quot;It was in this period that
    the great caravan cities of Syria - Aleppo, Hama, Homs (Emesa), and Damascus, in
    particular - truly came into their own, receiving goods form the Silk Road as well as
    spices and perfumes from Arabia's Incense Road and other luxuries brought by sea from
    India. Arameans ...were such active traders on these caravan cities that their speech
    became the common commercial language&quot; (Franck &amp; Brownstone 1986:65). </p>
    <p>Since this phase falls within a longer period between two of Chandler's city censuses
    in 650 and 450 BC, Wilkinson observes that the data are ambiguous but &quot;at least not
    out of sync.&quot; Bosworth sees the data as broadly confirmatory, but suggests that
    &quot;Frank and Gills' focus on Central Asia as the locus of this A phase seems to be
    misplaced, as events there are eclipsed once again by those farther east&quot; in China
    and Korea. The Bactra and Taxila, signalled as trading cities by Gills and Frank, do not
    appear on Chandler's list for this period; though I might retort that commercial
    importance is not necessarily always reflected in population size, eg. Hong Kong today.
    However, Bosworth notes that &quot;China begins as practically a footnote in Chandler's
    list and by 430 BC it has seven of the world's largest 25 cities and the second
    largest.... This dramatic rise cannot be over-emphasized.&quot; Whether Gills and Frank
    were guilty of a &quot;western,&quot; that is Central Asian, bias at the expense of China
    is worthy of consideration. However that may be, the &quot;dramatic rise&quot; of China in
    the city leagues also speaks for its growing commercialization and probably relations with
    and incorporation into the Central World System at this time, whose world historical
    significance &quot;cannot be overemphasized.&quot; p In the West, Kristiansen (1992)
    focuses on important events between about 600 and 450 BC in Europe. It was re- or more
    fully integrated into the Mediterranean and it in turn into the West Asian world
    [system?]. &quot;A new axis of exchange emerged (during Ha[llstatt] B2-3), stretching from
    northern Italy over Switzerland to the Lower Elbe and further on to Scandinavia, Northern
    Germany and Pommerania&quot; (pp.6-7). Dietler (1989) argues for the important
    intermediary role of Rhone valley inhabitants in articulating and perhaps even initiating
    such long-distance north-south trade and to &quot;foster dependent relations of a
    center-periphery nature.&quot; The Rhone corridor trade to Hallstatt Europe broke down
    again in the early 5th century. As a result also in Central Europe, the Hallstatt cultures
    that had first &quot;climaxed,&quot; then &quot;declined&quot; as trade routes again
    shifted and/or they overexploited their peripheries, according to Kristiansen. </p>
    <h4>B Phase 450 - 350 BC ?</h4>
    <p>Although Gills and Frank inveighed against excessively Greco- centered readings of this
    period, we did identify this relatively short B phase largely on the basis of symptoms of
    economic crisis in Greece and its relations with Persia. Intensified class struggle and
    wars symptomatic of an underlying economic contraction or slow down in expansion.
    Rostovtzeff had characterized the fourth century as one marked by increased
    proletarianization, landlessness, unemployment, and food shortage. It was marked by a
    contraction in the market for manufacturers and the ruin of &quot;free&quot; petty
    producers. Wealth was over-concentrated in the hands of the commercial and landed ruling
    classes. Livy notes a series of famines in Italy in 490,477, 456, 453,440, and 392 BC. The
    Celts invaded Italy and sacked Rome, while setting up the kingdom of Galatia in Asia
    Minor. The hegemonic disintegration of this period is in evidence from the Peloponnesian
    wars and the successful revolt of Egypt against Persia c. 400 BC and the breakaway of the
    Indus from the Persian empire c. 380 BC. </p>
    <p>The phase is too short to be well reflected by Chandler with a longer time span between
    city censuses. Nonetheless, Bosworth notes that the size of Athens decline; but that of
    Rome increase several fold. Kristiansen (1992:11,9) remarks that &quot;the apparent
    correlation betweencompetitive changes in Greek, Phoenician and Etruscan trade routes with
    the geographical movement and collapse of princely centers [in North-Central Europe] has
    been seen as a confirmation of the dependence on long distance trade and the supply of
    prestige goods.... This question is ultimately linked to the problem of explaining the
    collapse of the Hallstatt centers ...[and their being] able to monopolize trade with the
    Mediterranean to such a degree&quot; at this time, when they gave way to the Celtic La
    Tene culture after 450 BC. Chernykh (nd.:373) also terms this &quot;the next 'destructive'
    period, &quot; when Celts moved from Western Europe towards the Balkans and Asia Minor in
    the 5th century and Sarmatians in the opposite direction in the 4th century. Chernykh also
    notes the political destabilization of the Warring States period in China and new
    confrontations with Central Asian pastoralists. &quot;the high-water mark of these
    destructive processes and the disintegration and reformation of cultures in Eurasia was
    the fourth to third centuries BC&quot; (Chernykh n.d.:374). </p>
    <h4>A Phase 350 - 250/200 BC ?</h4>
    <p>Gills and Frank's identification and dating of this A phase rested primarily first on
    the Alexandrian expansion through West Asia into Central Asia and India. It was followed
    by the economic expansion in India under the Mauryas in the 3rd century after Alexander's
    death and failure; and the simultaneous consolidation of China under the Qin dynasty, as
    well as the increase in trade between the last two of these regions. Here again,
    Chandler's census dates are not very helpful. Nonetheless, Bosworth notes the prominence
    of Alexandrian cities, including Alexandria itself as the third largest in the world,
    during this phase. However, he also suggests that, again, the East may deserve
    &quot;top-billing&quot;: In 200 BC, for the first time the world's largest city is in
    China (Changan with 400,000 inhabitants) and the second largest is in India (Patna with
    350,000). China and India now also have similar large shares of urban population the
    world's top 25 cities. </p>
    <h4>B Phase 250/200 - 100/50 BC</h4>
    <p>Gills and Frank noted another brief B phase in the Mediterranean region, including
    Egypt and Greece during the 2nd century BC. It was again marked by signs of crisis and
    contraction and slower expansion of the market. In Egypt, the second century was
    characterized by all the signs of economic decline, such as over-taxation, official
    corruption, increased debt, and unrest and brigandage. The Rosetta stone characterizes the
    period by: &quot;pressure of taxes, rapid accumulation of arrears and concomitant
    confiscations, prisons full of criminals and debtors, public and private, many fugitives
    scattered all over the country and living by robbery, compulsion applied in every sphere
    of life.&quot; There were signs of crisis and slave revolts in Rome, but also imperialist
    expansion westward, which presaged Imperial Rome during the next long period of expansion
    after 100 BC. While this phase is again too short to be reflected in Chandler's census
    dates, which jump from 100 BC to 200 AD, Bosworth writes that &quot;there is consensus
    that this was a period of 'contraction' and 'decline'.&quot; However, China already began
    its period of expansion under the Western Han Dynasty after 200 BC. Since Imperial Rome
    did as well, should the beginning of the next major A phase be moved forward a century or
    so? That would convert this B phase into a still shorter and more localized phenomenon,
    hardly worthy of the name. </p>
    <h4>A Phase 100 BC - 200 AD</h4>
    <p>I do not wish to prolong this examination of the bronze and iron ages to treat this
    phase -- and the perhaps beginning again of a new period in world system history -- here
    in further detail. Suffice it to recall that this period was the high-water-mark of
    expansion phases in Gills and Frank (1992), with the simultaneous and well known rise to
    imperial grandeur of Han China, Kushan India, Parthian Iran, Axium East Africa, and
    Imperial Rome. [Their rise was followed by their again simultaneous decline in the major B
    phase from 200 to 500 AD, which was also again accompanied by another major wave of
    invasions, including that of the legendary Attila the Hun]. Moreover, we cited both Roman
    writers like Pliny and more recent ones like Teggart to the effect that what happened at
    one end of this chain also substantially affected what happened at the other end. The
    writings of Ptolemy and the famous Periplus of the Erythrean Sea attest to regular
    maritime trade to the west coast of India, but the same was equally or more intensive also
    onward from the Coromandel east coast and Ceylon to Southeast Asia and China. Chinese
    Eastern Han Dynasty documentation attests to significant trade with Southeast Asia in the
    2nd century AD, and there is also evidence of the same from the 2nd century BC. </p>
    <p>Jacques Gernet notes </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Just as the power of the great nomad empire of the Hsiung-nu in the steppe zone was
      probably created and strengthend by import of iron and silks from China, Han expansion in
      Asia was certainly due fundamentally to the economic upsurge of the Chinese world. Not
      only were Han China's strength and prestiege abroad based on this economic prosperity, but
      it was also the trade with Mongolia, Korea, central Asia, South China, and northern
      India... (Gernet 1982:129). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Agreed, except for the [also Western] Sino-centric perspective that sees the
    &quot;economic upsurge&quot; in all these regions and even the power of the Hsiung-nu in
    Central Asia as propulsed fundamentally by &quot;the Chinese world.&quot; Apparently the A
    phase economic upsurge was not confined or due fundamentally only to China, or else it
    would not have so easily included all the other areas Grenet mentions, not to mention many
    more across Eurasia. </p>
    <p>Moreover, </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>the great expansion of Southeast Asian, and particularly Island-Mainland exchange which
      is evident in later prehistory is, I believe, closely connected with this Indo-Roman
      commerce and can be explained in part, at least, by a rising demand....[Recent] finds have
      been made or recognised and these are enough, I believe, to permit us to argue that
      regular exchange links between India and Southeast Asia commenced earlier than Wheeler or
      Rashke allowed.... By the early Christian era these trade routes reached out to bring
      together the previously rather separate Southeast Asian exchange systems, linking them
      into a vast network stretching from Western Europe, via the Mediterranean basin, the
      Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, to India, Southeast Asia and China...[in] what has been
      called the World System (Clover 1991:n.p.) </blockquote.> However, writing of course quite
      independently, Chernykh (n.d.:374) also remarks that &quot;the period of renewed
      stability, which lasted from the second century BC to the second/third century AD, was
      related to the existence of three major empires: the Han Empire on the eastern flank of
      the Eurasian landmass; Rome on the western flank; and the Parthian and Kushan kingdoms in
      the centre&quot; before the all gain succumbed to the &quot;truly colossal&quot;
      &quot;destructive processes and migrations,&quot; which were &quot;linked to the
      destruction of this system.&quot; </p>
      <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
      <p>&quot;Clearly there is substance to the Gills and Frank proposal. One would not want to
      ... reverse the labels of the phases: the fit is too good. Still, it needs more measuring,
      hewing, trimming .... Considerable refinement of phase time- boundaries, and data
      collection for crucial but unmeasured years, is called for&quot; (Wilkinson 1992: 11,30).
      So writes the author of one of two empirical &quot;tests&quot; of the identification and
      dating of long cycles in the world system by Gills and Frank (1992). </p>
      <p>This new essay has sought, if not yet to collect more data, at least to begin
      systematizing some of the other relevant data, other information, and their analysis,
      which is now available to me as a non professional on short order. Practically, in two
      senses of the word however, my selection of the pieces to place in this jig saw puzzle are
      largely derived from the documentation by professionals, which my friends among them have
      kindly supplied to me of their own and other writings. [Eg. Philip Kohl supplied me his
      own and others' still unpublished writings by Hiebert and Lamberg-Karlovsky, and the
      translation of Chernykh's book from the Russian]. It would of course be desirable that
      professionals more qualified than I assemble this puzzle much more competently and fully.
      They would also have to give much more due weight to the recurring and related migrations,
      invasions and wars in this picture, which have received excessively short schrift in mine
      above. In the meantime and on the basis of the evidence summarily presented above, I may
      conclude as follows. </p>
      <p>Substantial archaeological evidence and important analyses thereof seem to confirm the
      existence of long cycles in what may also for this reason be called an at least 5,000 year
      old world system. Alternating expansive A and contractive B phases reach back through the
      3rd millennium BC and probably into still earlier times. They are so synchronic over so
      large and ever growing part of the world that it truly appears as a true world system --
      if the socio political economic mechanisms that generates this &quot;cycle&quot; is at
      least also partly endogenous to this system and the part of the world that it includes. </p>
      <p>Interestingly, increases and declines in city sizes, as recorded by Chandler and
      reproduced by Wilkinson, also characterize the &quot;Western&quot; hemispheric regions of
      the &quot;New&quot; World in the &quot;Americas&quot; before Columbus
      &quot;discovered&quot; them 500 years ago. However, their phases and cycles are totally
      unsynchronized with the fluctuations in city size and/or the phases of expansion and
      contraction suggested and dated in the &quot;Old&quot; World &quot;Eastern&quot;
      Hemisphere by Gills and Frank (1992) and refined above. </p>
      <p>This implies that the substantial confirmation and occasional adjustment of cycle
      phases by city sizes in Eurasia is not fortuitous and does reflect some underlying
      reality. But what is that? If that underlying reality is climactic change, which is only
      common to all parts of the &quot;system&quot; and to which they independently react in
      tandem without significant interaction with each other, should we then still call them
      part of a single system? Perhaps an ecological system, but not a social one? </p>
      <p>Yet, I hope that I have marshalled sufficient evidence above to find that
      &quot;different&quot; regions and people/s have also been so socially interlinked through
      economic, political, migratory, cultural and other both cooperative and conflictive
      relations as to meet the criterion of systemic participation in a single world system. The
      participation of the parts is so inter-active, even if sometimes only indirectly
      chain-linked, that no part of this system would be as it is or was if other parts were not
      as they are or were -- albeit they may all have also reacted to, and on, the global
      ecological constraints. [That was the system criterion proposed in Frank 1990 and Gills
      and Frank 1990/91). </p>
      <p>Notably, major periods of near world system-wide major migration accompanied several of
      the phases I have identified as &quot;B&quot; contractions. This was especially so for the
      major B phase &quot;dark ages&quot; in 1700-1400 BC, 1200-1100 BC, and 200-500 AD which
      initiated a &quot;Dark Age&quot; in Europe, as well as the mid first millennium
      &quot;Axial Age,&quot; discussed in Frank (1992c). The significance of this
      &quot;coincidence&quot; itself remains a dark mystery. However, Chernykh (n.d.:367) also
      notes that &quot;these are critical periods in human history. The migration at the end of
      the second and start of the first millennium BC defined the boundary between the Bronze
      Age and the Iron Age; the later migration [in the 200-500 AD B phase] defined the boundary
      between Antiquity and the Medieval period or, in Western historiographic terminology,
      feudalism.&quot; </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>So the question must finally be raised - were all these regional trends and dramatic
        historical events somehow interlinked? Were Europe, Asia and the Mediterranean so
        interdependent that major changes in one region would lead to predictable changes in the
        other regions, forming a kind of interrelated world system?... But how did these changes
        [in Northern Europe] relate to changes in Central Europe and the Mediterranean. Were they
        somehow connected? This is, in the last instance, dependent on our chronologies, where I
        do not feel able to decide (at least not at the present moment) if there is a significant
        time gap or not between these regional changes.&quot; So ask and answers Kristian
        Kristiansen (1992: 20, 28). </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&quot;We suspect that such explosions follow some regular rhythm; that, in accordance
      with this rhythm, various provinces at the same time either collapse or emerge; however
      the nature of this rhythm is equally unclear.... We are going into the unknown when we try
      to understand the reasons for such explosions and successions, and to try to identify the
      hidden driving force behind such phenomena&quot; (Chernykh n.d.:354). </p>
      <p>Both of these archaeologists and others of course also refer to possible climactic
      constraints and dynamics. &quot;There have been several attempts to link oscillations in
      historical development in particular regions with various natural phenomena, which in the
      final analysis, are related to periodic changes in global climate. Hypotheses of this
      kind, are to a certain extent contradicted...&quot; Chernykh (n.d.:376) writes, because
      the same kind of changes are not observable in Stone Age cultures, which experienced the
      same climactic changes at the same time. On the other hand, Neolithic Stone Age peoples
      were more affected by environmental change. Although elsewhere (Frank 1992c) I have also
      emphasized the possible role of climactic cycles particularly in Central Asia, I might
      here add that the problem Chernykh mentions also works the other way around: The same
      climactic change can affect different regions differently. For instance the same period of
      warming can affect agricultural possibilities in arid and humid, and/or high and low
      lying, areas in exactly opposite ways. Yet we have found substantial evidence for very
      generalized simultaneous economic up and down swings over geographically very different
      areas. Moreover, these economic cycles seem to have become progressively shorter over the
      millennia [or has our identification of them just become finer?]. All the more so
      therefore, &quot;the reasons for the changes in rhythm during the 'metal era' should
      probably be sought primarily among the socio-economic conditions of the period,&quot;
      including in particular their interactive participation in a single but cyclically
      developing &quot;world system&quot; (Chernykh n.d.:376). </p>
      <p>An intermediate position, or &quot;model&quot; as he calls it, is proposed by Jack
      Goldstone (1991), writing, however, about early modern history. He notes recurrent waves
      of state breakdown and prior population increases across all of Eurasia, for which it is
      not possible to account in terms only of local conditions or particular cultural patterns.
      So he offers a &quot;structural/demographic model&quot; to explain complicated recurrent
      [cyclical?] interactions: Demographic pressures derived from temporarily falling death
      rates impinge on overstretched resources and lead to bureaucratic paralysis. That in turn
      is derived from elite in-fighting and large sale social rebellion, which lead to state
      breakdown. In Goldstone's &quot;model,&quot; all of these events are thus ultimately - -
      but also socially and not simply physically -- also generated by climactic change.
      Goldstone only analyzed early modern large bureaucratic states. Perhaps however, mutadis
      mutandis his approach may also prove fruitful in the analysis of crises involving other
      political economic institutions in earlier periods as well. </p>
      <p>In [literally] any case, </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>No single factor may account for the observed structural changes, although some
        factors, such as climactic change, may reveal striking patterns of parallelism with
        changes in settlement structure.... Climate thus represented both potential and
        constraints to subsistence, but social and economic forces remain the prime movers when
        the environment is exploited not only close to, but often beyond its carrying capacity....
        In such situations climactic fluctuations may trigger the collapse of an unstable economy.
        [That is] one of the lessons we may learn from Bronze Age sequences...&quot; (Kristiansen
        1992:26). </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is a lesson that sounds particularly pertinent also to our own times as I write
      during the &quot;Earth Summit&quot; in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. </p>

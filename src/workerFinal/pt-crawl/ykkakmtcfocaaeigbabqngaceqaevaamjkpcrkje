<h3 class="blue">Report on a Panel on Information Management Technology Requirements</h3>

<p class="italics">

</p>

<p>To better understand the information management technology requirements for
applications of particular government interest, a panel study was 
conducted in 2001-
2002. Initiated by RIACS (Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science)
  and led by three
co-chairs expert in different application areas, a panel was recruited
with broad and diverse experience and knowledge of the field. To
assure that the directions of the study were responsive to the long-term 
needs of the
government, a steering committee of representatives from the three
sponsoring agencies (DARPA, NASA, NSF) had continual interaction with the 
co-chairs
and RIACS lead.</p>

<p>The study was conducted primarily “online”, with a kickoff meeting held at 
NASA Ames
Research Center on 29-30 November 2001 and a wrap-up meeting held also at 
NASA
Ames on 20-21 June 2002. A report on the results of the study was released 
in November 2002
and is available online at 
&lt;<a href="http://eprints.riacs.edu/documents/data/00/00/00/90/index.html">http://eprints.riacs.edu/documents/data/00/00/00/90/index.html</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>The methodology used in the study was to look at three application areas 
that were felt to
be of particular interest to the government:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Mission Operations</li>
<li>Scientific Data Management</li>
<li>Digital Libraries</li></ul>

<p>While there are certainly other application areas of interest to the 
government (e.g.
logistics, government business operations), the panel felt that these 
three areas spanned the
domain and hence could be used to characterize the nature of the 
requirements.</p>

<p>As the study proceeded through the panel discussions, it became clear that 
the
differences in requirements between the application domains of government 
interest were
more ones of priorities and importance, rather than the areas having 
significantly
different requirements per se. A common thread is the need to interoperate 
with many
diverse information resources, and hence to assure that future systems 
will be
interoperable not only with past and current standards, but adaptable to 
resources that are
not yet recognized. This was probably the major result of the study, and 
the driver for the
recommendations.</p>

<p>It therefore became apparent that investments to improve the technology 
aimed at one of
the application areas would most likely be valuable to the other areas as 
well. The panel
concluded that it was desirable to have a coordinated program of R&D that
pursues a science of information management focused on an environment 
typified by
applications of government interest - highly distributed with very large 
amounts of data
and a high degree of heterogeneity of sources, data, and users.</p>

coordinated the study. The following individuals served on the panel that 
conducted the study and generated the report.</p>

<h3 class="blue">DARE: A New Age in the Provision of Academic Information</h3>

<p>
With the award of 2 million euros for the period 2003-2006, the Dutch government is giving a strong boost to innovation in the provision of academic information in the Netherlands. DARE (Digital Academic Repositories) is a collective initiative by the Dutch universities to make all their research results digitally accessible. The Koninklijke Bibliotheek [Royal Library], the Koninklijke Nederlandse Academie van Wetenschappen [Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences] and the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) [Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research] are also collaborating on this unique project. Coordination is being taken care of by the SURF Foundation, the ICT partnership organisation for higher education and research in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>DARE modernises the management of Dutch academic information by putting an infrastructure system in place and providing advanced services for the digital recording, accessing, storage and distribution of the Dutch academic output. This will greatly improve the visibility of and access to the academic output. DARE will follow open, international standards to ensure interoperability, nationally and internationally. All participating institutions will adopt the standards, while retaining their own responsibility in setting up and maintaining their own repositories.</p>

<p>Digital availability, based on open, international standards, simplifies the further use of the information for various purposes. Examples are publication in traditional or new journals (including electronic ones), long-term storage at the Koninklijke Bibliotheek [Royal Library], inclusion in the NWO's Open Sources system and incorporation in digital learning environments for the future.</p>

<p>In the present situation, the visibility of and access to Dutch academic research leave much to be desired. In the fast-changing world of academic research and communications, changes are needed if the Netherlands wants to maintain its position in the academic world. Linking up with international developments in this area, such as the
Open Archives Initiative, is crucial. In DARE, all the parties concerned are combining forces in a national effort and existing smaller-scale projects are being brought together. In a preparatory workshop late November, 50 representatives from the participating institutions came together to discuss available systems, standards and solutions, as well as work still to be done to complete the set of specifications needed by the institutions to set up their repositories. Work was also started on a programme for involvement of and support by faculty; enhanced accessibility to their research will greatly benefit the public profile of Dutch scholars and their universities. 
For both topics, project teams were formed; they will begin their actual work in January 2003, the official starting-date of DARE.</p>

</p>

<p>Everywhere we turn, people are now talking about portals to information of relevance to our students and staff. Institutional portals, Subject portals, a Scholar's portal, an Image portal, a Geospatial portal, and a host of corporate portals vie for attention, and institutions scrabble to develop a position in this newly ‘hot' area of endeavour.</p>

<p>In the UK, the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Joint Information Systems Committee</a> (JISC) is active in addressing this problem space, and several projects are also exploring portal-related issues, whether at the national (the <a href="http://www.rdn.ac.uk/">Resource Discovery Network's</a> <a href="http://www.portal.ac.uk/spp/">Subject Portals Project</a>) or institutional (<a href="http://www.fair-portal.hull.ac.uk/">PORTAL</a>) level.</p>

<p>For those interested in keeping abreast of current work on portals relevant to Further and Higher Education (mainly in the UK), it would be worth joining the PORTALS list on JISCmail - &lt;<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/portals.html">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/portals.html</a>&gt;.</p> 

<p>A second list, JASIG-UK, has just been set up, and much of the discussion on it will relate to an increasingly popular Open Source portal, uPortal, as used by the PORTAL project and others.</p>

<p>A number of UK universities are now actively deploying uPortal, and many more are considering it as their institutional strategies take shape.  An oversubscribed <a href="http://www.fair-portal.hull.ac.uk/19nov02.html">meeting</a> held in Hull in November clearly demonstrated the degree of interest within the community, and those present called for effort in the UK to focus current activity, and assist the broader community in moving forwards.</p>

<p>uPortal is a product of the international Java in Administration Special Interest Group (<a href="http://www.ja-sig.org/">JA-SIG</a>), whose North American meetings are currently the main source of information. The last meeting, held in Vancouver, is <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue33/portals/">reported</a> in issue 33 of <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/">Ariadne</a>.</p>

<p>It was agreed at the meeting in Hull to form a UK version of this international group, and a mailing list for the UK JASIG has now been set up, with a web site under development.</p>

<p>If you are interested in UK issues around the deployment and use of uPortal, or a UK slant on any other JA-SIG activities, please join us on the new JASIG-UK list.</p>

<h3 class="blue">JISC Consultancy on Archiving of Licensed E-journals</h3>

<p class="italics">

</p>

<p>The transition from purchasing print journals, which the library then owned forever, to licensing access to e-journals for a defined period of time has major implications for libraries and publishers.  In terms of archiving responsibilities, there are no longer any clear-cut distinctions between who should be doing what.  There is a  lack of clarity regarding responsibilities and uncertainty about precisely what libraries are paying for when they license journals.  This has meant that the transition from print to electronic has been more problematic than it might otherwise have been.  The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) is now in its third phase of content activities relating to journals [<a href="#1">1</a>] and it has developed a model licence to help clarify roles and responsibilities.    Since 1999, this licence has included clauses related to archiving, in which primary responsibility is given to the publisher for ensuring that satisfactory arrangements are made for continuing access to material already paid for, in the event of termination of the licence.  Options are continued online access from the publishers' server, or a mutually acceptable archival copy delivered either to the Licensee or a central facility operated on behalf of Higher Education (HE).  The central facility referred to in the licence does not yet exist.</p>  

<p>JISC now feels it is time to explore that possibility further by funding a consultancy from May 2002 for one year.  Maggie Jones took up the consultancy and has been undertaking preparatory work that will provide the basis for an implementation plan and timetable aimed at significantly improving the status quo.  Related developments will also be taken account of, such as anticipated legal deposit legislation for the U.K and the development of e-print archives, both of which may have an impact in the longer term.  In the meantime, it is necessary to deal with the current situation and find ways for libraries to maintain ongoing and affordable access to licensed e-journals.  This will certainly require close collaboration between libraries and publishers in finding mutually acceptable solutions.</p>  

<p>These challenges are not, of course, confined to the U.K., and work in the U.S has been of particular interest.  The Mellon Funded projects [<a href="#"2">2</a>] have already provided insights into the prospects for fruitful collaboration between libraries and publishers and Mellon's continuing work with LOCKSS and JSTOR will be watched with interest.  The work of OCLC in developing its digital archive [<a href="#3">3</a>] is also significant.  While collaboration within and across sectors, and within and across geographic boundaries is going to be increasingly prevalent in the digital environment, it is not yet clear what business arrangements will need to be forged in order to move the agenda forward.  An implementation plan and timetable will be prepared following a workshop in February 2003.  Reports relating to the consultancy will be available <A name="1">from</a> the JISC website in the near future.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.culturalcontentforum.org/">digital Cultural Content Forum</a> (CCF), an international gathering of key stakeholders in the digitisation and delivery of our global cultural assets, invites you to express interest in attending our next meeting, an executive retreat in northern Italy over the weekend of 28-30 March 2003. It will follow the well-known <a href="http://www.vasari.co.uk/eva/florence/">EVA Florence Conference</a>, which may include a wider discussion session on some of the issues being addressed by the CCF for those who are not able to attend the weekend event.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.culturalcontentforum.org/meetings/">Previous meetings</a> have been held in London and in Washington, D.C., and have attracted representatives from North America, Europe, Asia, New Zealand and Australia.</p>

<p>This third meeting will again be by invitation only, and will be limited to no more than 30 participants. The primary scope of discussions will be around explorations of audience for digitised cultural content, and this discussion will be informed by a piece of background research recently commissioned by the CCF, and by presentations and other material contributed by participants.</p>

<p>It is intended that the meeting will result in a far better understanding of existing research into what audiences need from and expect of our cultural institutions in the online environment, and also that the group can agree on a plan of action for progressing activity in this increasingly topical area.</p>

<p>Those interested in attending are requested to submit their expression of interest to <a href="mailto:ccf-info@culturalcontentforum.org">ccf-info@culturalcontentforum.org</a> no later than <em>Friday 17 January 2003</em>.</p>

<p>Expressions of interest should detail any work your organisation has already undertaken in assessing the needs of online audiences, as well as specific issues that you hope might be addressed over the weekend.</p>

<p>Those who are able to contribute content to the commissioned background research, and to provide relevant input for fellow participants in advance of the meeting are especially welcomed.</p>

<p>Successful applicants will be notified by the end of January 2003, and we currently hope to be in a position to meet the costs of <A name="RENARD">accommodation</a> over the weekend.

<p>The ZING Initiative (Z39.50 International Next
 Generation), under the auspices of the Z39.50
 Maintenance Agency at the Library of Congress, is
 pleased to announce Version 1.0 of SRW and CQL.</p>

 <p>SRW ("Search/Retrieve for the Web")  is a
 web-service-based protocol which aims to integrate
 access across networked resources, and to promote
 interoperability between distributed databases by
 providing a common platform. The underpinnings of
 the protocol are formed by bringing together more
 than 20 years experience from the collective
 implementers of the Z39.50 protocol with recent
 developments in  the web-technologies arena. SRW
 features both SOAP and URL-based access mechanisms
 (SRW and SRU respectively) to provide for a wide
 range of possible clients.  It uses CQL, the
 Common Query Language, which provides a powerful
 yet intuitive means of formulating searches. The
 protocol mandates the use of open and
 industry-supported standards XML and XML Schema,
 and where appropriate, Xpath and SOAP.</p>

  <p>The SRW Initiative recognizes the importance of
 Z39.50 (as currently defined and deployed) for
 business communication, and focuses on getting
 information to the user. SRW provides semantics
 for searching databases containing metadata and
 objects, both text and non-text.  Building on
 Z39.50 semantics enables the creation of gateways
 to existing Z39.50 systems while reducing the
 barriers to new information providers, allowing
 them to make their  resources available via a
 standard search and retrieve service.</p>

  <p>SRW, SRU, and CQL have been developed by an
 international team, minimizing cross-language
 pitfalls and other potential internationalization
 problems.  Participants include:</p>

</p>

<p> The Workshop on Web Content Mapping in conjunction with the EURASIA ICT was
held on 31 October 2002 at Shiraz, Iran. The workshop had twelve papers on
different areas of web content analysis. Four sessions were conducted on
various sub-themes that included web content evaluation, web page and content
classification, web content relevance mapping and web databases.</p>

 <p>Web Content Evaluation should be the routine parsing for which models need
to be designed and debated. Farajpahlou and Farideh Osareh detailed this
theme in their papers. Krottmaier has investigated the approach for the
automatic review system. In a paper on Feature Selection of Web Page
Classification, D. Riboni has introduced a method for representing linked
pages using local information that makes hypertext categorization feasible
for real time applications. A semantic web classification system was
recommended by Mortaza Kokabi in his paper. Y. Patel, J. K. Vijayakumar and
B. Ramesh have proposed a model for accessing distributed web content using
ontological metadata.  Nitesh Shrestha, Ralph Busse and Gerald Huck have
designed wrapper generation using an intelligent tagger to perform Graphical
Schema Editor, an example Markup Tool and Grammar Generator for generating a
grammar for automatically extracting data from similarly structured
documents. </p>
 
<p>   Jean-Charles Lamirel, Yannick Toussaint and Xavier Polanco have developed
a hybrid methodology model, MultiSOM for the global and partitioned
classification methods for mapping science and technology. Nachouki and
Quafafou have used the Xquery based approach for extracting semi-structured
data from the web. D. Jacobs, Chandrappa and Pichappan have advocated
citation parsing to supplement web hyperlink mapping in the concept space for
which they have recommended an architecture and presented the tested results.</p>

<p>Bita Shadgar and Ian Holyer have used the WebDEV advantages such as metadata
and access control to present database metadata in a standardized way via
WEDDAD properties for their work and presented the results. Sarasvady,
Pichappan and Vijayakumar have measured the contextual correlation between
the concepts that occur in the web testbed using stop words and controlled

<h4>Resource Publishes Annual Review</h4>

<p>&quot;London, 12 December 2002 - Resource: The Council for Museums, Archives and
Libraries has published its Annual Review 2001/02.  The Review covers various
aspects of Resource's activities during 2001/02, including key achievements and
events, a section on Resource's main operations, the Annual Workplan 2002/03 and a
summary of the Financial Statement.  The Review also looks back at Resource's work
in its first year.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anna Southall, Resource's Chief Executive, said:  'I recently joined
Resource and am very impressed at the enormous amount that has been achieved since
its formation in April 2000.  Resource's core roles are to provide strategic
leadership, act as a powerful advocate, develop capacity and promote innovation
and change and the progress that has been made in these areas is illustrated
throughout the Annual Review.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'The Annual Review is an opportunity to look back at the success of a number of
programmes to date.  These include delivering the massive People's Network project
on time and in budget, securing the first ever sustained funding for regional
museums from Central Government through Renaissance in the Regions and developing
a new regional infrastructure for the sector through the establishment of the
Regional Agencies.  It has been an exciting start for Resource and I look forward
to building on these foundations to ensure increasing public benefit from the work
of museums, archives and libraries.'&quot;</p>

<h4>Science.gov Web Site Connects Public to Government Science</h4>

<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 5, 2002The American public is now connected as never
before to U.S. Government science and technology.  Fourteen scientific
and technical information organizations from 10 major science agencies
have collaborated to create science.gov &lt;<a href="http://www.science.gov">
http://www.science.gov/</a>&gt;, the "FirstGov for Science" web site.
Science.gov is the gateway to reliable information about science and
technology from across Federal government organizations.</p>

<p>From science.gov, users can find over one thousand government
information resources about science.  These resources include: technical
reports, journal citations, databases, Federal web sites, and fact
sheets.  The information is all free, and no registration is required.</p>

<p>"Science.gov aims to bring the substantial resources of the federal
science and technology enterprise together, in one place.  Working
together, federal agencies have assembled countless pages of government
research, data, and reports. The site is a great example of e-government in action," said Dr. John H. Marburger, Director, Office of
Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President.</p>

<p>Science.gov is for the educational and library communities, as well as
business people, entrepreneurs, agency scientists, and anyone with an
interest in science. Support for building the science.gov gateway came
from "CENDI," an interagency committee of senior managers of Federal
science and technology information programs.<?p>

<p>"Science.gov provides the unique ability to search across the content
within databases as well as across Web sites," said Eleanor Frierson,
Deputy Director of the National Agricultural Library and co-chair of the
science.gov Alliance, the interagency group that created science.gov.
"It shows that Federal agencies can work together to pull off something
none of them could do individually."</p>

<p>The agencies participating in science.gov are the Departments of
Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human
Services, and Interior; the Environmental Protection Agency; the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science
Foundation.</p>

<h4>The British Library, Adobe and Elsevier Science set standard for secure EDD</h4>

<p>The British Library Press - 3 December 2002: &quot; Groundbreaking work by the British Library and Adobe®, unveiled today at 
  Online 2002, combines the Library's expertise and Adobe's encryption technology 
  to set a new standard for secure electronic document delivery (EDD) services.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;The British Library, one of the world's leading document suppliers, has integrated 
  Adobe Content Server® encryption and Adobe Acrobat&reg; eBook Reader&reg; software into 
  its electronic document delivery operations, allowing customers of the Library's 
  <B>inside</B> service to order PDF files of articles from Elsevier Science and 
  other publishers on a strict pay-per-view basis.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;Until now publishers and document supply companies have had difficulty enforcing 
  copyright and managing rights in the digital environment. Working together, 
  the British Library and Elsevier Science have used Adobe's technology to answer 
  publishers' needs - ensuring the secure delivery of articles.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;The British Library's approach has won the endorsement of Elsevier Science, 
  the world's leading publisher of scientific, technical and medical information 
  products and services. Elsevier Science will make articles from 1,700 of its 
  titles available in PDF format to the Library's document supply customers. Titles 
  covered by the agreement include well-known journals such as <EM>The Lancet, 
  Tetrahedron</EM> and <EM>Brain Research</EM>, through to more specialist periodicals.&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;The British Library can now supply PDF files of journal articles from over 
  2,500 key titles from the top research publishers (including 800 titles covered 
  by separate deals with S. Karger AG and Kluwer Academic Publishers).&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;Using the Library's <B>inside</B> service, customers can search for relevant 
  articles; select the items they require; and quickly obtain print-quality copies 
  of articles delivered directly to their desktop. Articles can be viewed on screen 
  and printed using Adobe's Acrobat eBook Reader. Prices for the new PDF electronic 
  delivery service include copyright fees and customers can pay using a secure 
  credit card payment facility. In the future, PDF electronic delivery will also 
  be available on other British Library Web-based services.&quot;</p>

<p>For further information, see the full press release at &lt;<a href="http://www.bl.uk/cgi-bin/press.cgi?story=1310.html">http://www.bl.uk/cgi-bin/press.cgi?story=1310</a>&gt;.</p>

<h4>Royal Roads University Plans KM Research Centre</h4>

<p>VICTORIA, CANADA, December 2, 2002 - &quot;Business leaders may soon have a new think tank to boost
their companies' know-how. Royal Roads University is expected to announce
the creation of a research centre for knowledge-based leadership in January
when the university launches its' first master's program in knowledge
management.&quot;</p> 

<P>&quot;'More and more business leaders see that their workers must share their
collective know-how if their organizations are to thrive,' said Steve
Grundy, dean of the science, technology and environment division at Royal
Roads. 'It's no accident that Nobel Prize winners come from rich networks of
people who share their smarts and passion.'&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;Several representatives from Royal Roads have hit the road across Canada
this month to gauge support for the new think tank. It will be created when
the university achieves a critical mass of interest and support from 15 to
20 companies&#151;including two to four collaborative partners.&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;Research at the new centre would focus on critical issues identified by
stakeholder organizations engaged in knowledge initiatives.  These may
include:</p>
 
<ul><li>what leadership looks like in successful knowledge-based organizations</li>
<li>how to create new knowledge to support innovation</li>
<li>how to compare competing information systems</li>
<li>KM practices for smaller companies and the public sector&quot;</li></ul></p>
 
<P>&quot;Some research studies might even raise eyebrows. 'For example, what role
does storytelling play?' says Alan Breakspear, chief executive officer of
Ottawa's Ibis Research Inc. and chair of Royal Roads' advisory board on
knowledge management. 'And what can organizations and indigenous communities
teach each other about knowledge?'&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;Breakspear says the research centre would hold conferences where corporate
sponsors would kick off studies and hear results a year later. 'You can't
continue to teach forever without replenishing the stock of what you're
teaching. In part, that's what research at a university is about. Royal
Roads has the opportunity&#151;the launch platform of its KM degree programs -
to get into this.'&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;Business and public sector leaders who want to support the new centre or
learn about openings in the university's KM programs should contact Royal
Roads' KM program manager Alice MacGillivray at (250) 391-2600 ext 4139 or

<h4>Columbia University Press to Publish the <em>Journal of Electronic Publishing</em></h4>

<p>The following announcement is from Eve Trager, University of Michigan:</p>

<P>&quot;The <em>Journal of Electronic Publishing</em> and Columbia University Press
announce with pleasure their new partnership. With the release of the
Spring 2003 issue, The <em>Journal of Electronic Publishing</em> (JEP) will be published
by Columbia University Press and will be re-launched with a new design,
augmented content, enhanced search capabilities, and a new home address on

agreed that all archives of the journal will be moved to Columbia, and
calls to the old URL addresses will be automatically redirected to <em>JEP</em>'s
new home. In partnership with Columbia, <em>JEP</em> can reach a far wider
audience, including many of the subscribers to CUP's renowned electronic
publications. William Strachan, director of CUP said, 'This move comes
just as we ready the publication of The Columbia Guide to Digital
Publishing. Columbia's staff and its committee of top experts in the field
of digital publishing will now be available to work with the members of
the <em>JEP</em> staff to strengthen <em>JEP</em>'s position as the definitive journal in
the field.'&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;The <em>Journal of Electronic Publishing</em> has been published since January,
1995. It currently  delivers three issues a year, in April, August, and
December.  Judith Axler Turner and Eve Trager, who both joined the journal
in 1997, will continue in their respective positions of editor and
managing editor. <em>JEP</em> is available by free subscription, and has 1,700
subscribers and thousands more readers, mostly in the publishing industry,
libraries, and the academy. Readers have access to close to 200 articles
written by industry professionals in library science, private publishing,
and academic presses.

<ul class="md"><a name="top">The </a>following small introduction into the archaeology of Ras al-Khaimah was left deliberately without pictures to speed loading. If you are interested to see some finds of the major periods please visit our <a href="arccol.html" class="tu">Archaeological Collections Online.</a></ul>
<p><a name="intro">30 years ago in 1968 </a> Beatrice de Cardi and Brian Doe carried out a survey
of archaeological sites in the Emirate of Ras al-Khaimah. H.H. Sheikh Saqr
bin Mohammed al-Qasimi, Ruler of Ras al-Khaimah, who had always been interested
in a better understanding of the history of the emirate, supported their
work from the beginning and invited them to continue in the following years.
These surveys were the foundation of the Archaeology of Ras al-Khaimah.

<p>Since then the Department of Antiquities and Museums under the direction
of H.H. Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr al-Qasimi has enlarged the knowledge of
the history of Ras al-Khaimah by inviting many experts from all over the
world to conduct further&nbsp; surveys and to start excavations on important
archaeological sites.

<p>This work gave a better understanding of the history of the last 7000
years, which led in 1987 to the inauguration of the National Museum of
Ras al-Khaimah, established in the old fortress and former palace of the
ruling family.

<p>Within the United Arab Emirates Ras al-Khaimah owns a unique archaeological
heritage, having a complete historical background presented in its archaeology.
One of the main reasons, why this area has always been important for settlement
is its combination of all the four types of landscapes that can be found
in the United Arab Emirates: the fertile plain, the mountain region, the
coastal region and the desert environment. The interaction of these different
regions, together with their individual lifestyle, formed the very special
heritage of the Emirate of Ras al-Kaimah. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="ubaid"><b>The Ubaid Period</b></a> (5000 - 3800 BC) is the oldest period known
in Ras al-Khaimah. Large shell middens and surface collections near Jazirat
al-Hamra gave the first hint of human activities at these places. The finds
of pottery, beads, net sinkers and flint tools represent the former presence
of a nomadic population living at the coast during the summer months. Their
pottery shows parallels with that of&nbsp; Mesopotamia from the same period
and indicates trade contacts as early as this time. Other sites with flint
tools were found near to the fertile plain of Khatt. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="hafit">During the <b>Hafit Period</b></a> (3200 - 2600 BC) burial cairns built
on high mountain plateau are the most prominent features in Ras al-Khaimah.
Made from local stone, they originally had the appearance of a beehive
and consisted of a small chamber for one to two burials. These structures
have been located in Khatt, in the mountains above Ras al-Khaimah and in
Wadi al-Bih, as well as in Wadi al-Qawr, where two Hafit tombs were excavated
by English archaeologists (Carl Phillips). <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="uan">The middle</a> of the third millennium BC saw the rise of the <b>Umm al-Nar</b> Culture (2600 - 2000 BC), the most important period concerning the development
of civilisation in the UAE. Evidence suggests that trade in copper with
Mesopotamia and the Indus valley made the area of the United Arab Emirates
wealthy during that period and Mesopotamian sources mentioned it as the
�Land of Magan�.

<p>The trade is reflected in various finds from a settlement in Asimah
as well as from several tombs of that period. Besides locally produced
pottery of very high quality, we find pottery from south-eastern Iran,
the Indus valley, Mesopotamia and Bahrain, at that time known as Dilmun.
This imported pottery shows very clearly, that the Ras al-Khaimah sites
have been part of a large network of long distance trade.

<p>The Umm al-Nar Period is well known for its circular tombs. The outer
walls were faced with well-shaped and smoothed ashlars (facing-stones),
internally the tombs&nbsp;&nbsp; had been divided into several chambers.
They were used for collective burial purposes, not single burials, probably
by group of people, most likely a large family, who used them for several
generations. In some cases archaeologists found the remains of more than
100 people buried in one Umm al-Nar tomb.

<p>The two largest graves were found in the area of Shimal. The first one
has been excavated by the German Mission from the University of Goettingen.
The other tomb, with a diameter of 14,5 m is the largest Umm al-Nar tomb
known so far on the Oman peninsula. It was discovered in 1997 and excavations
will be resumed after the end of Eid. One of its facing stones bears a
carved footprint, being the first carved Umm al-Nar facing stones found
in the northern part of the United Arab Emirates.

<p>Another tomb was found by the British Mission in Wadi Muna�i in the
southern part of Ras al-Khaimah. In 1988 rescue excavations revealed a
large stone alignment with tombs of the late Umm al-Nar period in Asimah
close to Masafi. An important assemblage of bronze implements was discovered
there including a bronze goblet, socketed spear-heads and dagger blades. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="ws">The </a>beginning of the second millennium BC is marked in the UAE by a
sudden change in settlement pattern, style of pottery and tombs. This period,
called the <b>Wadi Suq Period</b> (2000-1600 BC), is represented in Ras
al-Khaimah by a large number of graves. More than 150 large Wadi Suq tombs
are situated in Shimal forming the largest cemetery of prehistoric graves
found in the Oman Peninsula. Several other cemeteries were found near Ghalilah,&nbsp;
Qurm, Dhayah, Rams, Qarn al-Harf, Khatt and Idhn. Shimal was discovered
by Beatrice de Cardi and the first tombs were excavated by the English
archaeologist Peter Donaldson on behalf of the Department of Antiquities
and Museums in 1976. Between 1985 and 1990 a German Mission from the University
of Goettingen started a large excavation project and several tombs were
excavated in Shimal as well as in Dhayah. On behalf of the Department of
Antiquities and Museums further Wadi Suq tombs were excavated during 1995/1996
in Idhn and Shimal by a German Mission from the German Archaeological Institute
Sanaa, Yemen Republic.

<p>Most of the Wadi Suq tombs are large above ground structures built of
local limestone - boulders, consisting of one to two chambers with an average
length of 8-10 m. Again these monuments are collective tombs, used over
a long period of time. Between 30 - 60 people were found buried in one
grave. Smaller tombs, built only for a single person, were excavated in
Wadi Muna�i by a team of British archaeologists under the direction of
Carl Phillips. All the tombs contained special grave-goods which are typical
of the Wadi Suq Period: painted beakers and&nbsp; spouted jars, incised
stone bowls and vessels with lids, personal ornaments such as beads, metal
tools and weapons. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="lba">The </a>second half of the second millennium BC,&nbsp; the<b> late Bronze
Age</b> (1600-1250 BC) is known from a settlement in the Shimal area, which
has been partly excavated by the German Mission of the University of Goettingen.
Built at the foot of&nbsp; the rising mountains it showed traces of a typical
�arish� style housing, typical in the United Arab Emirates until 50 years
ago. Large amounts of shells and fishbones showed that the people relied
on the Creek area, which was probably not far away. Dates and animal bones
proved that farming was common as well. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="iron"><b>The Iron Age</b></a> (1250-300 BC) is best known from the southern part
of Ras al-Khaimah. The first surveys were carried out by Beatrice de Cardi
in the Wadi al-Qawr and Wadi Muna�i area and were later followed by excavations
of British archaeologists. Several large subterranean tombs were found.
They all belonged to small farming villages on the terraces of the wadis.
Again these tombs were built for a large group of people, who buried their
dead together.

<p>All the tombs were cut into the gravel of the wadi bank, the chambers
were lined&nbsp; with stones, had an entrance and showed a broad variety
of shapes. A horse-shoe shaped tomb was found in Fashqa, a large circular
structure in Naslah and a rectangular tomb with four chambers in Wa�ab.
Beside the typical pottery vessels of that period, such as painted and
undecorated bowls, a vast number of carved and decorated stone vessels
were found. Their large number and size (several hundred vessels and lids
are now in the museum collection) led to the assumption, that the source
of the stone material called �chlorite� must have been somewhere in that
area. A special find was a stonevessel incised with a griffin, very similar
to the large carved griffins found on stone-slabs in Neo-Assyrian palaces
in Northern Iraq.

<p>Beside the tombs a fortification on a high ridge near Rafaq in the Wadi
al-Qawr was excavated. During the Iron Age it had protected the dense settled
area of the Wadi.

<p>In the northern part of Ras al-Khaimah two important settlements in
the shape of a huge mound (Tell) could be found. One Tell situated near
Khatt called Nud Ziba was discovered in 1968 by Beatrice de Cardi, the
other was recently discovered by the Department of Antiquities and Museums
in the Shimal area. These settlements demonstrate a presence and occupation
of the northern part of Ras al-Khaimah during the Iron Age. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="pia">The </a>later pre-Islamic times, the <b>Hellenistic and Parthian Period</b>
(300 BC to 300 AD) are evident in the northern part of Ras al-Khaimah.
Several sites were found during surveys conducted by the Department of
Antiquities and Museums, as well as the remains of burials, found in Shimal,
Asimah and in Wa�ab/Wadi Muna�i. These were single burials, that very often
re-used older tombs. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="sas">A <b>Sassanian</b></a> occupation (300-632 AD) on Ras al-Khaimah territory
is becoming increasingly evident. The archaeologist J. Hansman excavated
a small site on the island of Hulaylah, that has been occupied during the
Sassanian Period. Recently two sites were found at Khatt, where small excavations
were conducted. The most interesting find of recent years was made by the
on-going excavations at Kush, excavated by a British team. After three
seasons of excavations it seems certain, that the site was founded as a
Sassanian fortress, built to control the fertile plains around the northern
part of the Emirate. It was probably abandoned at the time Islam came to
the area of the United Arab Emirates. For the early as well as the later
Islamic Periods Ras al-Khaimah is the most important emirate concerning
its archaeological heritage. The early centuries of Islam are well presented
at the tell of Kush and the area of the island of Hulaylah. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>

<br>&nbsp;
<br><a name="abas"><b>The Abbasid period </b></a>(750-1250 AD) saw the largest extent of an
unified Islamic empire and a huge increase in trade with eastern Asia.
It is represented by only a few sites in the whole Gulf area. This makes
the two sites in Ras al-Khaimah even more important in order to understand
the trade routes and the trade goods in the early centuries of Islam.

<p>In Kush it seems that after the Sassanians abandoned their fortress,
settlers were re-using the older structures and lived in that area for
the next 700 years. While mud-brick buildings were found in Kush, the island
of Hulaylah were probably settled with �arish� style buildings, leaving
less visible but nonetheless very important remains. Both sites are only
a few kilometers apart and can probably be identified with the area of
ancient Julfar, an important town, known from Islamic geographers like
al-Muqdasi in the 10th century and al-Idrisi in the 12th century. Finds
of Chinese porcelain at both sites, as well as Abbasid pottery imported
from Iraq and other areas show that the people living in Julfar were heavily
involved in trade. Of particular interest was the recovery of seeds from
the settlements and probably the oldest coffee bean in the world was found
in a 12th-century living area at Kush. This is already two centuries earlier,
than historical sources tell us about the use and trade of coffee. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="islam"><b>The later Islamic Period </b></a>(14th - 19th Century). By the middle
of the 14th century Kush and Jazirat al-Hulayla were abandoned and the
people settled on a sandbar, at that time in front of the coast. This settlement
took the name Julfar as well and is still called that.

<p>This place was also identified by Beatrice de Cardi in 1968 and up to
now several excavations have been tak en place at Julfar. The first one
was conducted by an Iraqi team, followed by John Hansman in 1976/77. A
trial trench dug by the Department of Antiquities and Museums in 1988 was
followed by large-scale excavations undertaken on an international basis
between 1989 and 1994. Involved were Archaeological Missions from France
(Claire Hardy-Gilbert), Britain (Geoffrey King) Japanese (Tatsui Sasaki)
and Germany (Michael Janssen). They all proved that Julfar was a large
settlement used between the 14th and the 17th century. The city was built
of mudbrick houses and the remains of a mosque and a fortress were found.
Julfar was defended by a large mudbrick wall, about 2,5 m thick and about
4 m high, being the major trading centre in the lower part of the Gulf.
Well known from Arabic and European sources, Julfar was of importance far
beyond the Gulf area and more or less the equivalent of modern Dubai. Large
amounts of imported Chinese porcelain as well as other pottery showed the
long-range trade involved. The home of merchants and seafarers, it seems,
that the most famous of all Arabic seafarer, Bin Majid, came from Julfar.

<p>The large town was supported by a number of villages situated in the
fertile plain along the mountains and it seems that in this period the
numerous small settlements with terraced fields in the Hajjar mountains
were founded.
<br>At the same time the area of Shimal and&nbsp; Wadi Haqil was a major
production centre of a special pottery, which was distributed to all parts
of the United Arab Emirates. For more than 500 years production went on
and the last kilns in Wadi Haqil were abandoned only one generation ago.
The ethnographic section of the Museum&nbsp; shows the broad range of vessels
from coffee pots to large storage jars, which were produced in the last
centuries. <a href="#top" class="tu">Back to top</a>


<p><a name="recent">Even the more <b>Recent History</b></a> (19th &amp; 20th Century) is well
presented in the National Museum of Ras al-Khaimah. In the last years the
Department of Antiquities and Museums has conducted several surveys to
collect the data for traditional buildings. 75 standing towers built of
mud-brick or stone and mortar were registered during a survey carried out
few years ago.. Recently a survey concernig the existence of old mosques
located more than 20 examples, which were older than 30 years. They have
been recorded, planned and photographed by a Belgian team and reflect the&nbsp;
unique and important architectural tradition of religious buildings in
the United Arab Emirates in general and the Emirate of Ras al-Khaimah in
particular.

<p>The Department of Antiquities and Museums will do further work to throw
light on the rich history of Ras al-Khaimah and to provide a better understanding
of the past.

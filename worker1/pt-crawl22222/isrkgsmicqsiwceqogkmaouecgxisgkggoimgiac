Despite a clear strategic imperative for abandoning Iran&#39;s claim to Bahrain in the wake of the British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, the Shah feared that such an act would be seen by the Iranian public as collusion with the British to surrender Iranian territory, thereby further eroding the Pahlavi monarchy&#39;s precarious legitimacy.

                                                      Shah of Iran, in the secret Anglo-Iranian negotiations over Bahrain from January

                                                      claim to Bahrain in the wake of the British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, the

                                                      Shah feared that such an act would be seen by the Iranian public as collusion with
                                                      the British to surrender Iranian territory, thereby further eroding the Pahlavi
                                                      monarchy’s precarious legitimacy. Drawing on British official papers and Iranian
                                                      oral histories and memoirs, this paper explores for the first time the story of these
                                                      secret negotiations and the extent to which the Shah’s diplomacy was constrained
                                                      by domestic considerations.



                                                      In March 1970, following 26 months of secret Anglo-Iranian negotiations, Shah
                                                      Muhammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran abandoned his country’s historic claim to

                                                      these negotiations, viewing them as a footnote in the story of Britain’s withdrawal
                                                      from the Persian Gulf between 1968 and 1971.2 Yet the Shah’s decision to
                                                      abandon Iran’s claim to Bahrain marked a turning point in Arab– Iranian relations
                                                      during the Cold War, setting the stage for Iran’s emergence as the leading power of

                                                      the conduct of Iranian diplomacy under Muhammad Reza Shah. The image of the

                                                      insecure monarch, profoundly sensitive to the verdict of Iranian public opinion in
                                                      the conduct of his foreign policy.3 Indeed, the substance of these long and
                                                      torturous Anglo-Iranian negotiations focused on finding a face-saving formula for
                                                      the Shah to abandon Bahrain without appearing to have colluded with Britain to
                                                      surrender Iranian territory. Despite the Shah’s calculation that the abandonment of
                                                      Bahrain was necessary for ensuring regional security in the wake of Britain’s
                                                      withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, it took 26 months of secret negotiations with the
                                                      British for the Shah to agree to a mechanism that would allow him to abandon
                                                      Bahrain without further eroding his waning domestic legitimacy.
                                                         During the early Cold War, the security provided by Britain’s military presence
                                                      in the Persian Gulf afforded Iranian statesmen the freedom to focus on the
                                                      immediate threat posed by the Soviet Union to Iran’s northern border following

                                                      Suez crisis. During his visit to Britain in March 1965, the Shah conveyed to Prime
                                                      Minister Harold Wilson his fear that a British withdrawal from the Gulf would
                                                      create a power vacuum that the radical Arab states and their Soviet patrons would
                                                      seek to fill.5 Following Britain’s ignoble withdrawal from Aden in November
                                                      1967, Goronwy Roberts, a junior Minister in the British Foreign Office, was
                                                      dispatched to reassure the Gulf’s rulers that Britain had no intention of
                                                      withdrawing from the region.6
                                                         The decline of Britain’s power in the Gulf coincided with two important trends
                                                      in Iranian foreign policy in the 1960s. First, the Shah sought to diminish Iran’s
                                                      dependence on the United States in favour of an ‘Independent National Policy’,
                                                      which he defined as ‘defending our country with our own capabilities and power’.7
                                                      The Shah could afford this newfound assertiveness thanks to a dramatic rise in
                                                      Iran’s oil revenues, which increased 25-fold between 1955 and 1968 from $33
                                                      million to $837.5 million. Iranian government spending increased seven-fold in
                                                      that same period, and by 1968 American aid accounted for less than six per cent of
                                                      Iranian government spending.8 Second, throughout the 1960s, Iran’s attention
                                                      increasingly turned from the Soviet threat from the north to the Arab threat from
                                                      the south. The Shah’s 1962 pledge to the Soviet Union that no foreign (i.e.
                                                      American) military bases would be allowed on Iranian soil led to a warming of
                                                      Soviet– Iranian relations, culminating in a number of technical and economic
                                                      agreements and a symbolic sale of around $100 million worth of unsophisticated
                                                      Soviet military hardware to Iran in 1966.9 As the direct Soviet threat diminished,

                                                      the Shah became more concerned with the indirect threat posed by radical Arab
                                                      states, principally Egypt and Iraq, to stability in the Gulf. Iran and the radical
                                                      Arabs found themselves on opposite sides of the Cold War divide. While Iran had
                                                      allied with Britain in the 1955 Baghdad Pact and signed a defence agreement with
                                                      the United States in 1959, Egypt, Syria and later Iraq rejected the Baghdad Pact
                                                      and instead accepted Soviet patronage.
                                                         Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser portrayed the Shah as a Persian
                                                      imperialist who had allied himself with western imperialism and Zionism against
                                                      the Arab Nation. The Shah was alarmed by Egypt’s deployment in 1962 of
                                                      50,000 troops to support the Soviet-backed republicans in the civil war in North
                                                      Yemen.10 Another source of concern was that the People’s Democratic Republic
                                                      of Yemen (PDRY), which emerged in South Yemen following Britain’s
                                                      withdrawal from Aden in 1967, was funnelling Chinese and Soviet aid to the

                                                      pursue Arab territorial claims on Iran’s southern province of Khuzistan where
                                                      much of Iran’s oil reserves are located.12 As oil revenues accounted for more than
                                                      38 per cent of Iranian government spending in 1968, the stability and security of
                                                      the Gulf was vital for Iran.13 The Shah was keen to cultivate good relations with
                                                      the conservative Arab rulers of the Gulf, whom he invited regularly to Iran for
                                                      vacations and hunting trips. SAVAK,14 the Iranian intelligence service, had
                                                      established stations throughout the Lower Gulf and kept a close eye on all anti-
                                                      Iranian activities on the southern shore.15
                                                         These two trends in Iranian foreign policy framed the Shah’s reaction to the
                                                      Wilson Government’s announcement on 16 January 1968 that all British forces
                                                      ‘East of Suez’, including the Gulf, would be withdrawn by 1971. The British
                                                      Cabinet’s decision to cut defence spending was driven by the governing Labour
                                                      Party’s desire to achieve fiscal austerity in the face of severe economic pressure,
                                                      while avoiding painful cuts in social spending.16 Britain’s withdrawal posed a
                                                      major policy challenge for Iran, as the radical Arabs and their Soviet patrons
                                                      would undoubtedly hope to fill the power vacuum left by the British. The United
                                                      States, embroiled in the Vietnam conflict, was unable to take over the role
                                                      abandoned by Britain in the Gulf. As early as 1966, the Americans had expressed
                                                      their preference for a regional defence arrangement, and on 29 January 1968 US
                                                      Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow publicly backed the idea of regional
                                                      security grouping involving Iran.17

                                                         Consistent with his ‘Independent National Policy,’ the Shah was anxious for Iran
                                                      to assume the leadership role in the Gulf abandoned by Britain and rejected by the
                                                      United States. When Goronwy Roberts returned to Tehran on 7 January 1968 to
                                                      inform the Shah of Britain’s dramatic policy reversal, the Shah proposed that Iran,
                                                      Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and even Iraq should work together to provide aerial and
                                                      naval patrols of the waterway and consider signing a formal defence agreement.18
                                                      Indeed, Iran had been steadily augmenting its naval capabilities in the Gulf in
                                                      anticipation of such a role, including an order for four British destroyers in
                                                      February 1967.19 On the eve of the British withdrawal, Tehran, London and
                                                      Washington all supported a regional defence arrangement in the Gulf. The
                                                      principal obstacle to such Arab– Iranian cooperation was the outstanding border
                                                      disputes between Iran and her Arab neighbours, particularly on the Bahrain
                                                      question.20 There was therefore a clear strategic imperative for Iran to abandon its
                                                      claim to Bahrain in order to foster Arab– Iranian security cooperation in the Gulf in

                                                         Iran claimed to have exercised uninterrupted sovereignty over Bahrain since the
                                                      pre-Islamic era, except for the period of Portuguese occupation from 1522 to 1602.
                                                      Once Iran recaptured Bahrain from the Portuguese in 1602, it exercised
                                                      sovereignty over the archipelago until it was invaded by the al-Khalifah clan of the
                                                      Utubi tribe of Arabia in 1783. Based on a series of treaties and agreements signed
                                                      between the al-Khalifah and the British in the nineteenth century, Britain
                                                      recognized Bahrain as a ‘sovereign state in special treaty relations’ with Britain.
                                                      Throughout the nineteenth century, Iran protested to London over these treaties;
                                                      and in November 1927 took its dispute with Britain to the League of Nations,
                                                      without resolution. The issue re-emerged in 1951 when Iran demanded that the oil
                                                      nationalization laws passed by the Mosaddeq Government be applied not only to
                                                      the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company but also to the Bahrain Petroleum Company,
                                                      on the grounds that Bahrain was Iranian territory. Again, in November 1957, when
                                                      the Iranian Government redrew Iran’s provincial boundaries, it separated Bahrain
                                                      from the province of Fars and declared it Iran’s 14th province.21
                                                         However, in Muhammad Reza Shah’s estimation, Bahrain was of little
                                                      economic or strategic value to Iran. As the Shah explained to Amir Khosrow
                                                      Afshar, then Permanent Secretary of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Bahrain’s oil
                                                      reserves were small and its once thriving pearl industry had declined. The
                                                      archipelago lay in the far south of the Gulf so it would be of little value in
                                                      securing the Strait of Hormuz, which was Iran’s paramount concern. Moreover,
                                                      any Iranian military intervention in Bahrain would probably result in violence and
                                                      civil strife.22 In his March 1965 meeting with Wilson, the Shah assured the
                                                      British that he had no intention of using force to resolve the Bahrain question.23

                                                      This was in stark contrast to his views on the Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the
                                                      Greater and Lesser Tunbs,24 which were claimed by both Iran and the British
                                                      Protected States of Sharjah and Ras Al-Khaimah. The Shah considered these
                                                      Islands to be strategically vital given their proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, and
                                                      made it clear to Goronwy Roberts in their January 1968 meeting that if Iran could
                                                      not reach an agreement with the Protected States on their conflicting claims, he
                                                      was willing to unilaterally deploy troops on these Islands.25 Given his willingness
                                                      to abandon Iran’s claim to Bahrain and his determination to enforce Iranian
                                                      sovereignty over the Islands, the Shah clearly hoped that such a quid pro quo
                                                      could be achieved as part of a ‘package deal’ with the British. While such a deal
                                                      was never struck in the course of the Bahrain negotiations, the issue did emerge
                                                      periodically throughout the talks with the British.26
                                                         By the 1960s the notion of Bahrain as Iranian territory had, in the words of one
                                                      Iranian journalist and publisher of the day, ‘entered the subconscious of the Iranian
                                                      people’.27 A consensus existed, particularly among Iranian intellectuals, that
                                                      Iran’s historical and legal claim to Bahrain was irrefutable.28 The Bahrain question

                                                      was particularly emotive as it involved a dispute with Britain, an imperial power
                                                      that had deeply penetrated Iran’s political and economic life for much of the
                                                      nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A succession of British envoys in Iran attest to
                                                      the popular Iranian perception of perfidious Albion as the sinister hidden hand in
                                                      Iranian politics.29 Britain’s role in overthrowing the nationalist Mosaddeq
                                                      Government in 1953 and restoring the Shah to power not only entrenched this
                                                      widespread Anglophobia, but also eroded Muhammad Reza Shah’s nationalist
                                                      credentials.30 The Shah made efforts to bolster his image as an authentic Iranian
                                                      nationalist by contrasting his ‘positive nationalism’, which he defined as ‘a policy
                                                      of maximum political and economic independence’, with Mosaddeq’s
                                                      ‘negativism’, which had ‘led straight to the sort of political and economic chaos
                                                      which foreign agents found ideal for their purposes’.31 Therefore, despite the
                                                      strategic imperatives for giving up the claim to Bahrain, any appearance of
                                                      collusion with the British to surrender Bahrain would have further jeopardized the
                                                      Shah’s domestic legitimacy. Writing only a few years after the Bahrain

                                                      negotiations were concluded, Shahram Chubin suggested that there were certain
                                                      domestic constraints on the Shah’s ability to relinquish the claim to Bahrain.32
                                                      With the passage of nearly 40 years and the availability of British official papers
                                                      and Iranian oral histories we can now examine how these domestic factors
                                                      constrained the Shah’s decision-making on the Bahrain question.
                                                         The intermittent Anglo-Iranian negotiations on Bahrain can be separated into
                                                      five stages. From January to August 1968, the discussions focused on the Shah’s
                                                      demand for a plebiscite in Bahrain. From August to December 1968, as Iran’s
                                                      relations with the Arab states gradually improved, the negotiations culminated in
                                                      the Shah’s decision to forgo a plebiscite. The major turning point came with the
                                                      Shah’s 6 January 1969 New Delhi statement, when he publicly committed himself
                                                      to relinquishing Iran’s claim to Bahrain. From January to August 1969, the British
                                                      and Iranians focused on the idea of a UN Mission going to Bahrain to ascertain the
                                                      wishes of the Bahraini people, thereby providing the Shah with a face-saving
                                                      mechanism to abandon Iran’s claim. Although the negotiations ground to a halt in

                                                      the summer over the UN Mission’s method of procedure, the impasse was broken
                                                      and from September to December 1969 discussions on the details of the UN
                                                      Mission continued, culminating in the joint informal approach to UN Secretary-
                                                      General U. Thant on 28 December. From December 1969 to March 1970, the talks
                                                      centred on the wording of the formal Iranian approach to U. Thant, which finally
                                                      took place on 9 March 1970, thus ending the negotiations.
                                                         The negotiations began with Goronwy Roberts’ audience with the Shah on 7
                                                      January 1968, where he conveyed Britain’s decision to leave the Gulf by 1971.
                                                      The Shah expressed to Roberts his desire to find a face-saving way for him
                                                      to abandon Iran’s claim to Bahrain. ‘Thinking aloud’, he posited that ‘some
                                                      presentational device’ was needed and suggested that a ‘plebiscite’ be held in
                                                      Bahrain to ascertain whether the Bahrainis wished to be part of Iran or not.33 If, as
                                                      expected, the Bahrainis voted for independence from Iran, the Shah could then
                                                      portray his relinquishment of Iran’s claim to Bahrain as his magnanimous
                                                      acquiescence to the desire of the Bahraini people for self-determination, rather
                                                      than collusion with Britain to surrender Iranian territory. Sir Denis Wright, the
                                                      British Ambassador in Tehran, recorded in his 1968 annual review that the Shah’s
                                                      paramount fear was that he would ‘go down in history as the man who lightly
                                                      abandoned his country’s “14th Province”’.34 Both the British and the al-Khalifah
                                                      were opposed to a plebiscite, fearing that it would ignite sectarian tensions
                                                      in Bahrain where the ruling al-Khalifah dynasty were Sunni Muslims but
                                                      the majority of the population were Shi‘i Muslims as in neighbouring Iran.
                                                      A plebiscite on whether or not to be part of Iran could easily become a referendum
                                                      on the Shi‘i or Sunni character of Bahrain. As Roberts explained to the Shah, a
                                                      plebiscite would ‘unleash forces’ of sectarianism and ‘increase the danger’ of
                                                      instability in Bahrain and the Gulf.35
                                                         The persistence of the Iranian claim to Bahrain hampered Iranian efforts to
                                                      pursue regional cooperation in the wake of the British decision to withdraw. The
                                                      Shah had received the Ruler of Kuwait in Tehran in January 1968 and was set to

                                                      make a state visit to Saudi Arabia to discuss the future of the Gulf with King
                                                      Faisal. However, on 17 January, at the conclusion of a three-day visit to Saudi
                                                      Arabia by Sheikh Issa, the Ruler of Bahrain, the Saudis declared that they would
                                                      ‘fully endorse and effectively support the Bahrayn [sic ] government in all
                                                      circumstances’. They also proposed building a causeway linking Bahrain to Saudi
                                                      Arabia. The Shah interpreted these Saudi moves as a repudiation of Iran’s claim to
                                                      Bahrain and promptly cancelled his impending trip to Saudi Arabia.36 Iran’s
                                                      relations with the Arabs continued to deteriorate due to the Bahrain issue, and
                                                      Tehran increasingly took a unilateral, rather than multilateral, approach to regional
                                                      security. On 27 January, Iranian Prime Minister Amir Abbas Hoveyda declared
                                                      that Iran was the ‘most powerful’ state in the Gulf and that ‘there is no doubt’ that
                                                      Iran would defend her ‘rights’ in the region. He emphasized that Britain could not
                                                      ‘leave through the front door only to re-enter through the back door’, a reference to
                                                      British collusion with the Arab rulers of the Gulf. Hoveyda stressed that Gulf
                                                      security was the exclusive responsibility of the littoral states and that external

                                                      powers should be excluded.37
                                                         The prospects for any Anglo-Iranian deal on Bahrain suffered a major blow
                                                      when Britain supported the 26 February 1968 announcement by Bahrain, the
                                                      Trucial States, and Qatar that they would unite to form a single Arab federation.
                                                      The Iranians interpreted Britain’s support for the inclusion of Bahrain as an
                                                      attempt to make Bahrain’s independence from Iran a fait accompli. They were
                                                      convinced that the British were behind the federation idea and denounced this
                                                      attempt by Britain to unilaterally hand over Iranian territory to the Arabs. The
                                                      Shah made his displeasure clear in a speech in Isfahan on 13 March. Clearly
                                                      frustrated that Iran’s calls for regional cooperation had been rebuffed, and angry at
                                                      the Anglo-Arab collusion on Bahrain, the Shah declared that Iran would:
                                                         reciprocate in kind to foreign attitudes towards us, not that the other should expect
                                                         unreserved friendship from us in exchange perhaps for a glance of affection. I must also
                                                         declare here that if ever our present friends do not respect our interests, especially in the
                                                         Persian Gulf, they should expect a similar attitude on our part.38
                                                         Aware of the Shah’s anger and suspicion, Ambassador Wright sought to ‘play
                                                      for time’ in the hope that ‘second thoughts will prevail here as they have done
                                                      so often in the past’.39 British Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart instructed
                                                      Wright to tell the Shah that Britain was examining the possibility of a ‘package
                                                      deal’ involving a renunciation of Iran’s claim to Bahrain in exchange for the return
                                                      of the Islands to Iran. However, he instructed Wright to avoid raising the Shah’s
                                                      expectations too high. Instead, he should point out ‘that Bahrain, Abu Musa and
                                                      the Tunbs affect three different Arab states and cannot be packaged arbitrarily by
                                                      H.M.G.’.40 The British proposal was met with lukewarm enthusiasm by the Shah.
                                                      A package deal would do little to assuage his fears about the verdict of Iranian
                                                      public opinion. When Wright questioned the extent to which Iranian public
                                                      opinion was even aware of the issue, the Shah disagreed, arguing that the Foreign

                                                      Ministry and the armed forces were certainly aware.41 In London, some in the
                                                      Foreign Office wondered whether the Shah’s concerns about public opinion were a
                                                      ‘disingenuous’ negotiating tactic.42 After all, what would he have to fear from
                                                      Iran’s state-controlled media and muzzled domestic opposition? From his vantage
                                                      point in Tehran, Wright forcefully argued that the Shah was ‘perfectly sincere’
                                                      when expressing his fears, and had often told him that:
                                                           in this singularly ungrateful country he cannot for one moment afford to give the
                                                           impression that he is slipping, going soft, giving things away, etc. or everyone would be at
                                                           his throat. These dangers may exist merely in his own mind only, but they are very real to
                                                           him.43
                                                      In effect, it did not matter whether domestic opposition to abandoning Bahrain was
                                                      real or apparent. What mattered was that the Shah, Iran’s sole foreign policy
                                                      decision-maker, was convinced that public opinion would be against the decision.
                                                         There was little hope that a ‘package deal’ could provide a solution to the
                                                      Bahrain question. The British were not sincere in offering a deal, as they had no

                                                      intention of compelling the Protected States to acquiesce to Iran’s seizure of Abu
                                                      Musa and the Tunbs. Stewart had written in March 1968 of the difficulties for
                                                      Britain ‘in appearing to encourage the surrender of Arab territory’.44 Furthermore,
                                                      a package deal did little to allay the Shah’s fears about the verdict of Iranian public
                                                      opinion. Consequently, by early August 1968 the negotiations were paralysed.
                                                      On 6 August the Shah received Wright in Ramsar on the Caspian shore where the
                                                      Monarch was vacationing. Wright recounted that, in their discussions, the Shah
                                                      insisted on a plebiscite in Bahrain on the grounds that:
                                                           it would not be enough to tell his people that Bahrain’s oil was running out and her pearls
                                                           had already done so. He must be able to say that the majority of Bahrainis had expressed a
                                                           wish for independence from Iran.
                                                      The Shah warned that if the proposed Arab federation declared independence with
                                                      Bahrain as a member, Iran would oppose them, and that if Bahrain independently
                                                      became a member of the UN, Iran would leave the world body.45
                                                         Despite the setbacks of the spring, Iran launched a diplomatic offensive in the
                                                      summer to improve relations with her Arab neighbours. In August 1968 the
                                                      Iranians agreed, through Kuwaiti mediation, to secret face-to-face talks in Geneva
                                                      between the Iranian Foreign Minister and the Deputy Ruler of Bahrain.46 Foreign
                                                      Minister Ardeshir Zahedi, one of the most hawkish voices in Tehran on the
                                                      Bahrain issue, delayed the meeting for some months. He had famously flown into a
                                                      rage at a reception at the British Embassy in Tehran on 11 November 1967, when
                                                      Goronwy Roberts had expressed support for Bahrain’s membership in some of the
                                                      specialized agencies of the United Nations. Zahedi warned Roberts that, ‘if this is
                                                      the way you are going to behave, I shall resign, take a gun, sail there [Bahrain], and
                                                      fight for the beloved’. Recalling Zahedi’s reference to ‘the beloved’, Wright

                                                      mischievously recorded that ‘Those of us present who knew about Mr. Zahedi’s
                                                      hobbies had to restrain ourselves from asking “is she blonde or brunette?”’.47
                                                      Zahedi’s relations with Wright were strained throughout his tenure as Foreign
                                                      Minister.48 Wright’s contempt for the Foreign Minister was palpable in his
                                                      dispatches to London, where he described Zahedi as ‘unbalanced’, ‘thoroughly
                                                      devious and hostile’.49 By the autumn of 1968, when Iran’s diplomatic offensive
                                                      with the Arabs seemed to be bearing fruit, the Shah may well have concluded that
                                                      Zahedi’s difficult relationship with the British Ambassador was an obstacle to
                                                      reaching a settlement with London. This may explain why the Shah appointed
                                                      Zahedi’s deputy, Amir Khosrow Afshar, as the chief Iranian negotiator on
                                                      the Bahrain question. Afshar was the ideal choice as he had previously served as
                                                      Iran’s Ambassador in London and was considered something of an ‘Anglophile’,
                                                      yet he also enjoyed very warm relations with Zahedi who referred to him as his
                                                      ‘cousin’.50

                                                      1968, Afshar suggested three possible mechanisms for the resolution of the
                                                      Bahrain question. The first was a plebiscite, which the Shah had suggested in
                                                      January. The second was to refer the dispute for arbitration to the International
                                                      Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague. The third was to refer the matter to the United
                                                      Nations for mediation. According to both British and Iranian sources, the Iranians
                                                      continued to favour a plebiscite while the Bahrainis vehemently rejected it.
                                                      Although the two parties could not come to any preliminary agreement, they
                                                      decided that these secret bi-lateral contacts should continue.51 The Bahrainis kept
                                                      the British informed of the secret dialogue and, in the subsequent discussions in
                                                      the British Foreign Office, Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart raised the idea
                                                      of mediation by a representative of the UN Secretary-General.52 The British
                                                      were concerned that a plebiscite would be ‘fraught with difficulty and danger’,
                                                      while referral to the ICJ ‘would likely take so long’.53 Lord Caradon, British
                                                      Ambassador to the United Nations in New York, expressed grave doubts about the
                                                      idea of involving a Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General (PRSG),
                                                      but conceded that it ‘would be the form of action least likely to be dangerous’.54
                                                         Nonetheless, for any progress to be made on the UN option, Iran would have to
                                                      drop her demand for a plebiscite. While the Iranians had the same reservations as
                                                      the British about the ICJ and the United Nations, they saw a plebiscite as the only
                                                      face-saving way to abandon the claim to Bahrain. As the Shah explained to Wright
                                                      on 28 October 1968, ‘For the people of Iran to accept the abandonment of their

                                                      claim to Bahrain it was essential that they should realise that it had been dropped
                                                      in conformity with internationally recognised procedures’.55 For the Shah a
                                                      plebiscite was the only way to ensure that the decision bore the stamp of ‘legality
                                                      and recognised procedure’, rather than appearing as ‘the decision of one man’. If
                                                      the British and the Bahrainis would not acquiesce to a plebiscite, the Shah warned,
                                                      Iran would have no choice but to bring a complaint against Britain at the UN
                                                      Security Council.56
                                                         The impasse over the plebiscite issue was finally broken following a
                                                      rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. En route to a state visit to the
                                                      United States, the Shah stopped in Jeddah on 3 June 1968 to meet with King
                                                      Faisal. By August, Saudi– Iranian negotiations were underway on the resolution of
                                                      the long-standing dispute over their maritime border in Gulf, culminating in the
                                                      signing of a continental shelf agreement in October. This cleared the way for the
                                                      Shah’s visit to Saudi Arabia from 9 to 14 November, where the main topic of
                                                      conversation was the future of Bahrain and the Gulf. King Faisal advised the Shah

                                                      that all of the Arab rulers of the Gulf were opposed to a plebiscite in Bahrain, and
                                                      he secured a commitment from the Shah to consider other alternatives.57
                                                         A few weeks later, during discussions between Wright and Senator Abbas
                                                      Masoudi in Tehran, the idea of sending a UN Mission to ascertain the Bahraini
                                                      people’s wishes re-emerged. Masoudi was Vice President of the Iranian Senate
                                                      and publisher of Ettela’at, a national daily newspaper in Iran. He was well
                                                      received by the Arab rulers of the Gulf because of his business interests in their
                                                      sheikhdoms and often served as a back-channel for communications between them
                                                      and the Shah. Wright asked Masoudi to see whether a UN Mission would be
                                                      acceptable to the Shah as an alternative to a plebiscite. Two days later Masoudi
                                                      confirmed that the Shah had approved the idea, ‘provided the findings of any UN
                                                      Mission could be given an internationally recognised legal basis’.58 In his report to
                                                      London, Wright presented the proposal as an Iranian initiative, in the hope of
                                                      winning the support of his Arabist colleagues in the Foreign Office who were more
                                                      sympathetic to the Bahraini position.59 The proposal was in line with the internal
                                                      discussions the British had conducted in October, and the Foreign Secretary
                                                      authorized Wright to pursue the idea, instructing him to secure:
                                                           an understanding with the Shah ab initio that the purpose would be to affirm the ‘Arabism’
                                                           of Bahrain but in such a way as to get the Iranian government off the hook. It would thus
                                                           amount to a prearranged public relations exercise.60
                                                         On Christmas Eve 1968, the Shah confirmed to Wright that he would not insist
                                                      on a plebiscite, or even the mention of the word ‘plebiscite’ in the proposed UN
                                                      Mission’s terms of reference. His sole concern was that the UN Mission should
                                                      determine the ‘will of the people of Bahrain’ in a way that would be ‘legally and
                                                      internationally recognisable’. In a sign of his sincere desire to find a prompt
                                                      solution to the Bahrain question, the Shah informed Wright that he should deal

                                                      only with Afshar, and not the troublesome Zahedi, on this issue.61 Just days earlier,
                                                      the second secret meeting between Afshar and the Bahrainis had taken place in
                                                      Geneva.62 The Bahrainis informed the British that the atmosphere of the talks had
                                                      improved and that the Iranians were determined to resolve the matter as quickly as
                                                      possible. Afshar had agreed that a plebiscite would only lead to confrontation, and
                                                      so the two parties agreed to study the UN option.63 The task ahead was to work out
                                                      the details of the UN exercise. When he returned to Tehran from Geneva, Afshar
                                                      met with Wright and emphasized that the Shah wanted to avoid any appearance of
                                                      collusion between Britain and Iran ‘for domestic reasons’.64
                                                         Prior to January 1969, knowledge of these Anglo-Iranian discussions on
                                                      Bahrain was a tightly kept secret. In Tehran, some Foreign Ministry officials were
                                                      aware that negotiations were being conducted, but only a handful of people had
                                                      any knowledge of the substance of the talks.65 However, the Shah’s intentions
                                                      were made public on 6 January 1969, when during a state visit to India he was
                                                      asked at a press conference in New Delhi about Iran’s claim to Bahrain. He

                                                      responded that Iran could not accept that ‘this island which was separated from our
                                                      country should be just offered by the British to other people at our expense’.
                                                      However, he publicly declared for the first time that, ‘if the people of Bahrain do
                                                      not want to join my country first of all, it is against our principle to use force in
                                                      order to reattach this land of ours’. Iran would not use force because ‘it is not even
                                                      intelligent to try to occupy a land against the will of its people’.66
                                                         The Shah’s New Delhi statement was the major turning point in the negotiations
                                                      with Britain and came as a shock to his advisers, including Zahedi.67 For the first
                                                      time, an Iranian monarch had given public notice that Iran was willing to
                                                      relinquish her claim to Bahrain. After 12 months of Anglo-Iranian discussions and
                                                      two secret meetings with the Bahrainis in Geneva, the Shah had agreed to forgo a
                                                      plebiscite in favour of a UN Mission that would ascertain the wishes of the
                                                      Bahraini people. With his unprecedented New Delhi statement, the Shah sought to
                                                      present his decision as a bold and magnanimous Iranian initiative. In Wright’s
                                                      assessment, the statement was sincere, as the Shah avoided any mention of a
                                                      plebiscite, in line with his private understanding with the British.68
                                                         Having agreed to a UN Mission as a face-saving way for Iran to relinquish
                                                      her claim, an array of difficult questions remained. Who would approach the
                                                      UN and how would the approach be made? What would the Mission’s terms of
                                                      reference be? How would the Mission ascertain the wishes of the Bahraini
                                                      people? At the outset, there was little consensus between Britain, Iran and UN
                                                      Secretary-General U Thant on any of these questions, all of which would have
                                                      to be resolved before the UN Mission could proceed. The British proposed that
                                                      Iran and Britain jointly approach U Thant to ask him to lend his Good Offices
                                                      to resolving the dispute. This was unacceptable to Iran, as a joint approach

                                                      would appear, in Afshar’s words, as ‘collusion’ between Britain and Iran to fix
                                                      the UN Mission’s findings in advance. This would destroy the credibility of the
                                                      Mission’s findings in the eyes of the Iranian public. Instead, the Iranians
                                                      proposed that they bring their dispute with Britain to the UN Security Council,
                                                      which would then request U Thant to provide his Good Offices. Recourse to the
                                                      Security Council was unacceptable to the British, who feared that it would
                                                      frame the issue as a confrontation between Iran and Britain and invite
                                                      intervention by hostile members of the Council, particularly the Soviet Union.69
                                                      The Bahrainis were equally displeased with the idea of approaching the
                                                      Security Council, and instead floated the idea of referring the matter for
                                                      arbitration to a committee of four friendly regional states.70
                                                         Little progress was made at the third secret meeting between the Bahrainis
                                                      and the Iranians on 2 – 3 March 1969. The Iranians had agreed to drop their
                                                      demands for a plebiscite, but they continued to insist on an approach to the
                                                      Security Council. The Bahrainis raised the earlier British proposal for a joint

                                                      Anglo-Iranian approach to U Thant, which Afshar agreed to discuss with the
                                                      Shah.71 Once again, the Iranians proposed a compromise solution to break the
                                                      impasse. On 15 March, the Shah informed Wright that he would not press for
                                                      an initial approach to the Security Council. Nor would he accept a joint
                                                      approach to U Thant, which would create the impression that Britain and Iran
                                                      had colluded to fix the UN Mission’s findings. Instead, the Shah proposed that
                                                      Iran alone would make the initial approach to the UN Secretary-General. Once
                                                      the UN Mission had ascertained the wishes of the Bahraini people, Iran would
                                                      accept those findings if they were endorsed by the Security Council.72 This
                                                      formula would avoid the appearance of collusion while also giving the Shah’s
                                                      decision to abandon Bahrain the Security Council’s seal of approval. This
                                                      Iranian proposal would constitute the basic framework for the settlement of the
                                                      Bahrain question.
                                                         Sensing that they were close to an understanding with the British on Bahrain,
                                                      the Iranians sought to tie the resolution of the Bahrain question to their claims on
                                                      the Islands. On 19 March 1969, Asadollah Alam, the Shah’s Court Minister and
                                                      most trusted adviser, informed Wright that no agreement could be reached on
                                                      Bahrain until the issue of the Islands had been settled. The Iranians feared that if
                                                      the Bahrain issue were settled first, thus ending Iran’s opposition to an Arab
                                                      federation in the Gulf, then the Protected States would have little incentive to
                                                      negotiate with Iran over the other Islands.73 Alam records Wright’s suggestion that
                                                      ‘a solution to the problem of Bahrain will almost certainly encourage the
                                                      establishment of the Federation of Arab Emirates, at which stage Iran might well
                                                      occupy Abu Musa in the interests of joint security in the Gulf’. Wright assured
                                                      Alam that Iran could ‘depend on support from the British, should this happen’.74
                                                      However, the following evening when Alam telephoned Wright to tell him that he

                                                      had informed the Shah of their conversation, he asked Wright for his assurance
                                                      that if Iran abandoned her claim to Bahrain, Britain would acquiesce to Iran’s
                                                      seizure of the Islands. Wright responded that he saw ‘no such possibility’.75
                                                      As Alam records, the Shah was clearly ‘disappointed’ by the British response, as
                                                      he was sure that he had ‘bagged’ the Islands after his New Delhi statement.76
                                                         While some have speculated that such a ‘package deal’ was reached between
                                                      Britain and Iran, there is little evidence to support this claim.77 Afshar, the
                                                      principal Iranian negotiator in the Bahrain talks, categorically denied that any such
                                                      deal was struck.78 In April 1968 and again in March 1969 the British did raise
                                                      Iranian expectations that a concession on Bahrain would engender British
                                                      goodwill towards Iran when it came to settling the Islands dispute. However, when
                                                      the Iranians sought explicit confirmation of such a quid pro quo, they were met
                                                      with a negative British response. The matter was put to rest on 27 May 1969 when
                                                      Michael Stewart was received by the Shah in Tehran. The Shah again asked the
                                                      Foreign Secretary for his assurance that once the Bahrain issue was solved Britain

                                                      would acquiesce to Iran’s seizure of the Islands. Stewart’s response was that ‘no
                                                      British government would be able to give such an assurance’. Nonetheless, the
                                                      Shah seemed satisfied with Stuart’s pledge that Britain would use her considerable
                                                      influence over the Protected States to urge them to reach an understanding with
                                                      Iran on the Islands.79
                                                         From April to September 1969 the discussions focused on how the Bahrain
                                                      question would be brought to the attention of the United Nations, the terms of
                                                      reference of the proposed UN Mission, the method by which the Mission would
                                                      ascertain the wishes of the Bahraini people, and finally how its findings would be
                                                      transmitted to and accepted by Iran. The Mission was clearly a pre-arranged public
                                                      relations exercise, designed as a face-saving way for the Shah to relinquish Iran’s
                                                      claim to Bahrain. Although every detail of the Mission would be prearranged, the
                                                      Shah hoped to avoid any appearance of Anglo-Iranian collusion in order to
                                                      preserve the credibility of the Mission’s findings in the eyes of the Iranian public.
                                                      This would be difficult to achieve, as both the British and the Bahrainis insisted
                                                      that every step of the process be scripted and tightly controlled to ensure that the
                                                      exercise did not ignite sectarian tensions in Bahrain.
                                                         The negotiations stalled in the summer of 1969 when the British and the
                                                      Iranians could not agree on the method by which the UN Mission would ascertain
                                                      the wishes of the Bahraini people. The British, reflecting Bahraini anxieties,
                                                      wanted prior agreement on the Mission’s methodology. They envisaged that the
                                                      PRSG would go to Bahrain to speak with a designated list of community leaders
                                                      and civil society groups and then report back to the Security Council. The Iranians
                                                      wanted to leave the decision on methodology to the PRSG himself. As Afshar
                                                      explained to Wright on 19 July, Iran could not a priori give up the idea of a

                                                      plebiscite in Bahrain. However, Iran was willing to acquiesce to canvassing
                                                      instead of a plebiscite if this was the choice of the PRSG. In this way,
                                                      responsibility for abandoning the idea of a plebiscite would be shifted from the
                                                      Shah to the United Nations, thereby avoiding any hint of collusion between Britain
                                                      and Iran to fix the Mission’s findings.80 This question of methodology threatened
                                                      to halt the negotiations entirely. The Shah was not insisting on a plebiscite, but for
                                                      the sake of appearances he wanted the PRSG to take responsibility for ruling it out.
                                                      The Shah wanted the UN Mission to appear to have acted independently and
                                                      legally so that the Iranian public would accept its findings, after which he could
                                                      graciously acquiesce to the genuine wishes of the Bahraini people. As Alam
                                                      explained to Wright in August, any appearance of collusion would leave the Shah
                                                      and his dynasty open to accusations that they had betrayed Iran. For the Shah to
                                                      agree in advance to the method of procedure was tantamount, in Alam’s words, to
                                                      ‘suicide, perhaps even treason’.81
                                                         The Shah was eager to quickly resolve the Bahrain question and he once again

                                                      compromised in order to break the deadlock on the methodology question. On 2
                                                      September 1969 he proposed to Wright that ‘provided he was kept in ignorance’,
                                                      the British and the Bahrainis could select any procedure they liked for the UN
                                                      Mission and could prepare the list of individuals and organizations that the PRSG
                                                      would consult in Bahrain. The British and the Bahrainis were free to make an
                                                      agreement with the United Nations about this procedure, but Iran should have no
                                                      official knowledge of it.82 As long as the British, Bahrainis and the United Nations
                                                      kept Iran in the dark, the Shah could deny any knowledge of collusion to script the
                                                      UN Mission’s findings. The British had kept UN Under-Secretary-General Ralph
                                                      Bunche informed of their discussions with the Iranians since December 1968.83
                                                      Bunche had made it clear to the British that U Thant would prefer both the British
                                                      and the Iranians to sign off on the methodology of the proposed UN Mission.84 In a
                                                      meeting in New York on 19 October 1969, the Shah informed U Thant that he was
                                                      happy for the United Nations to work out the details of the methodology with the
                                                      British.85 Nonetheless, U Thant was unwilling to go along with the Iranian desire
                                                      for official ignorance. His fear was that when the UN Mission found that the
                                                      Bahrainis sought independence, the Shah might cave-in to domestic pressure and
                                                      reject the Mission’s findings on the grounds that Iran had not been consulted. He
                                                      insisted that before Iran formally approached him, Britain and Iran should make a
                                                      joint informal approach to him and sign a memorandum for his own files
                                                      acknowledging agreement on the proposed Mission’s terms of reference and
                                                      methodology.86
                                                         The Secretary-General’s demands were unpalatable to the Iranians. By signing
                                                      off on the method of procedure, Iran would be complicit in fixing the UN
                                                      Mission’s findings in advance. Afshar warned the British on 23 December 1969
                                                      that:

                                                           If U Thant communicated the method of operation to the Iranian Government in any form,
                                                           written or oral, formal or informal and even if someone just whispered in Vakil’s [Iranian
                                                           Ambassador to the UN] ear, the Iranians would say that they were opposed to this method
                                                           of operation.87
                                                      With this caveat, the joint informal approach to U Thant took place at his official
                                                      residence in New York on 28 December 1969. Iran’s Ambassador, Mehdi Vakil,
                                                      asked the Secretary-General whether he would be willing to exercise his Good
                                                      Offices to ascertain the wishes of the Bahraini people, on the basis of the terms of
                                                      reference agreed to by Britain and Iran. Vakil stated that Iran would leave it to U
                                                      Thant to determine ‘the most appropriate method’ for ascertaining the Bahraini
                                                      people’s wishes and he emphasized that his government did not wish to receive
                                                      any communication from the Secretary-General on the method of procedure. U
                                                      Thant agreed to provide his Good Offices, on the condition that there was
                                                      agreement between Britain and Iran on the terms of reference and methodology for
                                                      the proposed UN Mission. He did not ask the Iranians to sign a memorandum on

                                                      the methodology, but insisted on sending a vaguely worded summary of it to the
                                                      Iranians prior to their formal approach. The Iranian diplomats, realizing this was
                                                      a sine qua non for the Secretary-General, acquiesced.88 Indeed, the next day
                                                      a memorandum on the methodology of the UN Mission was delivered to Iran’s
                                                      Mission to the United Nations in New York without any response from the
                                                      Iranians.89
                                                         At the final hurdle, with the joint informal approach having been made, the
                                                      negotiations focused on the wording of the letter the Iranians would send to U
                                                      Thant, formally requesting the UN Secretary-General to lend his Good Offices.
                                                      Again, it was of paramount importance to the Iranians that the letter be devoid of
                                                      any hint of collusion with the British. A draft had been presented to the British on
                                                      29 January 1970, in which Iran requested U Thant to ascertain the ‘true wishes’ of
                                                      the ‘inhabitants’ of Bahrain with respect to their ‘future status’.90 The use of ‘true
                                                      wishes’ implied that it was not certain whether the Bahrainis wished to be
                                                      independent of Iran, as assumed by Britain and the al-Khalifah. The choice of
                                                      ‘inhabitants,’ rather than ‘people’, implied that the population of Bahrain did not
                                                      necessarily constitute an Arab nation separate from Iran. Furthermore, by
                                                      employing ‘future status’ the Iranians sought to distinguish the current status of
                                                      Bahrain as a province of Iran from Bahrain’s potential future status as an
                                                      independent state.
                                                         Wright travelled to St Moritz to settle the wording of the formal Iranian
                                                      approach with the Shah, who was then on his annual skiing vacation in
                                                      Switzerland. He met with Afshar and the Shah on 5 February 1970, and after some
                                                      hard bargaining begrudgingly agreed to the ‘future status’ and ‘true wishes’
                                                      wording, but refused to accept ‘inhabitants’. The Shah agreed in principle, and left
                                                      it to Afshar and Wright to finalize the text. After two hours of back and forth
                                                      between Wright and Afshar, the final text was agreed and approved by the Shah.91
                                                      However, Iran’s formal approach to U Thant was delayed until March, so that the
                                                      Bahrainis could make preparations for receiving the UN Mission. On 9 March

                                                      1970, Vakil delivered the formal Iranian approach to U Thant, asking him to use
                                                      his Good Offices ‘with a view to ascertaining the true wishes of the people of
                                                      Bahrain with respect to the future status of the Islands of Bahrain by appointing a
                                                      Personal Representative to carry out this Mission’. After a short interval designed
                                                      to avoid any appearance of collusion, the British informed U Thant that the Iranian
                                                      proposal was ‘acceptable’.92
                                                         With the negotiations completed, it remained for the United Nations to carry out
                                                      its Mission in Bahrain and for Iran to recognize Bahrain’s independence. In
                                                      August 1969 the Iranians had proposed Vittorio Winspeare Guicciardi, an Italian
                                                      diplomat who was then Director-General of the UN Office at Geneva, as a possible
                                                      PRSG for the UN Mission to Bahrain.93 After speaking with Winspeare in
                                                      November 1969, the British concluded that ‘we can be reasonably confident that
                                                      he will act in accordance with whatever is agreed’ between Britain, Bahrain and
                                                      the UN.94 Winspeare was chosen by U Thant to be his PRSG, and together with

                                                      by whatever method they had agreed to with the British for ascertaining the wishes
                                                      of the Bahraini people.95 With the British, Bahrainis and the United Nations all in
                                                      agreement, and with the Bahrainis having prepared their population for the UN
                                                      Mission’s arrival, the findings of the UN Mission were a foregone conclusion.
                                                         While the Bahrainis were preparing their public for the UN Mission’s arrival,
                                                      the Shah also took steps to prepare Iranian public opinion for the abandonment of
                                                      Iran’s claim to Bahrain. Pamphlets were distributed within the armed forces, the
                                                      civil service and the universities explaining why the claim was unsustainable.96
                                                      The only opposition from within the Shah’s inner circle came from Zahedi, who
                                                      consulted widely with Iran’s political and military elite to see whether any military
                                                      option was feasible for holding on to Bahrain.97 He took the bold step of taking a
                                                      number of senior officials from the Foreign Ministry to discuss Iran’s claim to
                                                      Bahrain with the Shah on 14 January 1970, perhaps in a last-ditch effort to change
                                                      his Sovereign’s mind. During this audience the Shah explained to his diplomats
                                                      that Bahrain was of little value to Iran and giving up the claim would help foster
                                                      the necessary conditions for Iran to assume a leadership role in the Gulf.
                                                      Moreover, he explained that he had no intention of becoming a ‘Don Quixote’ by
                                                      using the military to enforce Iranian sovereignty over Bahrain.98 Indeed, even
                                                      Zahedi finally concluded that any use of force would only result in Iran’s regional
                                                      isolation.99
                                                         U Thant was set to announce the UN Mission on 28 March 1970, and the Iranian
                                                      Government planned to convene an emergency session of the Majlis the next day

                                                      to inform the nation that if the Winspeare Mission found that the people of Bahrain
                                                      sought independence, and the UN Security Council endorsed these findings, then
                                                      Iran would renounce her claim. To pre-empt any opposition in the Majlis, Premier
                                                      Hoveyda held a meeting on 26 March 1970 with the leaders of the parliamentary
                                                      factions at the home of Mohsen Pezechgpour, leader of the small far-right Pan-
                                                      Iranist Party. Although the Pan-Iranists controlled only a handful of seats in the
                                                      Majlis, they were staunch advocates of the Iranian claim to Bahrain. Abbas Ali
                                                      Khalatbari, who had replaced Afshar as Permanent Secretary of the Foreign
                                                      Ministry, accompanied Hoveyda. Khalatbari explained to the assembled
                                                      parliamentary leaders that Bahrain was of little economic or strategic value to
                                                      Iran and that enforcing Iran’s claim would mean an unpalatable and costly military
                                                      intervention. Hoveyda turned to Pezechgpour and informed him that if the Pan-
                                                      Iranists cooperated they would be rewarded with more than 30 seats in the next
                                                      Majlis. If they did not, there would be severe consequences.100
                                                         According to Alam, neither Hoveyda nor Zahedi wanted to accept the odious

                                                      task of informing the Majlis that Iran intended to abandon her claim to Bahrain.101
                                                      In an act of cruel irony the Shah finally ordered Zahedi, the staunchest defender of
                                                      Iran’s claim, to deliver the news to the Majlis on 29 March 1970. Despite
                                                      Hoveyda’s efforts, Pezechgpour denounced the Shah’s decision from the Majlis
                                                      floor.102 The Shah was reportedly furious with Pezechgpour and the Pan-Iranists.
                                                      Their offices in Khuzistan province were closed and their party newspaper was
                                                      shut down, its publishers jailed.103 However, besides the Pan-Iranists’ protests in
                                                      the Majlis, there is no evidence of any public outcry against the Shah’s decision.
                                                      The heavily censored print media presented the decision as an Iranian victory over
                                                      British imperialism.104
                                                         After this minor disturbance, the rest of the scripted exercise unfolded without
                                                      incident. Winspeare arrived in Bahrain on 30 March 1970 and finished his
                                                      consultations by 13 April.105 His report found that ‘the overwhelming majority of
                                                      the people of Bahrain wish to gain recognition of their identity in a fully
                                                      independent and sovereign State free to decide for itself its relations with other
                                                      States’.106 According to Wright, the report was greeted by the Iranians with ‘smug
                                                      self-congratulation’.107 Both Iran and Britain immediately requested that the UN
                                                      Security Council convene to consider Winspeare’s findings. It was imperative for
                                                      the Shah that Winspeare’s report should receive the Security Council’s stamp of
                                                      international approval. The Council convened on 11 May 1970 and unanimously
                                                      adopted Resolution 278, which endorsed Winspeare’s report and welcomed its
                                                      findings.108

                                                         The wishes of the Bahraini people had now been ascertained and recognized
                                                      by the United Nations. All that was left was for Iran’s legislature to ratify the
                                                      decision. The Majlis was promptly convened on 14 May and passed a motion
                                                      identical to Resolution 278 by a vote of 187 to 4, with only the Pan-Iranists voting
                                                      against the motion.109 Four days later the Iranian Senate convened, where all 60
                                                      senators voted in favour of the same motion.110 The Iranian claim to Bahrain had
                                                      been abandoned with little public or private protest. Aside from the objections
                                                      voiced by Pan-Iranists, there were murmurings of discontent among staff officers
                                                      in the Imperial Iranian Navy. For example, Admiral Kamal Habibollahi privately
                                                      expressed doubts about the validity of the UN Mission’s findings and was of the
                                                      opinion that giving away Bahrain was a major strategic mistake because it meant
                                                      surrendering control of the southern portion of the Gulf. The Shah was certainly
                                                      aware of this disquiet and he went in person to the Iranian Admiralty to explain to
                                                      his naval commanders why maintaining the claim to Bahrain was no longer in
                                                      Iran’s interests.111

                                                         The abandonment of Iran’s claim to Bahrain contributed to a dramatic
                                                      improvement in Egyptian– Iranian relations. The decline of Nasser’s power
                                                      following Israel’s decisive victory over Egypt in the June 1967 War, along with
                                                      Iran and Egypt’s shared animosity towards the Ba’thist regime that had come to
                                                      power in Iraq in July 1968, had led to an easing of tensions between the Shah and
                                                      Nasser. Through the mediation efforts of various Arab leaders, Iran and Egypt
                                                      began discussions in May 1970 for a resumption of diplomatic relations, which
                                                      had been severed by Nasser a decade earlier. The Shah’s decision to abandon
                                                      Bahrain was undoubtedly responsible for the timing of the resumption of
                                                      diplomatic relations between Tehran and Cairo on 29 August 1970. Furthermore,
                                                      Iran’s relations with the Gulf sheikhdoms also improved, leading to continental
                                                      shelf agreements with Kuwait in July 1970 and with Bahrain in June 1971.112
                                                         This Arab– Iranian rapprochement strengthened Iran’s position when the time
                                                      came to settle the Islands dispute. Following months of negotiations with the
                                                      British and the Rulers of Sharjah and Ras Al-Khaimah, the Shah deployed his
                                                      troops on the Islands on 30 November 1971, one day before Britain’s treaty
                                                      obligations to the Rulers expired. Iran had reached an agreement with the Ruler of
                                                      Sharjah on Abu Musa, and according to Admiral Ramzi Abbas-Attaie, who
                                                      oversaw the deployment of Iranian troops on Abu Musa, a representative of the
                                                      Ruler of Sharjah accompanied the Iranian forces when they landed.113 No such
                                                      agreement was reached with Ras Al-Khaimah on the Tunbs, and when the Iranian
                                                      troops landed on those islands they were met with minor resistance resulting in

                                                      World’s reaction to Iran’s military deployment on the Islands was greatly muted.
                                                      Only Iraq severed diplomatic relations with Iran, and through the Arab League,
                                                      tried to persuade the other Arab states to do likewise. Iraq, along with Libya,
                                                      Algeria and South Yemen, lodged a protest with the UN Security Council.
                                                      However, when the Council met on 10 December 1971 to consider the dispute, it
                                                      took no action against Iran and instead opted to postpone the matter. Egypt limited
                                                      itself to calling on Iran to withdraw and reach a ‘peaceful and just solution’.115
                                                         Soon after concluding the Bahrain negotiations on 5 February 1970 in St

                                                      advisor Asadollah Alam. On the way to the ski slopes the two childhood friends
                                                      chatted about the negotiations that had just been concluded. The Shah candidly
                                                      asked Alam: ‘Between ourselves, do you suppose that we are acting as traitors to

                                                      abandon Iran’s claim, the Shah still feared the judgement of Iranian public
                                                      opinion. He had long ago concluded that Bahrain was of little strategic value to
                                                      Iran. In 1968 when the British announced that they would leave the Gulf in three
                                                      years time, the Iranian claim became an obstacle to the Shah’s efforts to foster
                                                      Arab– Iranian cooperation on regional security. His decision to abandon Bahrain
                                                      was driven by a strategic calculation that Arab– Iranian cooperation would both
                                                      prevent the penetration of the Gulf by radical Arab forces and also create the
                                                      necessary conditions for Iran to assume a leadership role in the region.
                                                      Nonetheless, what the record of these secret Anglo-Iranian negotiations suggests is
                                                      that the Shah’s abiding fear of the judgement of Iranian public opinion constrained
                                                      his ability to conduct foreign policy.

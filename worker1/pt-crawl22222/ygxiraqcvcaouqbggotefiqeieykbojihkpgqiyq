The <em>highest court(s)</em> subfield includes the name(s) of a country&#x27;s highest level court(s), the number and titles of the judges, and the types of cases heard by the court, which commonly are based on civil, criminal, administrative, and constitutional law. A number of countries have separate constitutional courts. The <em>judge selection and term of office</em> subfield includes the organizations and associated officials responsible for nominating and appointing judges, and a brief description of the process. The selection process can be indicative of the independence of a country&#x27;s court system from other branches of its government. Also included in this subfield are judges&#x27; tenures, which can range from a few years, to a specified retirement age, to lifelong appointments. The <em>subordinate courts</em> subfield lists the courts lower in the hierarchy of a country&#x27;s court system. A few countries with federal-style governments, such as Brazil, Canada, and the US, in addition to their federal court, have separate state- or province-level court systems, though generally the two systems interact.</p><div class="pb30"><h3 class="mt10"><a href="/the-world-factbook/countries/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a></h3><strong>highest court(s):</strong> the Taliban are purported to have appointed clerics, including a &quot;Chief Justice&quot;, to Afghanistan&#x27;s Supreme Court<br/><br/><strong>subordinate courts:</strong> provincial courts, religious courts, and specialty courts</div><div class="pb30"><h3 class="mt10"><a href="/the-world-factbook/countries/akrotiri-and-dhekelia/">Akrotiri and Dhekelia</a></h3><strong>highest court(s):</strong> Senior Judges&#x27;

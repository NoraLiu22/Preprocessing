<b>The reason why some women have problems reaching orgasm might be down to their genes, say UK scientists. </b>
<p>
By studying 4,000 twins, Keele and London researchers found female orgasm is not all psycho-social as some claim.
<p>
This variability might even be beneficial and have evolved to help women find the best male to mate with, they told a Royal Society journal. 
<p>
Knowing which genes are important could potentially pave the way to drugs to help women orgasm.

<p>
The findings also suggest that women who orgasm easily may be satisfied with mates who are less skilled in bed. 
<p>
Professor Tim Spector and colleagues carried out DNA tests on more than 4,000 women aged 19-83, half of whom were identical and half of whom were non-identical twins. 
<p>
Identical twins share the same DNA, while non-identical twins do not. 
<p>
The women were also asked to fill out confidential questionnaires about their sexual lives. 
<p>
<b>Orgasm failure</b>
<p>
A third of the women said they never or seldom achieved orgasm, while more than a tenth said they always had an orgasm during intercourse. 
<p>
More of the women were able to orgasm during masturbation, with 34% always reaching orgasm.
<p>
In comparison, studies have shown that men fail to orgasm only 2% of the time during intercourse. 
<p>

<p>
Overall, orgasm frequency was higher for the identical female twins than the non-identical female twins, which the researchers said suggested there must be some genetic component. 
<p>
Professor Spector, director of the Twin Research Unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London, said: "We found that between 34 and 45% of the variation in ability to orgasm can be explained by underlying genetic variation.
<p>
"There is a biological underlying influence that can't be attributed purely to upbringing, religion or race.
<p>
"The fact that it's heritable suggests that evolution has a role."
<p>
One theory is that the orgasm promotes fertility. Past research shows women are slightly more likely to orgasm during periods of fertility and that sperm uptake is increased during orgasm. 
<p>
"The other theory is that orgasm is a male-selection tool," said Professor Spector.
<p>
<b>'Many factors involved'</b>
<p>
"If a man is considered powerful enough, strong enough, or thoughtful enough in bed or in the cave, then he's likely to hang around as a long-term partner and be a better bet for bringing up children."
<p>
Professor Spector said pinpointing the genes involved would take years because there could be hundreds.
<p>
It is possible that their influence is physical, causing variations in the G-spot, or psychological, altering arousal, he said.
<p>
Dr Margaret Rees, consultant gynaecologist at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and expert in female sexual dysfunction, said: "This is interesting but quite simplistic. 
<p>
"There are many factors involved with female sexual dysfunction - hypoactive desire, low arousal, problems with orgasm and pain. 
<p>
"Any one of these can cause the others. They are all inter-related."
<p>
Therefore, she said it was unlikely that a single drug treatment would work.
<p>
However, she said self-help and psychosexual counselling could be helpful. 
<p>
The study appears in the June issue of Biology Letters.<!-- E BO -->

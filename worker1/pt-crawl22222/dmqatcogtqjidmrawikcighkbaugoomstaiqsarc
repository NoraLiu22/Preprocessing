  <h1>
    Islamic Law
  </h1>
  
  
    
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">Two terms are used to refer to law in Islam: shariah and
   fiqh. Shariah refers to God's divine law as
   contained in the <i>Quran</i> and the sayings and doings of 
   Muhammad
    (hadith). Fiqh refers to the scholarly efforts of jurists
   (fuqaha) to elaborate the details of shariah through investigation and debate.
   Muslims understand shariah to be an unchanging revelation, while fiqh, as a
   human endeavor, is open to debate, reinterpretation, and change.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">Scholars
   and jurists developed the law by combining knowledge of the <i>Quran</i>,
   hadith, and analogical reasoning with local practice. Beginning in the
   mid-eighth century, the major Sunni schools of legal thought
   (madhhabs)—Hanafi, Maliki, Shafii, and Hanbali—and the
   Twelver Shii Jafari madhhab emerged. Other minor and short-lived
   schools also developed.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">Sunnis and Shiis differed in their understanding
   of who held the power to interpret shariah. For Sunnis, the scholars had this
   right, as delegated by the actual ruler. Shiis initially believed that only an
   imam (in this case, a descendant of Muhammad) could interpret shariah because
   the imam, like Muhammad, was believed to be infallible. When the line of
   appropriate descendants ended, this tradition was reinterpreted to grant
   judicial authority to the fuqaha as the imam's representatives. In
   addition to the <i>Quran</i> and hadith of Muhammad, Shiis also use the
   rulings of the imams. Ijma, or consensus, is admitted only if it includes the
   infallible imam's opinion.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">There are two types of fiqh
   literature: that dealing with usul al-fiqh (roots) and that dealing
   with furu al-fiqh (branches). Usul al-fiqh explores the
   four sources of the law—the <i>Quran</i>, hadith, consensus
   (ijma), and analogical reasoning (qiyas)—to provide structures for
   interpreting revelation. The <i>Quran</i> and hadith are considered to be
   equal in authority, although the <i>Quran</i>, as God's word,
   is superior in its nature and origins. Other issues include the principles of
   abrogation (naskh); the application, ramifications, and limitations of
   analogical argument; and the value and limits of consensus. This whole set of
   interpretative structures is brought together in the idea of ijtihad, or
   independent reasoning, which both recognizes and encourages a variety of
   interpretations on all but the fundamental structures of the law. Only those
   with sufficient educational background in the sources of the law are qualified
   to practice ijtihad.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">Education in fiqh was a critical part of Islamic
   education from the tenth century forward. It provided training in systematic
   thought and controlled argument, serving the needs of the merchant classes and
   governing bureaucracies. In the modern period, exclusive training in the
   traditional Islamic sciences has become less relevant as legal education has
   been reconstituted along European lines and the jurisdiction of religious courts
   has been restricted or eliminated.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">Furu literature, both legal manuals and
   collections of cases, discusses rules for rituals (ibadat) and social relations
   (muamalat). Ritual topics include purity, prayers, alms (zakah), pilgrimage,
   fasting, and jihad. Social relations topics include marriage, divorce,
   inheritance, buying, selling, lending, hiring, gifts, testamentary bequests,
   agency, deposit, crimes, torts, penalties, compensations for injury, judicial
   practice and procedure, rules relating to slaves, land ownership, land holding,
   contractual partnerships, slaughter of animals for food, and oaths and their
   effects. There are five categories of actions in furu literature: mandatory,
   recommended, permitted, abhorred, and prohibited.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">Historically, there were
   two types of court systems: the qadi (judge) court, responsible for family law
   (marriage, divorce, inheritance, testamentary bequests), administration of
   charitable endowments (waqf) and the property of orphans, and overseeing
   contracts and civil disputes, and the mazalim, a supplemental court system that
   administered criminal law and investigated complaints against government
   officials. Interpretation of fiqh was carried out on an informal level by muftis
   who produced fatwas (responses to legal questions). A mufti's rulings
   could be given to individuals, qadis, and/or agents of government,
   and could either legitimize policies or restrict their practical effect. Muftis
   typically remained outside the official government bureaucracy.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">In the
   nineteenth and twentieth centuries, impetus for reform has come both from within
   the Islamic tradition itself, as specialists in Islamic law have sought to
   incorporate changing attitudes and social needs into law, and from without, as
   political leaders have imposed modernization programs. Many Sunni Muslim
   administrators and reformers felt that Islamic law ought to be practical and
   resemble Western codes. Some reformers advocated disregarding school traditions
   and reinterpreting ijtihad to create modern Muslim administrative and
   institutional forms. Most twentieth-century Islamic legal reform
   efforts have focused on personal status matters.

        Germany, mass protests against meetings of the international elite date 
        back to 1985, when the G7 was held in Bonn, West Germany&#8217;s capital. 
        The forms of protest used there were remarkably similar to those used 
        15 years later: the radical left organised &#8216;action days&#8217;, 
        there was a counter-conference, and a big demonstration with 30,000 participants, 
        with smaller events in other cities.<br>
        For the autonomists, however, the campaign against the International Monetary 
        Fund (IMF) and World Bank Meeting in West Berlin in September 1988 was 
        to have far greater meaning.<br>
        The mobilisation lasted three years and attempted to combine mass militancy 
        with clandestine actions, to formulate and express radical analyses, to 
        bring different tendencies within the radical left together, to interact 
        with the broader left and to publicly oppose all that the Conference stood 
        for.<br>
        Here&#8217;s what happened&#8230;<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><strong>How 
        it All Began</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">+++1985: The IMF and 
        the World Bank decide to hold their 1988 autumn Meeting in West Berlin. 
        The city government and the media are ecstatic: tens of thousands of Summit 
        visitors and journalists will come to the city. A tourism boom is expected. 
        The city hopes to be put back in the spotlight as an international metropolis.+++<br>
        The autonomists&#8217; attitude was somewhat different. With more than 
        10,000 Conference visitors and journalists scattered across the city in 
        hundreds of hotels, driven through countless streets to the Conference 
        Centre and the official events, there were so many targets! We knew that 
        the powerful would not be able to keep the &#8216;security problem&#8217; 
        under control. The more effort they made in advance, the more politically 
        embarrassed they would be afterwards. And at the same time, the more they 
        downplayed the threat we represented, the greater the danger that they 
        would lose control of the Conference.<br>
        A few days after the Summit was announced, groups in West Berlin began 
        to voice their opposition. The Berlin Alternative List (a part of the 
        then-radical Green Party), peace activists and left wing union branches 
        criticised the politics of the IMF and planned an official counter-programme. 
        Two small groups from the autonomous scene in Berlin were also quick to 
        respond; one was active against the G7 Meeting in Bonn and wanted to combine 
        theory (including being openly critical of the traditional left) with 
        practice, whilst the other hoped to strengthen the radical left by building 
        a well thought out, long-term campaign.<br>
        The majority of autonomists who knew about the mobilisation continued 
        at this stage to focus on the day-to-day projects they were involved in, 
        and found it somewhat strange to begin organising three years in advance 
        of an event.<br>
        Eventually, as people from the most diverse tendencies within the radical 
        left sat together at the same table, the autonomous campaign against the 
        Conference began to develop a character. Differences in priorities emerged 
        as soon as the direction and purpose of the campaign began to be discussed. 
        One group wanted to physically prevent the Conference from taking place, 
        by building effective resistance throughout the mobilisation. The second 
        regarded this as &#8216;illusionary action-ism&#8217; and placed more 
        importance upon the development of theoretical discussions. [Note: three 
        of the authors of this article were part of the &#8216;activist tendency&#8217;; 
        as a result this aspect is given far more weight here].<br>
        A second point of conflict was the possibility of working with &#8216;reformists&#8217;. 
        Whilst the &#8216;activist&#8217; tendency prioritised organising effectively 
        amongst the autonomists, they also sought dialogue with the broader opposition 
        to the Summit. The &#8216;theoretical&#8217; tendency, however, condemned 
        this as ideologically dubious coalition-building.<br>
        The differences were clear at the National Conference of Development-Politics 
        Action Groups (BUKO). It brought together very different groups (fair 
        trade groups, faith-based solidarity groups and more practical campaign 
        groups) and had become more radical over the preceding years. The days 
        of action against the IMF and World Bank were among the items on the agenda. 
        Representatives of the Alternative List/Green Party were heavily involved 
        and pushed their agenda: campaigning for debt relief for the poorest nations 
        and reform of the IMF through increased involvement of poor countries, 
        and organising a big, peaceful rally and counter-conference to the Summit.<br>
        BUKO brought to light a major point of conflict among the Berlin autonomists: 
        should they use the conference to put forth their position - that the 
        IMF and World Bank can&#8217;t be reformed, and should be attacked, because 
        it&#8217;s not about peaceful protest, but actively disrupting the capitalist 
        spectacle? Or would attendance at the conference just amount to an attempt 
        at currying favour with the reformists?<br>
        In the end a small group of autonomists took on communication with the 
        BUKO people, who confirmed that they were preparing to mobilise in West 
        Berlin and would call for people to take part in the autonomists&#8217; 
        actions. The autonomists were also invited to take part in their mobilising 
        conference. The issue of coalition-building with BUKO always remained 
        a point of contention amongst the autonomists.<br>
        The shape of the mobilisation eventually emerged from discussions about 
        objectives, content and forms of action. The decision was summarised by 
        the slogan, &#8220;We will disrupt this Conference!&#8221; and was signed, 
        &#8220;Autonomous Groups of West Berlin&#8221;. The slogan was adopted 
        by all the autonomous groups and used from this point on.<img src="/web/20110511121605im_/http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/images/small_20images/car-fire.jpg" width="521" height="287" align="left"><br>
        In March 1987, the newsletter, Unzertrennlich #4 announced, &#8220;In 
        September they&#8217;re all coming here - the financial bosses of the 
        capitalist core from Tokyo to Frankfurt to New York&#8230; executives 
        from the headquarters of multinationals such as Toyota, Lockheed-Martin, 
        and Siemens along with ministers, Secretaries of State, &#8216;experts&#8217;, 
        journalists and their observers. More than 14,000 of them will be here 
        for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Conference. For a few 
        days, Berlin will be recognised in the eyes of the world as a symbol of 
        capitalist imperialism. All hotels will be fully booked; streets and entire 
        sections of the city will be blocked off. Berlin will be rebuilt in the 
        name of &#8216;security&#8217;. The message is clear: those responsible 
        for hunger, profit, terror and war throughout the entire world are coming 
        to this &#8216;capital of the free world&#8217;. To this, we object. Our 
        suggestion: Disrupt the Conference!&#8221;<br>
        The spectrum of those involved was becoming broader and broader. Activists 
        from numerous women and lesbian groups - who had until then viewed anti-capitalist 
        politics as conflicting with campaigns against patriarchy - joined in. 
        [Translator&#8217;s note: There is a tradition of women&#8217;s groups 
        within the German radical left describing themselves as &#8216;women and 
        lesbian&#8217; in response to the fact that many lesbians felt marginalised 
        and not visible enough within women&#8217;s organisations]. The anti-IMF 
        group at the Latin America Centre (LAZ) also became very active, and a 
        regular co-ordination meeting was organised. An important objective had 
        been achieved: Despite all the differences, a core of autonomist groups 
        was now actively involved in the campaign.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><strong>Preparation</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8216;The other side&#8217; 
        offered an important contribution: Hans Klein, the CSU (Conservative) 
        National Development Minister, warned that BUKO were preparing a campaign 
        to disrupt the Summit and were &#8220;announcing violence, even if in 
        a restricted way. The recently freed potential from the struggles at the 
        fiercely defended Hafenstrasse squat, Runway West [a camp squatting land 
        to prevent a runway being built at Frankfurt Airport] and the nuclear 
        processing plant Wackersdorf [the target of a series of big, very militant, 
        demonstrations] is being exposed to a new terrain of action.&#8221;<br>
        This was extremely encouraging. From that point on, on top of regular 
        co-ordinating meetings, private discussions were being held around the 
        kitchen tables of communal houses. The campaign slowly began to establish 
        itself, and not just in West Berlin&#8230;<br>
        Anti-IMF/World Bank groups were formed in cities across Germany, attempting 
        to build links with local projects, groups and structures. This was not 
        a smooth process. When all these groups met for the first time quarrels 
        developed between &#8216;newcomers&#8217; and &#8216;old-timers&#8217;, 
        and between Berlin groups and those from West Germany. These were added 
        to the existing divisions between &#8216;theoretical&#8217; and &#8216;activist&#8217;, 
        and between &#8216;anti-capitalist&#8217; and &#8216;anti-patriarchal&#8217;, 
        tendencies within the movement. Despite this, the campaign continued to 
        develop, with a fair bit of interest being expressed at the Libertarian 
        Days Conference in Frankfurt in April 1987. The IMF/World Bank Conference, 
        however, was still just one issue amongst many.<br>
        In West Berlin, in the early summer of 1987, two events demonstrated the 
        movement&#8217;s strength and made a large mobilisation against the Summit 
        by the autonomous left seem much more likely - the May Day uprising, and 
        Reagan&#8217;s June visit.<br>
        The May Day uprising created an atmosphere of rebellion, as well as a 
        police response: an &#8216;anti-thug unit&#8217; was established and armoured 
        cars were deployed on the streets. When Reagan visited, the police laid 
        siege to Kreuzberg - the heart of West Berlin&#8217;s squatting district 
        and radical left scene - creating an unprecedented level of solidarity 
        from the rest of Kreuzberg&#8217;s (mostly working class) residents towards 
        the autonomists. A few weeks earlier the anti-nuclear movement - in which 
        a lot of autonomists were involved - successfully held a large illegal 
        demonstration against Siemens, KWU and the Deutsche Bank on Berlin&#8217;s 
        Ku&#8217;damm - the city&#8217;s major high-end shopping street.<br>
        The attendance of Berlin autonomists at the BUKO conference in Fulda in 
        May 1987 was, by this point, no longer causing conflicts within the radical 
        left. Some still thought it unnecessary, but were no longer worried about 
        false alliances being built - the differences between the autonomists 
        and &#8216;the reformists&#8217; had become clear enough.<br>
        Within BUKO there were two equally strong factions. One believed that 
        the organisation should adopt a reformist position, so as not to endanger 
        funding from churches and other institutions, and the other thought it 
        necessary to follow up their criticisms of the World Bank with action 
        on the streets. BUKO finally decided to support not only the big demonstration 
        and counter-conference, but also the autonomist days of action.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><strong>The 
        Campaign Takes Shape</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main goals of 
        the mobilisation became clear soon after the BUKO meeting. The heads of 
        the large NGOs [Non-Governmental Organisations] and church organisations 
        were planning a big, peaceful, demonstration before the Conference started, 
        and organising a counter-conference. The grassroots activists from these 
        organisations were planning their own protests during the Conference, 
        parallel to the autonomists&#8217; days of action. The autonomists also 
        were planning a large, militant demonstration to mark the end of the Summit.<br>
        The bottom line of the autonomists&#8217; position was finally clear: 
        there would be no official linking up with reformist organisations, but 
        co-ordination would be possible with everyone interested in taking action 
        during the Conference. A framework for the days of action was drafted 
        by a small co-ordination group within which there were no party or organisation 
        leaders, just autonomists and grassroots activists - and a few who refused 
        to be classified as either &#8216;autonomist&#8217; or &#8216;reformist&#8217;.<br>
        One sign of &#8216;unity&#8217; within the campaign appeared when the 
        Rote Zora, a women&#8217;s guerrilla group, carried out arson attacks 
        at the HQ of Adler and eight of its other buildings. Adler were targeted 
        as an act of solidarity with striking workers in their South Korean factories. 
        The communiqu&eacute; referred directly to the IMF/World Bank campaign. 
        The autonomists saw the action as an example of an action form worth repeating, 
        and, surprisingly, there were none of the usual condemnations by the reformists!</font></p>

              The last straw was one man&#8217;s lengthy paper, which strongly 
              emphasised the classical Leninist-Trotskyist position of the central 
              role of the proletariat (always thought of as male) in the revolutionary 
              movement. The women felt their criticisms were being ignored in 
              two ways: In the preceding months there had actually been a consensus 
              that the critique of the patriarchal structure of society would 
              take a central position in the IMF campaign. Also, the behaviour 
              of us men in discussions corresponded exactly with the women&#8217;s 
              critique of male-dominated culture. The women were fed up with our 
              hypocrisy and established a women&#8217;s meeting.<br>
              At first we men were pretty much at a loss. But time was pressing 
              on. We just had to get on with it. So I found myself in a men&#8217;s 
              group, although I had never been interested in being in a men&#8217;s 
              group. It was interesting that men and women met up for chats in 
              the pub after the meetings. This was important, because at the time, 
              there were no other &#8216;official&#8217; meetings in which both 
              groups could exchange information on how the preparations were going. 
              What seemed from the outside to be a huge argument between women 
              and men seemed a lot less vehement from within.</strong></font><br>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Rifts between the 
        mixed autonomist meeting and the women&#8217;s group become increasingly 
        obvious. The women&#8217;s group concentrated on three issues: government 
        policies on population, genetics and the development of patriarchy, as 
        well as issues to do with the daily experiences in social and &#8216;private&#8217; 
        relationships of those within the left. Essentially, debate within the 
        women&#8217;s group was focussed on whether mixed political work and organisation 
        is possible (or desirable), or whether women need instead to organise 
        themselves without (and against) men, even when the political issues involved 
        aren&#8217;t directly based around conflict between the sexes. In the 
        summer of 1987 the big split came: the women left the IMF meeting.<br>
        The division of the IMF campaign really got tongues wagging. Everybody 
        had something to say, and the whole scene became involved. It wasn&#8217;t 
        just about boring issues like Bretton Woods anymore. Whilst the &#8216;theory 
        group&#8217; and the men&#8217;s group had had big plans for formulating 
        analyses, they only managed to publish a few &#8216;concepts&#8217; by 
        the time the IMF arrived. The women, however, published a pamphlet called, 
        Attempts to Become Reality: Without Us Women, Nothing Goes. It read, &#8220;Our 
        position on how imperialism and patriarchy are linked has only been outlined 
        in the course of our discussions&#8230; There&#8217;s no less incentive 
        in the metropolis for the class struggle, for ongoing resistance to capital, 
        whose attacks reach to every last corner of society, than in the so-called 
        Third World. This could only mean to us women that we need to organise 
        and build resistance to capitalism&#8217;s attack on women, on the female 
        labour potential, their submission in their role of reproducing the commodity 
        of labour. The subjugation of women is the material basis for the exploitation 
        of labour. Wage labour is not possible without the unpaid reproductive 
        work of us women, considered an individual matter and hardly recognised 
        by leftist theories. In this sense, the anti-patriarchal struggle is not 
        part of the anti-imperialist struggle, but its starting point. That is 
        to say, class struggle is only anti-imperialist in our definition if it 
        understands itself as anti-patriarchal at its core.&#8221; They illustrated 
        the significance of the split: &#8220;Because of this issue, the West 
        Berlin meeting divided into a women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s meeting a 
        year ago. Our group was not only divided over theory, but also in the 
        reality of our discussions. [&#8230;] Their [the men&#8217;s] inability 
        to listen to women, to be interested in their point of view and to follow 
        their thought processes leads to us always being forced to see the men&#8217;s 
        ideas and theories and help them develop them with our questions and objections, 
        but not to develop our own ideas. This is what we call exploitation. That 
        we haven&#8217;t withdrawn ourselves as women, but realised a split into 
        a women-only and men&#8217;s meeting was an important step for us, because 
        this shows that theories developed by men always will only be male theories.&#8221; 
        The pamphlet continued, &#8220;Women are neither as patient or powerless 
        as they are presented in many analyses. We are convinced that the main 
        strategies that are currently being examined within the IMF campaign are 
        shaped significantly by the fact that they will have to react to forms 
        of women&#8217;s resistance, whether invisible (or perceived to be invisible) 
        or open.&#8221; This is evident throughout the pamphlet. &#8220;We have 
        tried to draw up the different areas of society, from genetics and population 
        policies to sex tourism and immigration politics, through to the worldwide 
        re-structuring of capital, in which women&#8217;s struggles against our 
        submission and exploitation are played out. We ourselves still do this 
        too much, with the view that women are the eternal victims. This is because 
        it&#8217;s difficult to liberate female subjectivity from the domination 
        of patriarchal theories, and this is an important part of our struggle.&#8221;<br>
        An attempt at international networking began in late 1987. There was a 
        meeting in Zurich with representatives of seven liberation movements from 
        South and Central America and the Philippines. Meanwhile, there were also 
        mobilisation tours in Italy, Spain and Greece. People from Holland and 
        Denmark kept up-to-date personally with visits to West Berlin. Groups 
        from across Europe were definitely planning on travelling to West Berlin 
        for the Summit. Movement meetings and newsletters began including discussions 
        and information about the IMF campaign - there were even contacts formed 
        in East Berlin.<br>
        Despite a none-too-encouraging political climate created by repression 
        (following a series of Rote Zora bombings), the autonomists&#8217; militant 
        campaign against the IMF kicked off in April 1988 with arson attacks on 
        six banks (and three more having their windows broken) in a single night.<br>
        Meanwhile, a more public mobilisation also took place with an anti-imperialist 
        tour of the &#8216;centres of domination&#8217; in West Berlin. The tour, 
        organised by autonomists, visited factories, corporate stores and institutions 
        seen to &#8216;organise and profit from exploitation worldwide&#8217;. 
        The bus trip was forbidden, and was accompanied and disrupted by the cops. 
        It got a huge amount of publicity. Altogether, 20 anti-imperialist tours 
        were organised in the run-up to the Conference, with over 1,000 people 
        taking part.<br>
        The TAZ, a liberal newspaper, planned to organise its own conference in 
        spring 1988, inviting both critics and representatives of the IMF and 
        World Bank. After threats from the autonomists, the conference was eventually 
        cancelled.<br>
        As the Summit approached, fears began to grow, as did a spirit of defiance! 
        People began warning about the dangers of escalating conflicts, warning 
        that a defeat would divide the movement and that &#8216;they&#8217; would 
        close down everything, attack actions and demonstrations, forbid everything 
        and arrest everybody if people stuck to the slogan &#8220;Disrupt this 
        Conference!&#8221;. The on-going court cases and persecution of those 
        accused of being involved with Rote Zora and Revolutionary Cells (another 
        guerrilla group) added to the atmosphere of fear. Some people even rescheduled 
        their summer holidays for the autumn, so as not to have to witness the 
        defeat.<br>
        +++4th May 1988, the national daily newspaper Die Welt runs the headline: 
        &#8220;Terrorists threaten a massacre in Berlin.&#8221; The article quotes 
        the head of the National Crime Authority as saying, &#8220;Terrorists 
        are joining up with autonomists and non-aligned groups to commit acts 
        of violence during the IMF and World Bank Conference in West Berlin in 
        September.&#8221; The Senator of Berlin commented in the article that 
        the cops are faced with their &#8220;most difficult task since the war&#8221; 
        in protecting the 10,000 delegates, and that the entire borough of Kreuzberg 
        would, &#8220;if needed&#8221; be sealed off from the rest of the city. 
        The Senator declares that he will have &#8220;solved the autonomist problem&#8221; 
        by September.+++</font></p>

        The Interim, a Berlin-based weekly paper which published movement discussion 
        documents, commentary and flyers, carried an article titled, &#8216;On 
        the Current State of the IMF Campaign&#8217;. It commented, &#8220;In 
        the campaign against the IMF and World Bank a new form is developing: 
        In both main tendencies - the reformists and the radical left - an alliance 
        is rejected because theoretical as well as practical differences forbid 
        this. At the same time - and this is remarkably new - both parties are 
        pointing to the danger of the shared opponent distracting us by making 
        the differences between reformists and the radical left the main issue. 
        From this, the practical conclusion has been made that there will be exchanges 
        of information on the campaign, and a &#8216;schedule&#8217;&#8230; which 
        has found approval in both camps. The first rule is: False common interests 
        weaken us, blur things and benefit the opponent - this is why they should 
        be separated by space, time and form of action&#8230; The forms of action 
        will not be limited in a one-dimensional way: The radical left will participate 
        in the legal, non-violent resistance where and when they feel it makes 
        sense, and also many &#8216;reformist groups&#8217; will not desist from 
        examining the legitimacy of police and state measures on their own initiative. 
        This highly charged mix of very different actions - legal, but also unwanted, 
        mass actions down to illegal small actions - is to increase in effectiveness 
        and disruption until the Conference ends&#8230; the radical left claims&#8230; 
        to demonstrate that resistance to imperialism is more worth acknowledging 
        and reporting in the metropolis of capital, than the hypocritical declarations 
        of the IMF and World Bank.&#8221;<br>
        +++26th June 1988: On the pretext of searching for the Red Army Faction 
        [West Germany&#8217;s most well-known urban guerrillas] the cops set up 
        three &#8216;Special Control Points&#8217;, to check people&#8217;s IDs 
        and carry out searches. It is obvious to everyone that these points are 
        part of the state&#8217;s preparation for the Conference.+++<br>
        The autonomists hoped that the mobilisation would be broad enough, and 
        the range of potential targets large enough, that the cops wouldn&#8217;t 
        be able to prevent actions from taking place by shutting down certain 
        parts of the city. Nevertheless, the situation was prepared for. A statement 
        was issued, explaining, &#8220;For everybody to have unhindered freedom 
        of movement during the Summit, we are calling for everyone to quickly 
        get themselves smart clothes and maybe even second homes.&#8221;<br>
        Militant actions really got going in the last few months before the Conference. 
        One day in June, all Metro travel was declared &#8216;free&#8217; and 
        ticket machines and ticket sales offices were glued shut at 11 Metro stations. 
        In July, five Shell garages were attacked in one night.<br>
        By early summer, 1988, both the women&#8217;s and the men&#8217;s groups 
        were suffering from internal problems so serious that they were barely 
        capable of organising the infrastructure for the actions. It became increasingly 
        clear that those &#8216;responsible&#8217; for the campaign would not 
        get much together themselves. In response, a lot more people began to 
        take on responsibilities, freeing up those who had been involved for longer 
        to start preparing what they were personally going to do.<br>
        As the Conference drew closer, preparations became more intensive, and 
        more people began taking on tasks, initiating discussions and (finally) 
        forming action groups. In one large meeting a framework was developed 
        for carrying out the days of action, organising sleeping spaces, an information 
        and news systems, a legal team, autonomous first-aiders and people to 
        keep an eye on the movements of the cops. The whole lengthy, lethargic 
        preparation process was over.<br>
        In August there was an arson attack on the villa of a banker who was involved 
        in the PR department of a credit institution&#8217;s development sector. 
        The communiqu&eacute; was signed, &#8220;Committee for a Flaming Resistance 
        to the IMF/World Bank Conference&#8221;.<br>
        +++11th August 1988: Using anti-terrorist legislation, a state of emergency 
        is declared in West Berlin for the period surrounding the IMF and World 
        Bank Conference.+++<br>
        A few days after this, a clandestine group visited a West Berlin hotel 
        planning on hosting delegates. They spray painted the walls, cut the phone 
        lines and poured oil over the furniture. Reformist groups were questioned 
        by the media about the actions, and were asked to distance themselves 
        from autonomists and &#8216;terrorist actions&#8217;. They explained (as 
        agreed): &#8220;Every group is responsible for choosing and justifying 
        their own form of resistance themselves.&#8221;<br>
        In mid-August, rumours abounded that representatives of the city of Berlin 
        and the IMF/World Bank were discussing re-locating to Tokyo at short notice, 
        if resistance to the Summit proved to be too strong. Meanwhile, the head 
        of the National Crime Department commissioned from the secret services 
        a list of &#8216;travelling, violent offenders&#8217; to be stopped on 
        their way to West Berlin, and a series of raids was carried out across 
        Germany on the pretext of searching for the Red Army Faction, and those 
        involved in the IMF campaign.<br>
        +++East Berlin: Nothing is to be read about the IMF and World Bank Conference 
        in the East German media. Especially nothing about East Germany&#8217;s 
        support for the bankers meeting in West Berlin. Both Interhotels in East 
        Berlin, and the newly opened Grand Hotel, are fully booked. Representatives 
        of international banks did this on their own initiative. Luxury limousines 
        are to take these men to the Conference Centre in West Berlin every day.+++<br>
        By the time September &#8216;88 arrives there was a lot of preparation 
        going on. The counter-conference was prepared, with high-profile scientists 
        invited. The peaceful mass demonstration taking place the day before the 
        Conference got widespread support, and the majority of the autonomists 
        agreed to join under the agreed principle of &#8216;no different forms 
        of action at the same time and place&#8217;.<br>
        Grassroots activists formed the &#8216;Office of Unusual Measures&#8217; 
        and planned to carry out a large number of public actions and ironic spectacles. 
        Preparation and agitation for the days of action was carried out in close 
        co-ordination with the autonomists.<br>
        The closer the date of the Conference got, the more active the militant 
        opponents of the IMF became. On September 5th, 13 company cars belonging 
        to Siemens, and three cars belonging to a car hire company catering to 
        the Conference delegates were set on fire by an autonomous cell. A few 
        days later, nine arson attacks were carried out against banks. More attacks 
        were carried out over the next few days. On September 19th, the offices 
        of the company responsible for laying telephone lines and installing computers 
        at the Conference site were set alight.<br>
        The preparation among the autonomists themselves was, however, not unified. 
        Many of the theoretical groups failed to produce their analyses with the 
        practical conclusions for resistance that they&#8217;d promised. Some 
        individuals from these groups withdrew altogether, while others got stuck 
        in the practical preparations - especially for the final demonstration.<br>
        The groups surrounding the Latin America Centre managed to produce pamphlets 
        and flyers for the mobilisation at the last minute, which would not have 
        been possible without the help of those who had recently become involved. 
        A lot of people were asking themselves exactly why the years of preparation 
        had been necessary.<br>
        On September 20th the Red Army Faction fired a shotgun at the armoured 
        limousine of the Secretary of State. The next day the Senator of Justice 
        claimed that the delegates&#8217; security was guaranteed. Nine thousand 
        cops were on duty and all people, hotels, banks and corporations considered 
        to be &#8216;threatened&#8217; were either overtly protected or covertly 
        surveyed. The cops in Kreuzberg stepped up searches and relied heavily 
        on evidence gathered by undercover spies who &#8216;fit in&#8217; to the 
        scene.</font></p>

                Activists were strangely hesitant to get down to preparing concrete 
                actions. In hindsight, it seems that the intensive discussion 
                around the issues for the days of action was just an expression 
                of an attempt to hide the fear of carrying out actions. Throughout 
                the spring of 1988, the media created a lot of hype about the 
                actions, and people felt very threatened by repression, but nobody 
                felt able to talk about these fears. This all came to a climax 
                in what became known as &#8216;The Silent Meeting&#8217;.<br>
                The meeting was held in a community hall which was full to the 
                brim and was supposed to be an opportunity to discuss action ideas 
                - but nobody from the preparation groups was willing to present 
                the concept. After a while, everyone left. It was more than de-mobilising, 
                it was a catastrophe. It was amazing how intimidating the repression 
                of the rulers could be for us. For me, it was clear from the start: 
                we were risking quite a lot, we could go to prison. But we had 
                so much to win, so much strength and personality. We could show 
                that the world was still changeable - and that&#8217;s worth a 
                few years in prison. Our mistake was never speaking about our 
                fears and doubts in a larger circle and never making this an issue 
                that we dealt with</strong></font>.<br>

        Tokyo.+++<br>
        The counter-conference began in the University of Art. The opening event 
        against the Summit, a taxi demonstration, was successful. Many people 
        were nervous about potential arrests, attacks by reactionary colleagues, 
        the seizure of taxis and the like. Despite these worries, more taxis than 
        expected took part.<br>
        <strong>Saturday 24th September</strong><br>
        The reformists remain active: At 8 am the counter-conference resumes.<br>
        10 am: The Zahltag newspaper about the Summit mobilisation is distributed 
        across the city. During the days of action there are up to 50,000 up-to-date 
        editions produced every day.<br>
        12 noon-8 pm: The BUKO pharmaceuticals campaign bus parks up in a city 
        square and performs street theatre, other theatre groups also take part.<br>
        8:30 pm-9 pm: Drummers from across the world meet in the city square for 
        a performance organised by &#8216;The Office for Unusual Measures&#8217;. 
        The cops are everywhere, but the drumming provides cover for people, disguised 
        in suits, to create all kinds of chaos.<br>
        Meanwhile, in the late-afternoon the autonomists hold a final meeting, 
        where they discuss various kinds of worst-case scenarios. There are rumours 
        of entire parts of the city being sealed off, the mass arrest of anyone 
        who looks &#8216;alternative&#8217;, and people being preventatively detained. 
        A few people dress up smart and head off to check out the city. They come 
        back with good news and - at last - the autonomists join the action.<br>
        <strong>Sunday 25th September</strong><br>
        The pre-Conference demo is one of the biggest in the post-war history 
        of Berlin.<br>
        11 am: The march to the Conference Centre begins. The mood is aggressive 
        and 80,000 people are there! The demonstration is colourful and surprisingly 
        militant. The cops hold back, as do the few black-clad demonstrators (in 
        accordance with the no-different-forms-of-action-in-the-same-place-at-the-same-time 
        agreement). Everyone&#8217;s confidence rises, and even those who were 
        most afraid now find the courage to take part in the up-coming days of 
        action.<br>
        8-9 pm: The forbidding of the &#8216;fire-drumming&#8217; event doesn&#8217;t 
        have much effect upon it. Loads of people turn up, and head off to track 
        down and insult Conference delegates, blow whistles in front of hotels 
        and pull faces at people eating in posh restaurants. In a few restaurants, 
        tables are looted and over-turned.<br>
        In short: The day is a victory!<br>
        Meanwhile, on the other side of The Wall: On Sunday evening, around 800 
        mainly young people occupy a church in East Berlin to put their criticisms 
        of the IMF and World Bank into practice. The East Berlin week of action, 
        organised by autonomous groups and various grassroots church organisations 
        began on the Friday with a benefit concert. On Saturday and Sunday a seminar 
        was held to question the idea of a &#8216;just&#8217; world economic order. 
        Representatives of national liberation movements, and experts from the 
        Eastern Bloc were invited. Almost 80 participants discussed the future 
        of capitalist industry and the developing world, the role of the IMF and 
        World Bank, and whether it is possible to &#8216;democratise&#8217; the 
        world economic order, or whether it needs to be abolished.<br>

              What should you do when you&#8217;ve had nothing to do with the 
              anti-IMF preparation? When you haven&#8217;t been to any of the 
              hundreds of meetings? When you have no &#8216;insider info&#8217;? 
              I decide, with a mate, to go for the decadent option. We spent about 
              &pound;350 each on shoes and a suit and headed off to the Opera!<br>
              Outside was a ring of demonstrators and a tight line of cops. The 
              Opera was completely sealed off and nobody was coming in without 
              a ticket. Except for us. Dressed up smart, we explained, helplessly, 
              that my father was inside with tickets and was waiting for us. We 
              had cleared the first hurdle. After that, getting past the second 
              checkpoint was easy. They thought we wouldn&#8217;t even have gotten 
              there if we didn&#8217;t have tickets. But the final checkpoint 
              was impossible to get past without actually having a ticket.<br>
              What were we to do? We were completely surrounded by cops. We could 
              either start a fight with a yuppie, or start shouting slogans and 
              get kicked out. It looked, for a while, like we weren&#8217;t going 
              to be able to do anything. It was gutting. Outside everyone was 
              having a laugh, and here we were standing around like idiots. <br>
              Then came our saving grace. We spotted the Chief of Police, standing 
              around joking with a group of people. We were off! We mingled into 
              the group, then quickly slapped him on the back of the head. He 
              turned around, but saw nobody but yuppies. As we tried to leave 
              we were stopped just before we reached the last line of cops. The 
              one that grabbed me punched me and threw me against a wall and tried 
              to search me. I was furious, and demanded that he let me go so as 
              I could remove my jacket and stop it getting damaged. Unbelievably, 
              he let me go and apologised. We were arrested and eventually released.

        +++The Conference begins.+++<br>
        The programme for the next day remains fairly united: The early-risers 
        gather from 7 am in front of the airport and hotels, equipped with all 
        the instruments and costumes imaginable. Throughout the day, prepared 
        and pre-publicised actions and rallies are held, despite an enormous police 
        presence. By night, the Conference delegates and their luxury cars are 
        sought out.<br>
        10-12 am: The day&#8217;s actions begin with rallies in front of HQ of 
        Adler and the ADIA temping agency.<br>
        12-4 pm: Anti-nuclear action at Siemens office - &#8220;No Energy for 
        the Conference!&#8221;<br>
        5-6 pm: Actions against sex tourism at travel agents and porn shops.<br>
        7 pm: At the same time as the Gala Evening at the German National Opera, 
        an alternative cultural event is organised by &#8216;the anarchists&#8217;, 
        and more bankers are harassed. Alongside the &#8216;official&#8217; actions, 
        groups continue to suddenly appear at banks, sex shops, insurance companies, 
        restaurants and hotels, leaving behind traces of their mood.<br>
        +++In the meantime, the Conference delegates and the security forces become 
        nervous. Instead of going to the opera in their luxury cars, they are 
        shipped there - on grounds of security - in their finest clothes, in ordinary 
        buses. They are returned to their hotels amidst a massive police presence. 
        Some delegates, however, still thought it possible to have a look around 
        the city. The newspapers go wild when outrageous stories hit the headlines, 
        such as the former Japanese Foreign Minister being ripped from his car. 
        Some delegates begin to consider a hasty departure, others suggest that 
        the Conference be cut short.+++<br>

        The anti-IMF Women&#8217;s&#8217; Group wants to repeat a successful piece 
        of action theatre. The piece is, however, forbidden due to &#8216;disturbances&#8217; 
        the previous night. All the women who attempt to take part are detained, 
        identified and arrested, and - after a long wait - released. To celebrate 
        their release, many of the women take part in the &#8216;re-designing&#8217; 
        of a travel agency. The Korean Ambassador, who happened to be visiting 
        the agency at the time, later complained to the Conference organisers 
        and the press about the unfortunate damage done to his expensive suit.<br>
        Demos also take place in front of pharmaceutical and insurance companies, 
        and the German Institute for Development. A bicycle action takes place 
        in Neukoeln and Wedding (districts on the outskirts of West Berlin) whilst 
        Latin American Solidarity Groups hold actions in the centre of the city, 
        highlighting the exploitation involved in coffee production, the activities 
        of the Contras in Nicaragua and the power of large landowners.<br>
        In the meantime, a huge bike convoy is making its way to the Conference 
        Centre. The cops had barely noticed, and ended up having to chase the 
        convoy, in full riot gear, on foot. Some bikes were eventually blocked 
        at an intersection by cop vans, but others made it all the way to the 
        Conference Centre!<br>
        In the evening: The &#8216;fire drumming&#8217; action of previous nights 
        is repeated.<br>
        +++ It was now too late to move the Conference, that would have meant 
        &#8216;giving in&#8217; to those on the streets. There was also no real 
        option of clearing &#8216;the mob&#8217; from the streets through force 
        - that would have been too chaotic. The only solution was to keep the 
        delegates in their hotels, shipping them around the city in secured convoys, 
        and pleading that they keep their criticisms of the organisation of the 
        Conference until the closing meeting.+++<br>
        +++&#8221;I&#8217;m totally impressed by the other side.&#8221; said one 
        Berlin cop, ironically. &#8220;Their plans are working. Every target that 
        they set themselves, they&#8217;ve achieved.&#8221; In contrast, the cops 
        were in total chaos.+++<br>
        Wednesday 28th September<br>
        7 am: Bankers are harassed leaving their hotel, whilst meandering demos 
        visit dole offices, deportation police headquarters and the Stock Exchange. 
        There was chaos across the entire city - and all of it was being documented 
        by the world&#8217;s media.<br>
        In the afternoon, a huge convoy of cars drives through the city looking 
        for bankers, whilst &#8216;ordinarily&#8217; dressed people wander around 
        the city with little boxes of matches in their pockets hoping to create 
        as much chaos as they can. They were fairly successful.<br>
        Due to the amount going on during the day, very little took place that 
        evening.<br>

        September</strong><br>
        This was intended to be the &#8216;highpoint&#8217; of the mobilisation.<br>
        Early in the morning, numerous routes from the delegates&#8217; hotels 
        to the Conference Centre were simultaneously blockaded by barricades of 
        burning cars. Despite delays, however, the Conference eventually gets 
        going.<br>
        At 4pm the Berlin cops show the Revolutionary Internationalist Demonstration 
        their military superiority by battering their way into the demonstration 
        using highly trained anti-terrorist police. Despite inflicting a lot of 
        injuries, they aren&#8217;t able to stop the demo from leaving - and the 
        very intelligent decision to end the demo early meant that the clashes 
        in the city centre planned by the cops were avoided.<br>
        +++The official programme and the boring resolutions were barely mentioned 
        at the IMF and World Bank&#8217;s closing press conference. The main question 
        addressed was whether or not the next Meeting should be cancelled.+++</font></p>

              Among the many great ideas we had in September 1988 was the plan 
              to cut off the power supply for the IMF Conference. We did have 
              experience in making molotovs and timed explosives, but we weren&#8217;t 
              too up on Berlin&#8217;s electricity networks. Of course no one 
              could just go to the electricity companies and ask where the important 
              lines were. But our research beforehand could have been more thorough.<br>
              In the end, we were convinced that some principle of circular flow 
              existed: If one junction failed, a second would jump in. So if the 
              ring for the Conference Centre was interrupted at two points - we 
              hoped - the supply would collapse, apart from any backup generators 
              that, of course, probably existed. But just a short flickering of 
              the spotlights in the Conference Centre would have been a nice success. 
              <br>
              We found the two nearest transformer stations and tried to set them 
              on fire at the same time. Of course we were quite nervous, as the 
              city was on the highest security alert and there were cops everywhere.<br>
              Something didn&#8217;t seem to work. We never found out what went 
              wrong. Did the ignitions fail? Was the fire not fed enough? Were 
              the fire brigades too quick? Or, is this the best kept secret of 
              the IMF: that the delegates now always go places with candles in 
              their pockets - just in case? </strong></font> </p>

        The Pitfalls of high demands- or why did everyone split up afterwards?</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">+++Altogether there 
        were almost 1,000</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> arrests during the 
        days of action - all but one were released. Three hundred cop cars and 
        40 bankers&#8217; cars were damaged, and 150 windows broken. In West Berlin 
        alone, police counted 110 arson attacks in 1988 in connection with the 
        IMF Conference. Representatives of the autonomists and anti-imperialists 
        declare that the days of action and Thursday&#8217;s demonstration were 
        &#8220;a complete success&#8221;, as they managed to &#8220;conduct a 
        political and practical attack on the ruling class.&#8221;+++<br>
        +++The TAZ newspaper reports in early October, &#8220;There was a debate 
        yesterday in Parliament about the limitation of the freedom to demonstrate 
        and the freedom of the press during the IMF and World Bank Conference 
        in West Berlin. Members of the CDU/CSU and FPD claim that the Green Party 
        and the Alternative List, among others, fabricated a civil war-like situation 
        in West Berlin. The CSU member Zeitlmann said a &#8220;dangerous situation&#8221; 
        had been created by &#8220;the anarchists&#8221;, that only led to one 
        conclusion: &#8220;We had 8,500 soldiers in the city to protect the lives 
        of the 12,000 bankers.&#8221; The Senator of Berlin justified again the 
        police&#8217;s handling of the situation.&#8221;+++<br>
        Compared to the broad discussions before the Conference, only a few autonomists 
        participate in the evaluation of the campaign. There is consensus on considering 
        the days of action as a success. An activist writes in the Interim of 
        October 7th, 1988: &#8220;If we are talking about success, we must ask 
        ourselves what our goal was. We didn&#8217;t prevent the IMF Conference. 
        That was &#8216;successfully&#8217; held. The actual prevention wouldn&#8217;t 
        have been possible short of a people&#8217;s uprising. Of course we knew 
        this beforehand. But we did succeed in attacking the IMF and World Bank&#8230; 
        We saw scenes taking place here in West Berlin that we previously only 
        had seen on TV when US State dignitaries visited Latin America. It was 
        reported in El Pais, the most important Spanish daily newspaper, that 
        &#8220;the city collapsed&#8221; on two evenings in a row. They report, 
        miffed, that the Spanish Ambassador&#8217;s car was totalled. The Ambassador 
        was lucky enough to get out of the way seconds before. The English Guardian 
        reports that the Conference would not have been possible without massive 
        police protection against &#8220;radical opponents&#8221; and that the 
        city scene had been dominated by protest. We have probably managed to 
        send out a picture of resistance to the whole world. And this has a significance 
        that we shouldn&#8217;t underestimate&#8230; As to the declared goal of 
        autonomous and anti-imperialist groups - that of focusing beyond the Conference 
        on the structures of imperialism here in the metropolis - there is much 
        food for thought. Our demonstrations and actions were carefully prepared 
        theoretically over a long time. Even so (or maybe because of this), we 
        remained amongst ourselves during the actions. We were obviously not able 
        to mobilise many with this. The main trigger of mass resistance, the drumming 
        on the Breitsheidplatz, didn&#8217;t even belong to the autonomist action 
        plan&#8230; But now the success must be measured in what comes after. 
        First, this campaign is probably a turning point for us. For many it was 
        an important radicalisation, allowing for new political perspectives and 
        structures to be developed. There are also probably many who are just 
        glad it&#8217;s over without having been a disaster.&#8221;<br>
        Looking back now, it&#8217;s amazing that people put so much energy into 
        producing discussion documents and holding meetings to mobilise, yet hardly 
        any serious evaluation exists. The last issue of the Unzertrennlich looked 
        extensively at the division between &#8216;old and new internationalism&#8217;, 
        and compared their different analyses - but that&#8217;s about it.<br>
        The autonomists worked towards the IMF/World Bank Summit for a long time. 
        For weeks, the IMF opponents had been in the spotlight of the world&#8217;s 
        media. As things returned to ordinary political life, it was difficult 
        for people to come down from the fight against the Big Bosses and return 
        to the struggles against the small property owners and dealing with the 
        porn cinema next door.<br>
        The structures built up for the campaign dissolved, and the others returned 
        to their usual level of activity. Unfortunately, none of this was done 
        in a pre-planned process of bringing the campaign to an end. Many had 
        the feeling of having &#8216;fallen into a big hole&#8217; after September. 
        &#8216;Where now?&#8217; was the thought - not only of many new-comers, 
        but also of a lot of the old-timers from the internationalist scene.<img src="/web/20110511121605im_/http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/images/small_20images/book-cover.jpg" width="462" height="414" align="left"></font></p>

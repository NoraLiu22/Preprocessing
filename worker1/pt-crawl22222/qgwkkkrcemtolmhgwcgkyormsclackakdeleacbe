<p class="text-bold">A sketch of prior documentation of epi-Olmec texts</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="21">The Tuxtla Statuette</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
Work on epi-Olmec writing began with the publication of the Tuxtla Statuette &#40;Holmes 1902&#41;. The incising on the hard stone was clear, and the image is visually engaging, so the object has been widely published both in photographs and in relatively accurate drawings.</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="22">Cerro de las Mesas Stela 5, 6, 8, and 15</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
Although the fame of the La Mojarra stela has led scholars to think of epi-Olmec writing and culture as a Late Preclassic phenomenon, the largest body of known epi-Olmec texts comes from the Classic period occupation at Cerro de las Mesas.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The monuments of Cerro de las Mesas came to the attention of scholars by the 1920s, but only became generally accessible through the published investigations of Matthew Stirling &#40;1943&#41;. The texts were badly weathered. Stirling&#146;s drawings give a sense of the degree of preservation of signs on Stela 6 and Stela 8, but, with one exception, the representation of the non-calendrical signs in these drawings was not accurate. In particular, none of the signs as represented in these drawings resembled any sign on the Tuxtla Statuette, and the script was not recognized as having any relationship with the epi-Olmec script. Instead, its long count dates again invited an association with Mayan writing, and three of the four legible day signs &#40;on Stela 6, 8, and 15&#41; were noted as resembling Mayan day signs. Least accurate is Stirling&#146;s drawing of Stela 5; it shows no trace of any writing whatsoever on the raised glyph panel, although that panel in fact bears a legible long count date. Stirling&#146;s data nonetheless proved useful for investigations into the format of the script and of the long count system &#40;Prem 1971, 1973; Graham 1971; Justeson <span class="text-italic">et al.</span> 1985&#41;, particularly for their bearing on interrelationships among different writing systems during the Preclassic era.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The monuments have been on public display at the Museo de Antropolog&iacute;a of the Universidad Veracruzana in Xalapa, Veracruz, so visiting scholars and the general public alike at least had direct access to these texts.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
An album of photographs of monuments in the museum was published by Medell&iacute;n Zenil in 1971.&nbsp; These photographs were quite good, considering that they were taken outdoors using, apparently, only the available sunlight. Several epi-Olmec signs can be detected in these photographs. However, the fact was seemingly not recognized by anyone at the time; even in the publication of the La Mojarra stela by the then-director of the same museum &#40;Winfield Capitaine 1988&#41;.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Javier Urcid has been drawing these monuments of Cerro de las Mesas and others that appear to be from in and near the Mixtequilla; to our knowledge, his results are not yet published.</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="23">The Chapultepec Stone</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
Stirling &#40;1943:pp&#41; recognized that the sculpture on the Chapultepec Stone was nearly identical to that on Cerro de las Mesas Stela 5.&nbsp; He states that the monument was taken from the village of San Miguel Chapultepec, in Mexico City &#150; it is not from the apocryphal &quot;San Miguel Chapultepec, Veracruz&quot;, as is sometimes stated &#150; although he suspected that it was in fact from Veracruz given its general relationship to several of the monuments at Cerro de las Mesas and to Stela 5 most specifically.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Thanks to its deep relief and hard stone, this monument is extremely well preserved. Partly as a result, several quite acceptable photographs of it have been published in several books and articles dealing with Mesoamerican art. Stirling&#146;s drawing of the monument is a fairly good guide to the details of the sculpture and text, but Porter&#146;s unpublished drawing certainly improves on it.</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="24">Tres Zapotes Stela C</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
The lower half of Tres Zapotes Stela C was discovered by Stirling and shown to have borne the date 7.16.6.16.18.&nbsp; This date replaced that of the Tuxtla Statuette as the earliest then known. At the time, there was resistance to accepting so seemingly early a date at face value &#150; Thompson &#40;1943&#41; argued that it was a Late Classic monument using a long count based on a 400-day year &#150; Coe &#40;1957&#41; showed that it and other early long count dates conformed to the standard Mayan mathematical format. This was confirmed by the later discovery of the upper half of the stela a few meters away.</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="25">Chiapa de Corzo</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
The next substantially legible text was that on a sherd discovered during the excavations of the New World Archaeological Foundation &#40;NWAF&#41; in fill intrusive into a burial at Chiapa de Corzo. This sherd dates to the Francesa phase &#40;450-300 BCE&#41;, and is the oldest currently dateable epi-Olmec text. Although the published drawing was seriously flawed, two repeated signs appeared to be rather similar to signs on the Statuette.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The NWAF excavations also turned up an inscribed wall panel, misleadingly designated as &quot;Stela 2&quot;. All that survives of its text is the day sign and the end of a long count, reconstructible as 7.16.3.2.13, making it the earliest fully recoverable long count date currently known. It dates to less than four years before Tres Zapotes Stela C.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Its text is recognizable as epi-Olmec &#150; that is, as part of the same script tradition as the La Mojarra stela and the Tuxtla Statuette &#150; both on the basis of a day sign shared with Cerro de las Mesas Stela 15, and because its date conforms to an epi-Olmec cultural practice, a calendrical/astronomical cycle that is characteristic of epi-Olmec texts &#40;see Kaufman and Justeson 2001, Justeson and Kaufman in press&#41;.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The format of the long counts on the Tuxtla Statuette, Tres Zapotes Stela C, the Chiapa de Corzo wall panel, and Cerro de las Mesas Stelae 5, 6, and 8 were recognized to be visually similar, and the format of the calendrics and of the texts as a whole led Prem &#40;1971, 1973; also Graham 1971, Justeson <span class="text-italic">et al.</span> 1985&#41; to identify them as part of the same script tradition.</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="26">The O&#146;Boyle &quot;mask&quot;</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
A text on an object of unknown provenience in a private collection has an inscription that appears to consist of 23 glyphic units &#40;one is treated by Justeson and Kaufman &#91;2001:83-85&#93; as consisting of two units, D4-5, and another is treated as a fusion of two distinct signs&#41;. The object is made of clay, and the glyphs are small with their details often difficult to make out; as a result there are uncertainties about the unit.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
A great number of its signs are shared with the text on the La Mojarra stela, but few are found in the text on the Tuxtla Statuette in an obviously similar form. To our knowledge, the text was associated with the epi-Olmec script only after the publication of the La Mojarra text.</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="27">The La Mojarra stela</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
The stela of La Mojarra was brought to Xalapa&#146;s Museo de Antropolog&iacute;a in 1986.&nbsp; Its text was quite long by Mesoamerican standards, long enough that work on the decipherment of non-calendrical signs became realistic to consider, and several professional and vocational epigraphers have made efforts to contribute to this process. George Stuart made this work possible by producing a highly accurate drawing of the text, a remarkable accomplishment given that it was done under difficult viewing conditions.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The stela was kept in the Museo&#146;s bodega for several years, under a succession of directors; due largely to academic politics, the text was treated as a possible or likely modern fabrication &#40;the reasons that had been put forward being insubstantial and sometimes ill-informed&#41;. Access was highly restricted, generally at the discretion of the director. In 1993, Justeson and Kaufman were provided access for as long as they liked, though they were not allowed to bring in any recording devices or media including paper or pencil; several others were admitted for just 15 minutes, in at least one case with a video camera; and some recognized scholars were denied access.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
All of this changed in the September, 1995, when Sara Ladr&oacute;n de Guevara became director of the museum. Without taking a position on the authenticity of the monument, in view of the world-wide attention it had received, and in view of the steady stream of both academic and non-academic visitors who visited Xalapa to examine it, she chose to make it available to all by directing that it be put on permanent public display. Throughout her 4-year tenure as director of the Museo, and now that she is again serving in that capacity, Ladr&oacute;n de Guevara has been and continues to be extremely helpful in facilitating access to this monument and all of the others in the collection; in particular, she made it possible for Justeson to work on the epi-Olmec monuments during the night for a cumulative total of more than a month, in addition to the access she has provided to us during the current project.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
While the monument was being prepared for display, a geologist brought to the attention of archaeologist Sergio Vasquez Z. that some of the &quot;erosion lines&quot; on one side of the stela were running the wrong way: Vasquez recognized that these were the remains of a hieroglyphic text. This was made known at the unveiling of the monument in November, 1995.&nbsp; Justeson and Kaufman were advised of the existence of a seemingly relatively short column of eroded glyphs in March 1996.&nbsp; The side text turned out to consist of 35 signs, most of which were legible enough to identify.</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="28">The Teotihuac&aacute;n-style mask</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
Only one object bearing an epi-Olmec text has come to light since 1986 &#40;Houston and Coe 2004&#41;: a mask in Teotihuac&aacute;n style that likely comes either from Teotihuac&aacute;n or from somewhere in Veracruz. This text is a major addition to the corpus; with 104 signs, it is the second longest text in the corpus.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
A preliminary drawing by Joralemon was circulated in the summer of 2002, which made it clear that the text was epi-Olmec.</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="29">The &quot;Alvarado Stela&quot;</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
The Alvarado stela is a tall column of basalt that has a scene spanning two of its sides. On the right side is a tall standing figure, facing a smaller bound, seated Olmec-style figure on the left side. The outstretched hand of the figure reaches out, palm up, as though it is holding up a column of glyphs; in this respect the presentation parallels that on Seibal Stela 12.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The monument has been published in photographs, drawings, and a rubbing. The drawings thus far have not been very explicit in representing the text, apart from the clearly delineated final sign group. During one of his visits, Justeson observed that the uppermost, enlarged sign was in the form of a &quot;lazy 8&quot;, set in something like a glyph panel. Its execution recalls that of the coiled snake in the month patron of the second long count introducing glyph on the La Mojarra stela; the head and tail of the snake, if present, were not clear. There was a possible numeral associated with this sign. The other signs were mostly too difficult to make out, but some had distinctive profiles that did not seem to agree with any known epi-Olmec sign. Based on this observation, the text may be in a form of epi-Olmec writing, but it may be in a distinct variety.</p>

<p class="text-bold-italic"><a name="30">Some epi-Olmec monuments that do not bear texts</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
A number of monuments that do not appear to have texts or to ever have had them, are identified as epi-Olmec based on their shared iconography. Some features are broadly shared; several share certain kinds of base panels, often identifiable iconically with the earth, on which rulers stand &#40;less widely shared and less uniform in execution are sky bands above the main figure&#41;.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The slab stela of El Mes&oacute;n has been of interest in that the main figure generally recalls that of the La Mojarra stela: it is a richly clad figure with a substantial headdress who holds one staff-like object behind him, slanting forward and downward, while the other hand holds another object in front of him.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>In <em><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-destiny-andrew-roberts/">Churchill: Walking with Destiny</a></em> (2018), Andrew Roberts wrote that works about Sir Winston had exceeded 1000. This catalogue piles on, listing more than 1150, about 900 of which we have annotated. Winston Churchill was the subject of his first biography in 1905 when he was 30 years old. The flow hasn’t stopped. Here in the 21st century, 100 years later, some years see over 20 new Churchill titles.</p>
<p>The word “works” denotes any item individually published, from brief pamphlets to books large and small. Compiling and describing them is the purpose of this online listing, which will be updated seriatim. I hope it will serve as a living guide to the vast literature on the Greatest Briton.</p>
<p>This catalogue would not exist without the efforts of two bibliographic pioneers, <a href="https://richardlangworth.com/ashley-redburn" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://richardlangworth.com/ashley-redburn', 'H. Ashley Redburn');">H. Ashley Redburn</a> (1914-1996) and <a href="http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/huntington/rbd/churchill_periodicals.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/huntington/rbd/churchill_periodicals.pdf');">Curt J. Zoller</a> (1920-2014). They worked separately, and then together, updating their findings through the Churchill Societies. Curt also co-authored (with Michael McMenamin) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Winston-Churchill-Untold-American/dp/1846450055" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Winston-Churchill-Untold-American/dp/1846450055', 'Becoming Winston Churchill: The Untold Story of Winston and his American Mentor.');"><em>Becoming Winston Churchill: The Untold Story of Winston and his American Mentor.</em></a> Ashley’s work abides, not least with the Hillsdale College Churchill Project. See “<a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/haking-redburn/">Remembering Richard Haking: The General Who Saved Churchill’s Life</a>.”</p>
<p>Curt Zoller’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Bibliography-Works-Winston-Churchill/dp/0765607344" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Bibliography-Works-Winston-Churchill/dp/0765607344', 'Annotated Bibliography of Works about Sir Winston S. Churchill');"><em>Annotated Bibliography of Works about Sir Winston S. Churchill</em></a> (M.E. Sharpe, 2004) contains the full publishing history of works through that date. It also offers several additional lists not covered here: books and articles “substantially about” Churchill (e.g., the Alanbrooke Diaries); reviews of Churchill’s own works; dissertations and theses. His book remains available, and is the best source for this data.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Works about Winston Churchill</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>1905</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Scott, A. MacCallum. <em>Winston Spencer Churchill</em>. London: Methuen, 1905, 270 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ The first biography, written by an admirer when Churchill was only 31. Though untainted by knowledge of future greatness, the author wrote favorably about young Winston and predicted that he would eventually become prime minister. Crudely reprinted by photocopy in 2010.</p>
<h3><strong>1907</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Leech, H.J. <em>Mr. Winston Churchill</em>. Manchester: Abel Heywood, 1907. </strong>✸ Churchill was “deselected” as Member of Parliament for Oldham after he defied its Conservative majority by becoming a Liberal in 1904. Denied the Tory nomination in Oldham for the general election of January 1905, he was invited to stand as a Liberal for North West Manchester, one of nine Manchester seats, with a tiny electorate of 10,000, a third of whom were Jewish. Churchill spoke strongly for Free Trade, popular in Manchester’s mill industries, and was duly elected.</p>
<h3><strong>1909</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Batchelor, H. Crouch, compiler. <em>Mr. Winston Churchill on the Radical Party: Before He Donned Their Livery and Accepted Their Pay</em>. London: Pall Mall, 1909, 4 pp. softbound. </strong>✸ An attack by a Conservative critic of Churchill’s early career as a Tory before he “crossed the floor” to the Liberals in 1904. Batchelor dwells on Churchill’s earlier critiques of the party he now spoke for.</p>
<h3><strong>1910</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Unknown. <em>Soldier and Statesman: Complete Life of the Rt. Hon. Winston L. Spencer Churchill</em>. London: The Self-Help Press, 1910, 96 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ A brief pamphlet-biography praising Churchill in five chapters, ending with his advocacy of “The People’s Budget” in 1909. Not a political tract, this was part of a series of booklets designed to encourage personal initiative.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1912</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“A Young Scot.” <em>Mr. Winston Churchill’s New Part</em>. Edinburgh: Darien Press, 1912, 16 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ “Mr. Winston Churchill, who advocated Army Reform and economy so eloquently as a Tory in 1900 and 1901&#8230;has now come out in all the panoply of a full-blown Jingo.” Churchill had fought for naval economy in 1908-10; as First Lord of the Admiralty beginning October 1911, he viewed the developing German High Seas Fleet with alarm and began advocating more spending, to the disappointment of his Liberal constituency of Dundee.</p>
<h3><strong>1916</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Scott, A. MacCallum. <em>Winston Churchill in Peace and War</em>. London: Newnes, 1916, 162 pp. </strong>✸ An updated version of Scott’s 1905 biography; still full of admiration, it includes details on the Dardanelles campaign. The author argues that Churchill’s plan for forcing the Dardanelles and taking Turkey out of the war in 1915 was the correct strategic vision: that it failed through lack of military celerity on the scene and political support at home.</p>
<h3><strong>1919</strong></h3>
<p><strong>King, Joseph. <em>The Political Gambler: Being the Record of Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War</em>. Glasgow: Reformers’ Bookstall, 1919, 8 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ In the kind of political irony for which he was well known, Prime Minister Lloyd George made Churchill war minister in 1919 after World War I had ended. Undeterred, Churchill supported the “gamble” of Allied military operations on behalf of the Whites against the Bolsheviks in Russia, but was eventually forced to bow to Cabinet pressure and to bring the British troops home. On the plus side, Churchill was responsible for the successful demobilization of millions of troops from the Western Front.</p>
<p><strong>Sitwell, Osbert. <em>The Winstonburg Line: 3 Satires</em>. London: Bomb Shop, 20 pp., 1919, softbound. </strong>✸ This anti-Churchill polemic publishes verses by Sitwell in the pro-Labour newspapers <em>The Nation</em> and <em>Daily Herald</em>. “A Certain Statesman” attacks Churchill’s actions in Russia, Gallipoli, Antwerp and Sydney Street; “More about Morale” and “The Governess of Europe” add criticism over the Allied military operation in Russia.</p>
<h3><strong>1924</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Captain X [Gibb, Andrew Dewar]. <em>With Winston Churchill at the Front.</em> Glasgow: Cowans and Gray Ltd, 112 pp., 1924, softbound. New edition subtitled <em>Winston in the Trenches 1916. </em>Barnsley, Yorks.: Frontline Books, 256 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/winston-churchill-front-andrew-dewar-gibb/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill took his command in Flanders, dubiously as an exiled politician, but soon earned his soldiers’ respect. Gibb, who served with him, expounds favorably on the transformation. Gibb’s original was a slender volume. The new edition is an odd but useful amalgamation of Gibb’s 1924 text with extractions or rewrites from Sir Martin Gilbert’s <em>The Challenge of War</em> in the official biography. —WJS</p>
<h3><strong>1925</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Keynes, John Maynard. <em>The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill</em>. London: Hogarth Press, 32 pp., 1925, softbound. </strong>✸ A powerful and important critique of Churchill’s direction of Britain’s economy as Chancellor of the Exchequer, the post he held from 1924 to 1929. Keynes particularly attacked Churchill’s decision to return Britain to the Gold Standard, although in doing this he was following the prevailing advice of his financial experts.</p>
<h3><strong>1927</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“Ephesian” [Roberts, C.E. Bechhofer]. <em>Winston Churchill: Being an Account of the Life of the Rt. Hon. Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill.</em> London: Mills and Boon, 1927. Reprints. </strong>✸ One of the earliest full biographies, concluding during his service as Chancellor of the Exchequer: a fascinating view of Churchill in mid-career, with some novel predictions. Later editions updated the story, the last (1940) covering Churchill’s fight against the India Act, the gathering threat of Nazi Germany, and his appointment as prime minister.</p>
<h3><strong>1928</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A Member of the League to Enforce Public Economy. <em>Mr. Churchill’s Budget Pledges and Performances</em>. London: Cobden-Sanderson, 1928, 18 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ A critique of Churchill as Chancellor of the Exchequer, who by now was viewed by some Conservatives to be spending and taxing at unacceptable levels.</p>
<p><strong>Muir, John Ramsay B. <em>Rating Reform: The Right Way and the Wrong Way. An Examination of Mr. Churchill’s Proposals.</em> London: Liberal Publications Department, 1928, 78 pp. </strong>✸ An opposition critique of the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s proposals to reform the fixing of rates or property taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Sydenham of Combe, Col. The Lord, et al. <em>‘The World Crisis’ by Winston Churchill: A Criticism</em>. London: Hutchinson, 192 pp., 1928. Reprints. </strong>✸ A critique of Churchill’s <em>The World Crisis</em>, vol. 3, <em>1916-1918</em>. Contributors also consider the Dardanelles campaign in Churchill’s vol. 2. An important critical work, sufficiently powerful that Churchill replied to it in part in his 1931 abridged edition of <em>The World Crisis</em>. <em>Contributors</em>: Admiral Sir R. Bacon: “Mr. Churchill and Jutland.” Major-General Sir W.D. Bird: “Mr. Churchill’s Opinions: Some Other Points of View.” Major-General Sir F. Maurice: “Joffre, Galliéni and the Marne.” Sir Charles Oman: “The German Losses on the Somme.” Lord Sydenham of Combe: “Mr. Churchill as Historian.”</p>
<h3><strong>1931</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Germains, Victor Wallace. <em>The Tragedy of Winston Churchill</em>. London: Hurst and Blackett, 1931. 288 pp. </strong>✸ An early but typical critique for its era concludes that Churchill is clever but not wise, and that ventures as the Dardanelles caused consequences “irreparable, disastrous and appalling.” Very reflective of contemporary attitudes in the early 1930s.</p>
<h3><strong>1932</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Martin, Hugh. <em>Battle: The Life Story of the Rt. Hon. Winston S. Churchill</em>. London: Sampson, Low and Co., 1932, 246 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ One of only two biographies to appear during the 1930s, when Churchill was considered politically finished. This work should be read alongside Germains (1931) for a distinct contrast in views over Churchill’s future. Includes Churchill letters.</p>
<h3><strong>1934</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Hay, Malcolm V. <em>Winston Churchill and James II of England</em>. London: Harding and More, 1934, 66 pp. </strong>✸ An attack on Churchill’s portrait of King James II in Volume 1 of Churchill’s biography, <em>Marlborough</em>. Accuses Churchill’s ancestor, the First Duke of Marlborough, of disloyalty to the King, based on earlier arguments by Macaulay.</p>
<h3><strong>1939</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rose, Franz Karl Anton. <em>Das Ist Churchill [This Is Churchill]</em>. Munich and Berlin: J.F. Lehmanns, 1939, 96 pp., softbound, text in German. </strong>✸ The first of many anti-Churchill propaganda works, this one attacking his ancestors as well as himself (“Der kleine Marlborough”). It is interesting that he was already considered a menace by the Nazis months before he became Prime Minister.</p>
<h3><strong>1940</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Arthur, Sir George. <em>Concerning Winston Spencer Churchill</em>. London: William Heinemann, 1940, 200 pp. </strong>✸ One of the first of many hagiographic songs of praise of Britain’s new war leader, well written, by a soldier who had served in Egypt and the Boer War.</p>
<p><strong>Broad, Lewis. <em>Winston Churchill: Man of War</em>. London: Hutchinson, 1940, 128 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ First appearance of what would become extensive writings by the biographer Lewis Broad, who would develop his story to comprise eventually two thick volumes.</p>
<p><strong>Buchan, William. <em>Winston Churchill</em>. London: Pilot Press, 1940, 96 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ A brief paean to Churchill’s leadership. “Whether or not you agree with the principles by which Winston Churchill has guided his political life, you will, if you consider his work and writings fairly, be bound to admit that he has been a remarkably true and courageous prophet.”</p>
<p><strong>Cole, Lloyd. <em>Mr. Churchill and the Church</em>. Sussex, Privately printed, 1940, 32 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ The author draws on Churchill’s speeches for “lessons which I am convinced the Church in some senses needs to learn to-day.” The author’s object is to draw church-folk into support for Britain’s war effort.</p>
<p><strong>Dawson, R. MacGregor. <em>Winston Churchill at the Admiralty, 1911-1915</em>. Toronto: Toronto University Press, 1940, 36 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ Offers Churchill as an example in considering the role of a cabinet minister.</p>
<p><strong>De Stäel-Holstein, Baron Lage Fabian Wilhelm. <em>Mr. Churchill and the Opinion of America.</em> Stockholm: Stockholms Bokindustri, 1940, 168 pp., softbound, text in English. </strong>✸ Stresses the importance of America in the political equation of 1940.</p>
<p><strong>Ferrão, Carlos. <em>Churchill: Os Homens a Guerra [Men at War]</em>. Lisbon: Parceria A. M. Pereira, 1940, 62 pp., softbound, text in Portuguese. </strong>✸ Volume II in the collection “Os Homens da Guerra.” Volume I was “Daladier” by Francisco Velloso; volumes promised were “Reynaud” by Artur Portella and “Hitler” by Carlos Ferrão.</p>
<p><strong>Hughes, W.M. <em>Winston Churchill: Warrior-Statesman</em>. Sydney, Australia: John Sands, 1940. </strong>✸ Brief hagiography.</p>
<p><strong>Kraus, René. <em>Winston Churchill</em>. Philadelphia and New York: J.B. Lippincott, 1940, 366 pp. Many reprints.</strong> ✸ A European writer working in the United States, Kraus was highly respected as a biographer of modern figures. Although generally without criticism, his best-seller provides some firsthand views of Churchill and Britain at war. A Japanese edition was published just before Pearl Harbor, an interesting sidelight on Churchill’s standing in what was soon to be an enemy nation.</p>
<p><strong>Persich, Walter. <em>Winston Churchill: Ganz ‘Privat’ [Totally ‘Private’]</em>. Berlin: Otto Schaffer, 1940, 292 pp.; expanded to 336 pp. in 1942, text in German. </strong>✸ The title refers to a series of negative assertions disguised as revelations by the German press. Translations: Czech.</p>
<p><strong>Phelan, James Leo. <em>Churchill <u>Can</u> Unite Ireland.</em> London: Victor Gollancz, 1940, 120 pp. </strong>✸ Argues that the Second World War was Churchill’s opportunity to complete the unification of an Ireland divided by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. WSC himself thought so, cabling Eamon de Valera on 8 December 1941: “Now is your chance. A nation once again! I will meet you wherever you wish.” There was no response, and the Irish Republic remained neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt, Wolfgang. <em>Politische Gewalten in England: Das Kabinett Churchill [Political Forces in England: The Churchill Cabinet].</em> Bonn: Scheur, 1940, 54 pp., text in German. </strong>✸ German propaganda negatively comments on Churchill’s Coalition Cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>Sencourt, Robert (pseudonym for Robert E.G. George). <em>Winston Churchill</em>. London: Faber and Faber, 1940, 310 pp. Translations: Hebrew. </strong>✸ An excellent account of Churchill’s life: racy, readable, highly colored. This work includes a chapter on the quality and power of Churchill’s writings.</p>
<p><strong>Treffz, Hermann. <em>Winston Churchill: Das Leben des Generalverbrechers der Weltgeschichte [The Life of the General Criminal in World History].</em> Fellbach-Stuttgart: W. Baltrusch, 1940, 64 pp.. softbound, text in German. </strong>✸ The Churchill as seen through Nazi eyes reminds one of similar warped visions circulating on the “Twitterverse” 80 years later.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown. <em>A List of the Printed Works of the Prime Minister</em>. London: W.J. Bryce, Ltd., Booksellers, 1940, 4 pp. </strong>✸ An early bibliography-catalogue which confirms that <em>Marlborough</em> was selling for £7, a <em>Malakand Field Force</em> first edition at 7/6 and <em>The River War</em> at 30/-.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown. <em>Paroles dorées de Mr. Churchill adressées à la Nation Française [Golden Words of Mr. Churchill Addressed to the French Nation].</em> Paris: Comité d’Éclaircissement sur les Relations Franco-Anglaises, 1940; 10 pp., texts in English and French. Reprints.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Watchman” [Samuel Vyvyan Trerice Adams]. <em>Churchill: Architect of Victory</em>. London: Hamish Hamilton, 1940, 24 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ An essay based on the chapter “Mr. Winston Churchill” in the author’s book, <em>Right Honourable Gentlemen.</em> Adams was praised by Labour’s <em>Daily Herald</em> as an acute examiner of political personalities, but the <em>Sunday Times</em> wrote: “Certainly fulfills one of the two objects which the author had in writing it—to entertain.”</p>
<h3><strong>1941</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“Allan Junior.” <em>The Premier’s Clarion Calls to Courage</em>. Dundee and London: Valentine and Sons Ltd., 1941, 16 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ A miniature booklet, 2 1/2 x 4,” containing an introduction, poem and commentary by the unidentified author, combined with quotes from Churchill’s 1940-41 speeches.</p>
<p><strong>Broad, Lewis. <em>Winston Churchill</em>. London: Hutchinson, 364 pp.; “Pocket Library” Series, London: National Book Association, 1941, softbound. Reprints and extended editions through 1956; published in two volumes 1958; republished in one volume, 1970. </strong>✸ A long-running, often-extended biography. Heavily pro-Churchill, Broad nevertheless convened an impressive number of resource documents to construct what ended as a good reference work, but not judgmental.</p>
<p><strong>Chaplin, E.D.W. <em>Winston Churchill at Harrow</em>. Harrow: The Harrow Book Shop, 1941, 102 pp.; revised with new introduction, 1941. </strong>✸ An illuminating little book with extensive details and photographs documenting Churchill’s days as a Harrow schoolboy. The later edition adds new material.</p>
<p><strong>Davis, Richard Harding. <em>Young Winston Churchill</em>. New York: Scribners, 1941, 42 pp. </strong>✸ A reprint of the author’s chapter on Churchill as a war correspondent in his <em>Real Soldiers of Fortune </em>(1906). Published to take advantage of Churchill’s World War II fame. Illuminating and useful account by a Boer War contemporary.</p>
<p><strong>Ferdi, Katip. <em>Çöçil Diyor Ki [It Declares Churchill].</em> Ankara: Cankaya Basimevi, 1941, text in Turkish. </strong>✸ The first biography in Turkish.</p>
<p><strong>Fletcher, J.W. <em>A Condensed Life of the Right Honourable Winston Spencer Churchill, C.H.: Prime Minister of Great Britain</em>. Sydney: New Century Press, 1941, 92 pp.</strong> ✸ Brief and fulsome, “with impressions formed from a study of his Literary Works and from collateral reading.”</p>
<p><strong>Guedalla, Phillip. <em>Mr. Churchill: A Portrait</em>. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1941, 348 pp.; several later editions and translations. </strong>✸ A best-seller in its day, written by a onetime severe critic turned admirer. Lacking in archival documentation but well written, this is a useful example of how Churchill was held by most of his countrymen during his finest hours.</p>
<p><strong>Hronek, Jiří. <em>Churchil, život bojovníka [Life Fighter].</em> London: Nâakladem Czechoslovâaka, 1941, 64 pp., text in Czech. </strong></p>

Winston, 250 pp.; several reprints. </strong>✸ A physically beautiful binding containing an engaging if uncritical wartime biography, written from the American viewpoint. A period piece in appearance and style.</p>
<p><strong>Moir, Phyllis<em>. I Was Winston Churchill’s Private Secretary</em>. New York: Wilfred Funk, 1941, 232 pp. Reprints, several translations. </strong>✸ The American author served Churchill only briefly, on his USA lecture tour in 1931. One of the few staffers not devoted to him, she found WSC rude and oblivious of those around him, but says his wife kept him under control. An important personal account, the first by a member of his secretariat.</p>
<p><strong>Nott, Stanley Charles. <em>The Young Churchill</em>. New York, 1941: Coward McCann, 306 pp. </strong>✸ An early attempt to describe his youth relies overmuch on Churchill’s own autobiography, picking up the errors and exaggerations. Still, it has a more comprehensive approach than Davis’s <em>Young Winston Churchill</em> (1941).</p>
<p><strong>Pasemann, Ernest, compiler. <em>Churchills Reden und Taten im Scheinwerfer der Presse und Karikatur [Speeches and Acts in the Spotlight of the Press and Caricature</em>]. Leipzig and Berlin: Lühe Verlag, 1941, 104 pp., text in German. </strong>✸ An attack on everything he stood for, with cartoons to illustrate.</p>

<p><strong>Soward, F.H. <em>Moulders of National Destinies: Winston Churchill: Freedom’s Champion.</em> Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1941, 20 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ An uncritical hymn of praise: “Today, with his wealth of experience, Winston Churchill directs war strategy as no British Prime Minister has ever done in history&#8230;.”</p>
<p><strong>Torriente y Peraza. <em>Cosme de la Winston Churchill</em>. Havana, Cuba, 1941: Historical Academy of Cuba, 20 pp., softbound, text in Spanish. </strong>✸ As above.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown. <em>Armed Forces in Iceland, 16 August 1941</em>. Reykjavik, 1941, 36 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ An illustrated pamphlet describing Churchill’s visit to Iceland on his way back from conferring with Roosevelt at the Atlantic Charter conference in Newfoundland.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown. <em>Englische Urteile über den Bolschewismus sind gewiss unverdächtig. Churchill sah ganz klar, Deutschen Sieg oder bolschewistisches Chaos [English Judgments about Bolshevism Are Certainly above Suspicion.

<p><strong>Ya’ri-Polaskin, Jakob. <em>Winston Churchill.</em> Tel Aviv: Ishim u-meora’ot, 1941, text in Hebrew. </strong></p>
<h3><strong>1942</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cunningham-Reid, Capt. <em>Besides Churchill—Who?</em> London: W.H. Allen, 1942, 128 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ The author was a Member of Parliament who had been highly critical of the appeasement of the Chamberlain government, yet also critical of its successor: in September 1942, Cunningham-Reid asked whether Churchill was unwilling to bomb Rome owing to “Catholic susceptibilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Gallacher, William. <em>The Second Front and Mr. Churchill</em>. London: Communist Party of Great Britain, 1942. </strong>✸ Communist Member of Parliament Willie Gallacher was widely acknowledged to be a Soviet spokesman. (Churchill once retorted: “Shut up, Moscow!”) Here he argues for an early launch of the second front, which Stalin was demanding and Churchill was resisting.</p>
<p><strong>Gibbs-Smith, C. Harvard. <em>Churchill</em>. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1942. </strong>✸ A booklet produced by the British Library of Information, containing photographs of Churchill ranged against excerpts from speeches from May 1940 through March 1941.</p>
<p><strong>Hawthorne, Hildegarde. <em>Long Adventure: The Story of Winston Churchill</em>. New York and London: D. Appleton-Century, 1942, 346 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ A scarce wartime biography which, unlike most, spends 80% of its text on Churchill’s life up to World War II.

Burrow, 1942, 56 pp. softbound. </strong>✸ Horizontal format comic book for young people, illustrations by Mendoza.

<p><strong>Thompson, R.W. <em>The Yankee Marlborough</em>. London: George Allen and Unwin; Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1963, 364 pp. Translations: French. </strong>✸ A critique perhaps overly based on recollections of Churchill’s rueful ex-friend Desmond Morton, who was dropped by WSC and never got over it. Thompson contends that WSC’s American blood gave him energy, his British blood romance, but Kirkus Reviews dissented: “That Churchill is egocentric is not a new charge, but that his was a narcissism so complete that the only person capable of interrupting his self-adoration was his Nanny is a charge repeated and examined at ridiculous length. Churchill is not supposed to have ever felt true friendship, all others in his life existed to be used, etc. The author was evidently fascinated by, rather than admiring of, the man on whom he took notes for years. As a personality portrait, this is sketchy—even naïve—guesswork. As a biography of the public man, it is a denigration.”</p>

An important source work by Churchill’s doctor, this work is tainted by the fact that Churchill was almost always ill when Moran saw him. John Colville remarked: “Lord Moran was never present when history was made, but he was sometimes invited to lunch afterward.” Researchers including Sir Martin Gilbert have found that the diary entries in the book do not coincide with the Moran diaries he examined; for some entries the actual diary is blank.

It drew more criticism than Volume I; Robert Rhodes James called it a restating of Churchill’s own “case for the defence” as presented in his books.</p>

Volume III concentrates on just three years: Churchill at the Admiralty, the Dardanelles debacle, Churchill’s fall from power and his exile in the trenches of Flanders as “the escaped scapegoat.”</p>

London: Minerva, Mandarin softbound, 1990. Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2009. 1168 pp. </strong>✸ This installment covers eighteen years as Churchill becomes Chancellor of the Exchequer, defends the government during the 1926 General Strike, leaves office with his party in 1929, and enters a ten-year sojourn in the political wilderness while reaching his zenith as a writer. Moving into the 1930s, Churchill opposes the India Bill, champions Edward VIII in the Abdication crisis, and warns of trouble to come from Hitler’s Germany. The volume ends as war is declared in September 1939 and Churchill becomes First Lord of the Admiralty almost exactly twenty-five years since he last held that post.</p>

Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2011. 1308 pp. </strong>✸ A precisely written narrative puts the reader at Churchill’s shoulder over the most critical three years in his life and the world’s, as the early events of World War II unfold: Hitler’s triumph on the continent, Britain’s victory in the air, the Blitz, the U-boat war, Hitler’s attack on Russia, Churchill’s first personal contact with Roosevelt at the Atlantic Charter conference in August 1941, Pearl Harbor and the forging of the “Grand Alliance.”</p>

London: Minerva, Mandarin softbound, 1990. Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2013. 1418 pp. </strong>✸ This volume covers the balance of World War II: the great power conferences at Teheran, Yalta and Potsdam; the waxing of American and Soviet power and the decline of Britain’s role as a partner; closing the ring around Germany; arguments over invasion routes; growing concerns about postwar Soviet expansion; the atomic bomb; the election; and Churchill’s fall from office in July 1945.</p>

Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2013. 1438 pp. </strong>✸ The final biographic volume covers Churchill’s last twenty years, including the opposition period (1945-51), the “Iron Curtain” speech at Fulton, the postwar premiership (1951-55), mixed relations with Truman and Eisenhower, failure of Churchill’s attempts to hold a summit meeting with Stalin’s successors, resignation, retirement and death, seventy years almost to the hour of his father’s death in 1895.</p>

Here Randolph Churchill begins his collection of Companion Volumes, publishing all the main documents relating to Volume I on Churchill’s youth. Where an extract appeared in the Main Volume, the complete document appears here. Where space prevented the inclusion of a contemporary letter, it is included here. Rarely if ever has such a collection been preserved; rarely has such a collection been made available to public scrutiny.</p>

The manner in which Churchill’s restless mind was made up on all the great questions of the day is plainly spelt out in his correspondence&#8230;.many other interests also assert themselves: books, travels, courtship, marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>Winston S.

The context in which he was putting forward his opinions, and the part played by colleagues and opponents in influencing policy, are illustrated throughout by other people’s writings.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>Winston S.

Significant in this period was Churchill’s role in the making of the modern Middle East and his part in the Irish Treaty. Churchill’s personal life underwent many sadnesses, including the death in action of friends, the death of his mother and of his youngest daughter, and a growing personal awareness of the strong forces of disruption and chaos with which the 20th century was being threatened.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>Winston S. Churchill: Companion Volume V, Part 1: Documents, The Exchequer Years 1922-1929.</em> London: Heinemann; Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1981, 1504 pp. <em>The Churchill Documents, vol. 11, The Exchequer Years, 1922-1929</em>. Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2009, 1504 pp. </strong>✸ The massive companions to Volume V were the first to appear individually, rather than in sets of two or three. As with past companion or document volumes, they support the main volume with papers relating to the material covered. This volume involves Churchill’s two years out of office 1922-24, and his return to the Conservatives as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Baldwin Government of 1924-29.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>Winston S. Churchill: Companion Volume V: Part 2: Documents, The Wilderness Years 1929-1935</em>. London: Heinemann; Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1981, 1404 pp. <em>The Churchill Documents, vol. 12, The Wilderness Years, 1929-1935</em>. Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2009. </strong>✸ Documents herein testify to Churchill’s growing conflict with his party leaders over the India Bill, his departure from Baldwin’s Shadow Cabinet, his lecture tours of America, financial problems following the stock market crash, and his amazing literary output, led by the massive biography of his ancestor, John Churchill, First Duke of Marlborough. His growing awareness of the Nazi threat is strongly evident.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>Winston S. Churchill: Companion Volume V: Part 3: Documents, The Coming of War 1936-1939</em>. London: Heinemann, 1982; Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1983, 1844 pp. <em>The Churchill Documents, vol. 13, The Coming of War, 1936-1939</em>. Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2009, 1844 pp. </strong>✸ The most important, and until Hillsdale’s editions the hardest to find, volume of documents published to date, the work is concerned mainly with Churchill’s urgent warnings about Hitler and admonitions for Britain to rearm, his hopes for return to office, and his frustration with the reluctance of his colleagues to accept either him or his arguments. Included are key documents tracing Churchill’s sources of information about the state of German war preparations and, finally, his return to the Admiralty as First Lord as war is declared in September 1939.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>The Churchill War Papers, vol. 1, At the Admiralty September 1939-May 1940.</em> London: Heinemann; New York: W. W.

Documents cover Churchill’s recall to the government as First Lord of the Admiralty at the outbreak of war in 1939; his failed attempts to take the offensive; the failed British attempt to stop the Nazi invasion of Norway; and the fall of the Chamberlain government. Gilbert examines Churchill’s second stewardship of the Admiralty in unprecedented detail, through his writings and those of others.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>The Churchill War Papers, vol. 2, Never Surrender May 1940-December 1940.</em> London: Heinemann; New York: W. W. Norton, 1994, 1360 pp. <em>The Churchill Documents, vol. 15, Never Surrender, May 1940-December 1940. </em>Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2011, 1360 pp. </strong>✸ Churchill’s burdens from the moment he became Prime Minister were daunting. The German juggernaut swept across the Low Countries and France, which fell one by one; the British Army and thousands of French were rescued at Dunkirk, but arrived in England almost unarmed; the Battle of Britain raged in the sky and the Blitz ravaged English cities. Reading these key documents, one reviewer wrote, “is like peering over Churchill’s burly shoulder” as the most frightening and decisive months of the 20th century unfold.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>The Churchill War Papers, vol. 3, The Ever-Widening War 1941. </em>London: Heinemann; New York: W. W.

<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>The Churchill Documents, vol. 17, Testing Times, 1942</em>. Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2013, 1652 pp. </strong>✸ This volume, the first extension of the document series in thirteen years, covers the year 1942, which Churchill in his war memoirs referred to as “the Hinge of Fate.” The war could still go either way, but the Grand Alliance, hitherto engulfed in a storm of military failure, began to see signs of future success and ultimate victory against the Axis powers. By year’s end, the Soviets had defeated the Germans at Stalingrad, the Allies had gained a key victory in Africa at El Alamein, and Churchill was politically secure.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin and Arnn, Larry P., eds. <em>The Churchill Documents, vol. 18, One Continent Redeemed, January-August 1943.</em> Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2015, 2200 pp.</strong> ✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/the-churchill-documents-volume-18-by-sir-martin-gilbert-and-larry-p-arnn/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The United States is thoroughly engaged in the war and the Allies have landed in North Africa after an acrimonious debate, but the campaign there is far from won. The Soviets might still desert the cause if the Anglo-Americans do not invade mainland Europe in 1943, or so Churchill and Roosevelt think. The French exiles under de Gaulle are impossible to deal with, but the old Vichy generals and admirals are probably worse. The great week to ten-day conferences—in this volume alone, at Casablanca, Washington, and Quebec—to settle the future course of the war must be prepared, staffed, conducted and followed up. Churchill’s 69-year-old body is showing the strain of it all. —Eliot A. Cohen</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin and Arnn, Larry P., eds. <em>The Churchill Documents, Vol. 19, Fateful Questions, September 1943-April 1944. </em>Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2017, 2728 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/fateful-questions-churchill-documents/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: <em>Fateful Questions</em> is more than documentation. It is a story. Offered here are the thoughts of men and women who were living in those history-making days. It is well to remember that when these words were spoken, written or dictated—sometimes late at night in the comforting privacy of a diary—they did not know how it all would turn out. Only recently they had faced the prospect of imminent extinction—an existential threat to everything they held dear. By 1943-44, although a sense of confidence was building, the end was far from assured. The logistics of victory were an appalling challenge and burden. —Dave Turrell</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin and Arnn, Larry P., eds. <em>The Churchill Documents, Vol. 20, Normandy and Beyond, May-December 1944</em>. Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2018, 2576 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-documents-volume-20/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Despite its monumental length, there is scarcely a page at which the reader will not stand in awe at Churchill’s linguistic fluidity, clarity of thought and expression, sense of humour, foresight, sheer bloody-mindedness or capacity for impish mischief. Running through the entire length of the work is also a cold hatred of Hitler and the Nazis. When <em>Normandy and Beyond</em> ends in December 1944, the Germans have just been stopped from breaking through to the River Meuse, as the Battle of the Bulge turns in the Allies’ favour. —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin and Arnn, Larry P., eds. <em>The Churchill Documents, Vol. 21, The Shadows of Victory, January-July 1945.</em> Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2018, 2150 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/shadows-victory/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>. During these seven months, Churchill travelled 10,000 miles, wrote more than 1400 pieces of correspondence, and delivered more than two dozen speeches. He attended the Yalta Conference with Stalin and Roosevelt, and he then dealt with the political ramifications of the latter’s death. He saw the defeat of Nazi Germany and the drawing shut of the Iron Curtain. He met with Stalin and Truman at Potsdam, but returned to England before the conference’s end following his loss in the July 5 General Election to Labour candidate Clement Attlee. These stories are known and preserved by Churchill’s letters, telegrams, minutes, and speeches. This volume contains that record.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin and Arnn, Larry P., eds. <em>The Churchill Documents, Vol. 22, Leader of the Opposition, August 1945-September 1951</em>. Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 2019, 2328 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-documents-vol22-opposition/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: “What a wonderful thing it is, looking back, to see all we have survived. All the follies that England commits in time of peace did not prevent her true greatness from shining forth in the hour of need.” This is one among several hundred letters that appear in this stupendous compendium of every major document between the 1945 election and Churchill’s return to the premiership in October 1951. It is a vital part of his career. It encompassed the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan and her subsequent surrender, his Iron Curtain speech in Missouri, the partition of India and the creation of Israel, the Berlin airlift, and the founding of NATO and the European movement. Upon all of these, Churchill took important stances. —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin and Arnn, Larry P., eds. <em>The Churchill Documents, Vol. 23, Never Flinch, Never Weary, October 1951-January 1965.</em> Hillsdale, Mich., Hillsdale College Press, 2019, 2488 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/documents-vol23-never-flinch/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: This final volume covers the advent of the Cold War, Britain’s relations with the United States and Europe, the maintenance and dissolution of Empire. Many documents deal with domestic issues and Britain’s economic predicament. The issues of state he dealt with as prime minister frequently intersected with Churchill’s huge social network and private life. Unique among his contemporaries, his politics, economics, social and private life greatly overlapped. They are not easily separated. <em>Never Flinch, Never Weary</em> bears testimony to Churchill’s fertile mind, social inclinations and action-driven personality. —Klaus Larres</p>

<p><strong>Pilpel, Robert. <em>Churchill in America 1895-1961: An Affectionate Portrait.</em> New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; London: New English Library, 1976, 318 pp. </strong>✸ An account of each of Churchill’s sixteen visits to the United States: from 1895, when he arrived in New York en route to Cuba, to 1961, when he passed through New York too ill to see an anxious President Kennedy. Finely written with humor and verve but not without errors.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thompson, R.W. <em>Churchill and Morton: The Quest for Insight in the Correspondence of Major Sir Desmond Morton and the Author</em>. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1976, 224 pp. </strong>✸ The fourth and final Reginald Thompson Churchill critique reveals Thompson’s main source for his <em>Yankee Marlborough</em> and later writings: Desmond Morton, Churchill’s prewar and wartime intelligence collaborator. This is a sad story: Morton became less useful to Churchill as intelligence became more formalized. Churchill paid decreasing attention to him, and Morton never forgave him for it.</p>

<p><strong>Eggleston, George T. <em>Roosevelt, Churchill and the World War II Opposition</em>. Old Greenwich, Conn.: Devin-Adair, 1979, 256 pp. </strong>✸ The author was with Lindbergh on the America First Committee, which opposed U.S. involvement in World War II, and was put on trial after Pearl Harbor. This is an interesting insider’s account, not without humor.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>Winston Churchill</em>. London: Park Lane Press, 1979; London: Marks and Spencer, 1980, 192 pp. Also published in New York and Sydney. </strong>✸ At first glance a potboiler, this book is an important reference with plentiful, accurately captioned illustrations, many in color, including numerous examples of fine Churchill first editions. A must for bibliophiles.</p>

<p><strong>Moore, Robin James. <em>Churchill, Cripps and India 1939-1945</em>. Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1979, 152 pp. </strong>✸ Stafford Cripps was a key Labour member of the Churchill wartime coalition, successively British ambassador to the Soviet Union and Britain’s liaison with India’s Congress Party leaders. This book critically examines his relationships with Churchill and rather unsuccessful overtures with Congress on future Indian independence.</p>
<p><strong>Neilson, Francis. <em>Churchill and Yalta</em>. Brooklyn, N.Y.: Revisionist Press, 1979. “Revisionist Historiography” series. </strong>✸ Second to none in his dislike of Churchill, the author suggests that WSC was solely responsible for all the ills that came out of Yalta.

Frequently Reprints, and revised, first e-book 2011. </strong>✸ Although the topic is his wife, this work cannot be omitted here. A daughter’s book, yet not without critical analysis, still the most authoritative, reliable, accurate and literate life of Lady Churchill, whose husband said of her: “Here firm, though all be drifting.” The first book to read on Clementine; perhaps the only one necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Weidhorn, Manfred. <em>Sir Winston Churchill.</em> Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1979, 174 pp. “Twayne’s English Author” series. </strong>✸ An erudite account of Churchill’s writings by a leading scholar of the canon.</p>

New York: Stein and Day, 1980, 334 pp., several later printings, the last softbound. </strong>✸ This book is not about Churchill’s oratory, but a well-written, potted biography with many quotes and views by Churchill’s contemporaries, not all of them accurately transcribed or cited.</p>

<p><strong>Patterson, Tony. <em>A Seat for Life: Dundee, Scotland</em>. David Winter and Son, 1980, 292 pp. </strong>✸ The only specialized work on Churchill’s political career at Dundee, Scotland, where he held a seat in Parliament from 1908 to 1922, surviving the tumult of the great reform battles, First World War and the postwar recession. A most thorough account of his parliamentary relationship, swept away in the 1922 election. Profusely illustrated with many novel photos.</p>

New York: Wyndham Books, 1981, 288 pp. </strong>✸ Churchill’s best-known private secretary breaks the so-called Inner Circle into categories or areas of association. Colville is biased, scintillating, and sometimes damaging on Churchill’s political and social friends and colleagues from 1939 to 1955. A notable primary source.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>Churchill’s Political Philosophy</em>. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press for the British Academy, 1981, 120 pp. </strong>✸ A rare work based on a lecture by the official biographer, this book uniquely captures Churchill’s attitudes toward politics and government. His overriding doctrine, Gilbert says, can be summarized in a sentence: “His quarrel was with tyranny.”</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>Churchill: The Wilderness Years</em>. London: Macmillan, 1981; Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1982, 280 pp. </strong>✸ Nicely written and illustrated by the official biographer to go with the television documentary of this name, ably condensing Gilbert’s research on this subject from the official biography, volume 5.</p>
<p><strong>Jaffa, Harry V., ed. <em>Statesmanship: Essays in Honor of Sir Winston Spencer Churchill</em>. Durham, N.C.: Carolina Academic Press, 1982, 280 pp. </strong>✸ Sixteen essays from leading conservative thinkers, notable for Jaffa’s demolition of the myth that Churchill engineered the sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em>. The book concludes that Churchill’s conservative ideas were spurned and his long-term advice unheeded. <em>Contributors</em>: Angelo Codevilla: “De Gaulle: Statesmanship in the Modern State.” Kirk Emmert: “Winston S. Churchill on Civilizing Empire.” Edward J. Erler: “Solzhenitsyn.” Martin Gilbert: “In Search of Churchill’s Character.” Harry V.

<p><strong>Kersaudy, François<em>. Churchill and De Gaulle.</em> London: Collins; New York: Atheneum, 1981, 476 pp. Revised and updated, 1990. Translations: Chinese, Czech, French, Spanish. </strong>✸ For many years the leading work on the subject, this well-balanced work is a thoughtful examination of a complex relation, very worth reading. A mini-furor occurred later, when newly released documents showed Churchill was willing to write off de Gaulle as an ally if necessary to placate Roosevelt, but Kersaudy made that clear long ago in his book.</p>

Should be read with Thompson’s <em>Generalissimo Churchill</em>. Not often seen, worth seeking out.</p>
<p><strong>Seldon, Anthony. <em>Churchill’s Indian Summer: The Conservative Government, 1951-1955</em>. London: Hodder and Stoughton. 1981, Reprints. </strong>✸ A standard work on Churchill’s 1951-55 Conservative Government distinguished by numerous first-person interviews.</p>

Wallin maintains that the concept was strategically sound and would have worked—that ruination came because Churchill lacked the plenary authority to control events.</p>

Churchill: The Rise to Failure 1874-1915.</em> London: Jonathan Cape, 1983. </strong>✸ An exciting and learned work on the period, especially thorough on the Dardanelles attack, which cost Churchill the Admiralty. Handsomely bound with illustrated map endpapers. Although Morgan projected two more volumes, he was unable to convince his publisher to accept them; a shame, because this is a well-written, balanced and deftly argued work.</p>

<p><strong>Manchester, William. <em>The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill</em>, vol. 1: <em>Visions of Glory 1874-1932. </em>Boston and Toronto: Little Brown, 1983, 974 pp. <em>Churchill: The Last Lion</em>. London: Michael Joseph. Translations: Italian, French. Many editions since. </strong>✸ Manchester’s lyrical biography makes for fabulous reading; the prologue accurately captures the vanished world into which Churchill was born better than any other work. Given short shrift by academics, the author was accused of hagiography (though he is sometimes quite critical), purple prose and mistakes large and small. Manchester has nonetheless brought more people to Churchill than any writer save Martin Gilbert.</p>
<p><strong>__________. <em>The Last Lion: William Spencer Churchill</em>, vol. 2: <em>Alone 1932-1940</em>. Boston and Toronto: Little Brown, 1988, 756 pp. <em>Churchill: The Caged Lion</em>. London: Michael Joseph, 1988; Translations: Italian, French. Many editions since. </strong>✸ In a powerful polemic, Manchester takes Churchill’s part as Germany arms and the statesman’s message goes unheeded. Excoriating the “Men of Munich,” the author nevertheless comes close to accusing Churchill of racism over India. The prologue, “Chartwell, 1932,” is a time capsule which takes the reader as close as possible to what life there must have been like.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester, William and Reid, Paul <em>The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill</em>, vol. 3: <em>Defender of the Realm 1940-1965</em>. Boston and Toronto: Little Brown, 2012, 1232 pp. </strong>✸ The long-awaited finale to Manchester’s trilogy, completed by the author’s friend Paul Reid, who writes well. The book was criticized for “historical isolationism”: failure to consult the vast body of history published since Manchester’s volume 2 in 1988, and for rushing through the post-1945 years (a period Manchester had intended to omit). “Paul Reid has not written a biography, but rather an old-style ‘life and times’ narrative with guns and bullets, political conniving, oft-repeated (but worth repeating) anecdotes, lovely touches of the personal, and the most important asset—a hero. It is a nice cruise down a rather lengthy river that you’ve sailed before. There is nothing new or exciting; it is reassuring rather than challenging. Still, it is a lovely and literate view of familiar territory that massages old stories, nurtures legends and points gently to miscalculations and mistakes of the hero—who flawed though he was, remains a hero.” —Warren F. Kimball</p>
<p><strong>Pelaprat and Dupuis. <em>Les Ailes du Lion: Churchill [The Wings of the Lion].</em> Lausanne and Paris: Dargaud, 1983, 64 pp., text in French. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Prior, Robin. <em>Churchill’s “World Crisis” as History</em>. London and Canberra: Croom Helm, 1983, 394 pp. </strong>✸ An Australian author argues that Churchill’s <em>The World Crisis</em> was at least a partial distortion of facts, omitting opposing views to justify Churchill’s own positions. While this renders it “a flawed work,” Prior concludes, “genuine efforts were made by Churchill to take a more detached view [and] it raised the whole intellectual level of the discussion [with] a thread of humanity and breadth of vision which together with the power of the writing will ensure it remains one of the classic accounts of the war.”</p>
<p><strong>Thompson, Kenneth W. <em>Winston Churchill’s World View: Statesmanship and Power.</em> Baton Rouge, La.: Louisiana State University Press, 1983, 364 pp.; softbound, 1987. </strong>✸ A study of Churchill’s underlying principles and goals behind his concepts of power, politics and diplomacy, collective security and practical morality, demonstrating the relevance of his views to modern times.</p>
<p><strong>Venkataramani, M.S. and Shrivastara, B.K. <em>Roosevelt, Gandhi, Churchill: America and the Last Phase of India’s Freedom Struggle.</em> New Delhi, India: Radiant Publishers, 1983, 492 pp. </strong>✸ A nasty polemic. The thesis is that Roosevelt gave only lip service to Indian independence, while Churchill took advantage of FDR’s lukewarm advocacy. On Indian independence there are things to criticize both in Roosevelt’s hypocrisy and in Churchill’s earlier concepts of empire. But Hitler had worse things in mind for India, Gandhi ended life favorably disposed toward Churchill, and there are more balanced critiques than this one.</p>

Reissued as <em>Winston Churchill: A Biography</em>, 2001. Translations: German. </strong>✸ A miniature portrait with ample criticism by a former Keeper of the Churchill Archives, Cambridge. Brendon represents the revisionist case on a number of issues, particularly Churchill’s conduct of military strategy. It is news to learn that Churchill’s greatest single contribution to the Second World War was his oratory. Among numerous examples of the “demigod’s” failure is the despatch of tanks to North Africa [where the author says] “Churchill had not ensured proper testing.” The Premier must also be a mechanic. —H. Ashley Redburn</p>
<p><strong>Callahan, Raymond. <em>Churchill: Retreat from Empire.</em> Wilmington, Del.: Scholarly Resources; London: Costello, 1984, 294 pp. </strong>✸ The author sets out to explain how, contrary to his wishes, Churchill did end up presiding over the dissolution of the British Empire. But the book is also a review of his entire career, with emphasis on the two World Wars.</p>

A scholarly but highly debatable work, truly uncompromising in its negative view of Churchill. The book offers a wealth of detail and analysis with some thought-provoking arguments and scores a few hits.

Translations: German, Japanese, Spanish. </strong>✸ One of the most important primary sources, and the most comprehensive of three books by Churchill’s best-known private secretary (1939-44, 1951-55). Colville came over from Chamberlain’s office, sharing the prevailing doubt over the “half-breed American” who had become prime minister. As the diaries progress, his doubts change to admiration. The biographic sketches in the back are literate, pungent, and withal not what you’ll read in <em>Who’s Who</em>. An invaluable and timeless primary source.</p>

Here an Australian academic offers the unlikely thesis that Prime Minister Menzies, who differed with Churchill over war policy involving Australia in 1941-42, was a serious candidate for prime minister of Great Britain. Well written and interesting, despite the exotic theory.</p>

New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986, 370 pp.; softbound, 1988. </strong>✸ The author argues that Churchill’s hand of friendship to the Soviet Union, extended in 1941, was quickly withdrawn, and his long background as an anticommunist led to the hardening of America’s attitude toward Stalin.</p>

Belfast: Pretani Press, 1986, 412 pp., softbound.</strong> ✸ Four of Britain’s leading World War II generals—Brooke, Auchinleck, Montgomery and Alexander—were Ulstermen.

The Ulster author is certain, writing “of an erratic political genius pitched against the superb craftsmanship of the Irish professional soldier, and of those resultant relationships which affected the destiny of all mankind.”</p>

<p><strong>Campbell, Jeremy. <em>Winston Churchill’s Afternoon Nap: A Wide-Awake Inquiry into the Human Nature of Crime.</em> New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987, 432 pp. Reprints, softbound. </strong>✸ An outrageous use of Churchill’s name to sell a book having nothing to do with him. There is exactly one page referring to WSC’s nap, offering no further elaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>Churchill’s London: Spinning Top of Memories: of Ungrand Places and Moments in Time. </em>Hopkinton, N.H.: Churchill Literary Foundation, 1987, 28 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ Illustrated text of an address to a London dinner of the International Churchill Society. The author discusses Churchill’s homes and other obscure places in London which played key roles in his story, including the onetime London Magazine on the Serpentine, which Churchill had defended when war threatened with Germany in 1911. Churchill’s prompt action helped convince Prime Minister Asquith to name him First Lord of the Admiralty.</p>
<p><strong>Holley, Darrell. <em>Churchill’s Literary Allusions: An Index to the Education of a Soldier, Statesman and Litterateur</em>. Jefferson, N.C. and London: McFarland, 1987, 220 pp. </strong>✸ A unique catalogue of Churchill’s allusions to great literature from the Bible to Shakespeare and Macaulay in his writings and speeches, cross indexed by key words, including “unknown allusions.”</p>
<p><strong>Irving, David. <em>Churchill’s War,</em> vol. 1: <em>The Struggle for Power</em>. Bullsbrook, Australia: Veritas, 666 pp.; London: Arrow Books, 1987. Reprints. </strong>✸ A highly critical polemic regarded as without much credibility. Denounced by one reviewer as “a farrago of crappola,” yet filled with fascinating if dubious footnotes that can be found nowhere else, like “Mrs. Goering to the author.” Everyone is entitled to be heard.</p>
<p><strong>__________. <em>Churchill’s War,</em> vol. 2, <em>Triumph in Adversity.</em> London: Focal Point Publishing Ltd., 2001, 1064 pp. </strong>✸ Prior to publication, the author took up one of his themes, Churchill’s alleged cowardice during the London Blitz: “When he knew that London was going to cop it, he hopped into his Daimler and had himself driven out to Dytchley [<em>sic</em>] in Oxfordshire, for the night.” This was contradicted by everyone who spent time with Churchill: he went to Ditchley only seven times, not to avoid London but to avoid Chequers (official country house of prime ministers), which could be easily spotted from the air on moonlit nights. Luftwaffe raids over London were more numerous, and when they were expected, Churchill insisted on staying there. This vignette summarizes the kind of reporting contained herein.</p>
<p><strong>Murray, Edmund. <em>I Was Churchill’s Bodyguard.</em> London: W. Allen, 1987, 302 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ Though autobiographical, most of this book by the late Churchill bodyguard covers his years as Churchill’s detective, 1950-65. Murray writes sensitively with much inside information, and insights to Churchill’s painting as a fellow artist. Includes some unique photographs.</p>

<p><strong>Smith, Ronald A. <em>Churchill: Images of Greatness</em>.

The well-researched book proceeds chronologically rather than grouping the items by type, thus is difficult as a ready reference. Though its brief biography contains many errors, it is accurate and authoritative when it comes to describing the items, though the prices quoted may be out of date.</p>

Between Churchill and Stalin: The Soviet Union, Great Britain and the Origins of the Grand Alliance.</em> Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1988, 320 pp. </strong>✸ This scholarly work looks at Churchill’s refusal to recognize Soviet takeover of the Baltic States in 1941-43, how his Cabinet prevailed on him not to interfere with Stalin’s plans, and how that in turn only whetted Soviet appetites. A fresh analysis that is restorative rather than revisionist.</p>

This work provides one of the few studies of Churchill’s 1950s ministry, covering the Soviet Union, Korea, relations with the USA, and events leading up to the 1956 Suez Crisis. A work that may offer more insight than either on this period is Leaming, <em>Churchill Defiant</em> (2010).</p>
<h3><strong>1989</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Birkenhead, The Earl of. <em>Churchill 1874-1922</em>. London: Harrap Books, 1989, 552 pp. Reprints. Introduction by Sir John Colville. </strong>✸ An epic volume by Freddie Birkenhead, son of Churchill’s best friend, F.E. Smith, First Lord Birkenhead. Not a hagiography, this is one of the best single-volume works, lyrically written with a soaring climax and a brilliant coda. Unfortunately the author died before he was able to finish a projected two-volume work. (See next entry.)</p>
<p><strong>__________. <em>Churchill 1924-1940</em>. Bath, England: privately published by the Countess of Birkenhead, 1989, 216 pp. </strong>✸ Because of his special knowledge, Freddie Birkenhead was to have contributed two biographic volumes on Churchill, keeping pace with Martin Gilbert’s official biography. His death prevented him writing beyond 1922, and the task was taken up by his son Robin, who had progressed to 1940 when he suddenly died aged only 47, in 1985. Robin’s mother arranged for this private publication of all Robin had written. It “has neither a beginning nor an end; nor did he have his father’s advantage of personal knowledge&#8230;.It is only a first draft&#8230;.his friend will agree it would be wrong to let it languish in the file, unset and unseen.” Not in the class of his father’s work, it nevertheless completes the task the Birkenhead family set itself.</p>
<p><strong>Cannadine, David, ed. <em>Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat: The Speeches of Winston Churchill.</em> Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1989, 356 pp.; London: Cassell, 1990. </strong>✸ Collects some of Churchill’s best speeches, combined with connecting commentary, often waspish. Churchill’s speeches reveal “a man completely self-absorbed and egotistically uninterested in the opinions of anyone else.” (But included are three famous Churchill appreciations of Lloyd George, Chamberlain and Roosevelt.) The speeches were “ultimately ineffective” in that they did not achieve their objective, “his supreme ambition of becoming prime minister.” How many of his speeches had the Premiership as their objective? Readable for the speeches, if not the interpretations.</p>

<p><strong>Emmert, Kirk. <em>Winston S. Churchill on Empire</em>. Durham, N.C.: Carolina Academic Press, 1989, 158 pp. </strong>✸ Produced in association with the Claremont Institute for the Study of Statesmanship and Political Philosophy. The author takes a sympathetic view of Churchill’s attachment to what Emmert considers a “civilizing empire,” claiming that its object was needed to prepare subject peoples for responsible nationhood.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin, ed. <em>The Chartwell Bulletins, January-June 1935</em>. Hopkinton, N.H.: International Churchill Society, 1989, 64 pp. softbound; 25 hardbound in leather. </strong>✸ First publication in volume form of the letters Churchill wrote his wife about politics and life in Chartwell while she was voyaging to the South Seas in 1935. From his septic tank backing up, to the Nazi threat to Europe; from his son’s political gaffes to the latest machinations in Parliament, Churchill shares every detail of his life at Chartwell with his absent wife. The letters, never intended for publication, add greatly to our understanding. Sir Martin provides detailed footnotes on people and places mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>Grant, R.G. <em>Winston Churchill</em>. London: W.H. Smith; New York: Gallery Books, 1989, 224 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ An artistic potted biography with much new illustrated material along with absorbing historic photographs and artwork, many in color.

<p><strong>Blake, Robert. <em>Winston Churchill as Historian</em>. Austin, Tex.: College of Liberal Arts, Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas, 1990, 16 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ This short outline offers just a taste of what one can learn from Ashley’s pathfinding <em>Churchill as Historian</em> (1968) and the David Reynolds’ comprehensive <em>In Command of History: Churchill Fighting and Writing the Second World War</em> (2004).</p>
<p><strong>Boyle, Peter G., ed. <em>The Churchill-Eisenhower Correspondence 1953-1955</em>. Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1990, 230 pp. </strong>✸ A compilation of the fairly limited correspondence between the two leaders after Eisenhower became President. There are few revelations, though the correspondence is fascinating. Some of Eisenhower’s letters to the aging Churchill in the 1950s, probably written by State Department hands, proclaiming the end of empire and refusal to consider any accommodation with the Russians, are almost painful to read. This work demonstrates the divergence of opinion between Churchill and Eisenhower over the possibility of a change in Soviet attitudes after the death of Stalin.</p>

<p><strong>Jablonsky, David. <em>Churchill, the Great Game and Total War.</em> London: Frank Cass, 1990, 240 pp.; Portland, Ore.: Frank Cass/International Book Services, 1991. </strong>✸ In this thorough and well-written work, the author provides insight into the use of espionage and the involvement of entire populations in the wars of the 20th century. Churchill, he says, was influenced by his Victorian upbringing.</p>
<p><strong>__________. <em>Churchill: The Making of a Grand Strategist</em>. Carlisle, Penna.: Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College, 1990, 96 pp. </strong>✸ Jablonsky fuses the relationship between strategy and the life of Churchill into a valuable monograph with a clear explanation of the multidimensional nature of 20th century warfare. This essay is also reprinted in the author’s <em>Churchill and Hitler</em> (1994).</p>
<p><strong>Lukacs, John. <em>The Duel: Hitler vs. Churchill, 10 May-31 July 1940</em>. London: The Bodley Head; Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1990, 276 pp. Numerous reprints. Translations: Danish, Dutch, French, Hungarian, German, Portuguese, Swedish, Japanese. </strong>✸ Starting with the not altogether novel idea that the first two and a half months of World War II’s active phase were a personal duel between Churchill and Hitler, the author states that the whole course of the war was decided during those eighty days. Paramount, Lukacs says, was the “duel of minds” between the two antagonists.</p>
<p><strong>Martin, David. <em>The Web of Disinformation: Churchill’s Yugoslav Blunder</em>.

Each medal is depicted and its background described; major orders are depicted in color. The author provides a chronology of the times and a medallic history of Great Britain from Queen Victoria’s little wars through World War II.</p>
<p><strong>Soames, Mary. <em>Winston Churchill: His Life as a Painter</em>. London: Collins, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1990, 224 pp. </strong>✸ Accompanied by excellent large-scale color plates, Churchill’s daughter provides a sense of what her father’s personal life was like as she weaves his hobby of painting into his years as a statesman, husband and father. Well written and researched; a good book to read alongside the painting books by David Coombs and Minnie Churchill.</p>
<p><strong>Thompson, K.W. <em>Foreign Policy and Arms Control: Churchill’s Legacy</em>. Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1990, 142 pp. </strong>✸ A positive account of Churchill’s contribution to modern concepts of peacekeeping and arms control.</p>
<p><strong>Thurgood, Mervyn F. <em>That Bastard Churchill. </em>Surrey, B.C.: self-published, 1990, 28 pp. softbound. ✸  </strong>&#8220;A scathing indictment of Churchill&#8217;s personality and policies.

Norton, 1991, 608 pp.; softbound, 1992; also published in German. </strong>✸ A well-documented history explaining the war through the personalities and activities of Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin.

<p><strong>Franz-Willing, George. <em>Roosevelt, er wollte den grossen Krieg: Churchill, Verteidiger und Zerstörer des Empires [Roosevelt, He Wanted the Great War: Churchill, Defender and Destroyer of Empires].</em> Rosenheim: Deutsche Verlagsgesellschaft, 1991, text in German. </strong>✸ The approach is clear from the title.</p>
<p><strong>Fromkin, David. <em>A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East 1914-1922. </em>London: Deutsch; New York: Holt, 1991, 636 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Not in Zoller’s original catalogue, this is as much a work about Churchill than any here, examining as it does the inside story of his wartime encounters with Turkey and his chairing the 1921 Cairo Conference. Despite its age, it remains a standard on the latter subject.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>Churchill: A Life</em>. London: Heinemann, New York: Holt, 1991, 1066 pp. Many reprints. Translations: Italian. </strong>✸ Not an abridgement, but a ground-up biography including much information not known when the original volumes were written, especially the early ones. An important and vital work that must be consulted for information not contained in the early volumes of the official biography.</p>
<p><strong>Golland, Jim. <em>Not Winston, Just William? Winston Churchill at Harrow</em>. Harrow, Middx.: The Herga Press, 1991, 40 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ The author, a Harrow teacher, delves into school archives to show that Churchill’s schoolboy failings were greatly magnified, by himself and by biographers who accepted what Churchill wrote. In fact, he was a particularly good student in several areas, and even wrote an essay accurately predicting some of the events of World War I.</p>
<p><strong>Harmon, Christopher C. <em>“Are We Beasts?” Churchill on the Moral Question of World War II “Area Bombing.”</em> Newport, R.I.: Naval War College, 1991, 34 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ Making effective use of published sources, Harmon concludes that bombing Germany would have been less troubling after the war had British political and military elites ceased doing it as soon as their superior power permitted. This is perhaps much easier to judge in hindsight. The author shows that Churchill, far from glorying in the bombing campaign, had deep regrets over it and several times questioned its necessity.</p>
<p><strong>Humes, James C. <em>The Sir Winston Method: The Five Secrets of Speaking the Language of Leadership.</em> New York: William Morrow, 1991, 190 pp., hardbound and softbound. </strong>✸ Humes’s best book about Churchill. The author, a former presidential speechwriter, offers a how-to manual discussing Churchill’s oratorical precepts: begin strongly, focus on one theme, use simple language, draw a picture in the listener’s mind, and end with emotion.</p>
<p><strong>Jefferys, Kevin. <em>The Churchill Coalition and Wartime Politics 1940-1945</em>. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 1991, 242 pp. </strong>✸ Although Labour, Liberal and Conservative members of the wartime coalition were of one mind on winning the war, their domestic differences were never entirely absent, and always kept in mind, most successfully by Labour.</p>
<p><strong>Keegan, John. <em>Churchill’s Generals</em>. New York and London: Weidenfeld, 1991, 368 pp. Numerous reprints. </strong>✸ An outstanding review of Churchill’s relationships with his military chiefs by the defense correspondent of <em>The Times</em> (London). Highly recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Lamb, Richard. <em>Churchill as War Leader: Right or Wrong?</em> London: Bloomsbury Publishing, New York: Carroll and Graff, 1991, 400 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ The author sets out to exonerate Churchill from many popular condemnations, such as the failure of the Dieppe Raid, the bombing of Coventry and the attack on Pearl Harbor. His book was criticized for inadequate research in some areas, such as Churchill’s relations with Tito and failing to differentiate between broad concepts and specific actions. Nevertheless, this is an interesting and readable account which casts Churchill’s actions in a fresh light.</p>
<p><strong>Martin, John. </strong><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large"><strong><em>Downing Street: The War Years &#8211; Diaries, Letters and a Memoir</em>. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 1991, 224 pp. Reprints.</strong> ✸ Martin served as a private secretary during the Second World War. His diary-memoir is not as deep, long or insightful as John Colville&#8217;s <em>Fringes of Power,</em> but is important as another insider&#8217;s view of the wartime government.</span></p>
<p><strong>Robert K. Massie. <em>Dreadnought: Britain, Germany and the Coming of the Great War. </em>New York: Random House, 1991. Hardbound. 908 pp. </strong>✸ A Pulitzer winner weaves a powerful narrative history of the pre-1914 Anglo-German naval arms race intertwined with brilliant biographical vignettes of the major players, especially Churchill. Neither adulatory nor overcritical; an insightful examination of WSC’s central role in this military melodrama. —WJS</p>

New York: Simon and Schuster. <em>The Churchills.</em> Markham, Ont.: Penguin. Translations: Spanish, Swedish. </strong>✸ The author purports to explain why Churchill’s children, except for Mary, turned out so “bad,” but this is a vitriolic, one-sided piece of research and an example of the depths to which Churchill phobia can sink, full of misquotes and excerpts out of context. It cannot be taken seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Rusbridger, James and Nave, Eric. <em>Betrayal at Pearl Harbor: How Churchill Lured Roosevelt into World War II. </em>London: Summit Books, 1991, 302 pp. Translations: French. </strong>✸ A conspiracy theory suggesting that Churchill knew in advance about the Pearl Harbor attack and let it happen to draw America into war. This is a longstanding myth that has never survived serious research.</p>
<p><strong>Smith, Gregory Bell. <em>The American Ancestry of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill</em>. New York: Self-published, 2014, 192 pp.</strong> ✸ A detailed genealogy of Churchill’s American mother Jennie Jerome’s forebears in colonial America and the United States.</p>

<h3><strong>1992</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Addison, Paul. <em>Churchill on the Home Front 1900-1955</em>. London: Jonathan Cape, 1992, 494 pp. Several reprints. </strong>✸ A classic work on Churchill’s domestic policies, elections and politics, covering everything from his entry into Parliament in 1901 to his last term as Prime Minister, which ended in 1955. The author is evenhanded, and has documented his work with a plethora of sources. “A tour de force.” <em>—Kirkus Reviews.</em> This work won the Farrow Award for excellence in Churchill Studies. Strongly recommended for the essential Churchill library.</p>
<p><strong>Alldritt, Keith. <em>Churchill the Writer: His Life as Man of Letters</em>. London: Hutchinson, Random Century Group, 1992, 168 pp. </strong>✸ Written to recount “the career of a professional writer,” this book had mixed reviews. Some put it among the best on Churchill’s literary career, others considered it light and frothy, offering nothing new. Should be read alongside similar works by Weidhorn, Ashley, Woods, Langworth and Rose.</p>
<p><strong>Ben-Moshe, Tuvia. <em>Churchill: Strategy and History</em>. Boulder, Colo.: Lynne Rienner Publishers; Hemel Hempstead, England: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1992, 396 pp. </strong>✸ An Israeli revisionist argues that Churchill was a habitual believer in backdoor strategies such as the Dardanelles in World War I, Europe’s “soft underbelly” in World War II; that he lacked skill as a strategist; that he deceived his allies and designed his war memoirs to obfuscate his mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Churchill Archives Centre. <em>A Guide to the Holdings of the Churchill College Archive Centre.</em> Cambridge: Churchill Archives Centre, 1992, 48 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ Defined by its title, a comprehensive catalogue of the archives, notably including Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p><strong>Kettle, Michael. <em>Churchill and the Archangel Fiasco November 1918-July 1919</em>. London and New York: Routledge, 1992, 582 pp. </strong>✸ Volume 3 of a projected five-volume work entitled <em>Russia and the Allies 1917-1920</em>. Only two others were published: vol. 1, <em>The Allies and the Russian Collapse, March 1917-March 1918</em> (London: André Deutsch, 1981); and vol. 2, <em>The Road to Intervention, March 1918-November 1918</em> (London and New York: Routledge, 1988).</p>
<p><strong>Langworth, Richard M. and Redburn, H. Ashley. <em>Churchill Bibliographic Data.</em> Hopkinton, N.H.: International Churchill Society, 48 pp., softbound in grey wrappers. </strong>✸ This work collects two sections of the <em>Churchill Handbook</em> (1992), namely “All the Books of Winston S. Churchill” by Richard M. Langworth and “A Bibliography of Works Concerning or Relating to The Rt. Hon. Winston S. Churchill” by H. Ashley Redburn. The latter contains biographies and studies strictly about Churchill. Includes Langworth’s foreword, “The 30 Best Works about Churchill.”</p>
<p><strong>Mayer, Frank A. <em>The Opposition Years: Winston S. Churchill and the Conservative Party, 1945-1951.</em> New York: Peter Lang, 1992, 188 pp. </strong>✸ The author contests the broad conception that Churchill in opposition took little interest in postwar domestic policy, but that he put the people and policies in place to convert the defeated Tories to a modern welfare party, enabling them to regain power. Critics complained that the book was riddled with errors, and gave Churchill too much credit for the transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Mein, Margaret. <em>Winston Churchill and Christian Fellowship</em>. Ilfracombe, Devon: Arthur H. Stockwell, 1992, 60 pp. </strong>✸ A scholarly juxtaposition of Churchill’s and de Gaulle’s speeches with elements of the Anglican Liturgy, this work is designed to explore themes of Christian fellowship and common citizenship. The author mobilizes a vast array of quotes (there are more notes than text); but suggestions regarding Churchill’s spirituality are perhaps overstated and misdirected. One could argue that his religion was a civic one, perhaps even deistic, based upon a rational ideal of Western civilization. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Robbins, Keith. <em>Churchill</em>. London: Longman Group, 1992, 186 pp., several reprints. Translations: Hungarian, Spanish, Swedish. “Profiles in Power” series. </strong>✸ The book aims to show what made Churchill’s “commanding role in national and world affairs” possible. Said to be another “study in failure” (over loss of the Empire), this book praises more than criticizes. Compact, readable and good.</p>
<p><strong>Sutcliffe, J.A., ed. <em>The Sayings of Winston Churchill</em>. London, Duckworth, 1992, 64 pp., softbound. Introduction by Robert Blake. Reissued as a hardback, 2012. </strong>✸ A vest-pocket compilation of quips and quotes, with attributions, on youth, politics, socialism, parliament, contemporaries, war, history, Britain, America, Russia, foreigners, books, painting and himself. Also a section on “repartee.”</p>
<p><strong>Weidhorn, Manfred. <em>Harmony of Interests: Explorations in the Mind of Sir Winston Churchill.</em> Teaneck, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University, London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1992, 192 pp. </strong>✸ Considers Churchill’s political philosophy from six aspects: Polemicist, Conservative, Warhorse, Dreamer, Semi-American and “Great Man?” Is Churchill great because he was great, or because he wrote about his greatness? For those who enjoy Weidhorn’s other books, this is of the same high order.</p>
<p><strong>Woods, Frederick. <em>Artillery of Words: The Writings of Sir Winston Churchill</em>. London: Leo Cooper Pen and Sword Books, 1992, 184 pp. </strong>✸ Not on par with Weidhorn’s <em>Sword and Pen</em> (1974), this is a useful reference to Churchill’s books. Too much is made of the assistants who drafted some of Churchill’s advance manuscripts: after all, nothing was published that Churchill didn’t sign off on, and some drafts were rejected outright.</p>
<h3><strong>1993</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Blake, Robert and Louis, Wm. Roger, eds. <em>Churchill: A Major New Assessment of His Life in Peace and War.</em> New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993, 582 pp. Reprints, softbound. </strong>✸ Twenty-nine essays by mostly well-qualified contributors, notably including Addison, Pelling, Ziegler, Blake, Kimball, Ambrose and Jenkins. Inevitably uneven, the essays sometimes cover new ground or challenge outdated conclusions, but many other chapters reiterate standard arguments based on widely available sources or revisionist theories already deeply plumbed. <em>Contributors</em>: Paul Addison: “Churchill and Social Reform.” Stephen E. Ambrose: “Churchill and Eisenhower in the Second World War.” Max Beloff: “Churchill and Europe.” Robert Blake: “How Churchill Became Prime Minister.” David Cannadine: “Churchill and the Pitfalls of Family Piety.” Michael Carver: “Churchill and the Defence Chiefs.” Peter Clarke: “Churchill’s Economic Ideas 1900-1930.” Gordon A.

Wenden: “Churchill, Radio, and Cinema.” Philip Ziegler: “Churchill and the Monarchy.”</p>
<p><strong>Charmley, John. <em>Churchill: The End of Glory, A Political Biography</em>. Sevenoaks: Hodder and Stoughton, New York: Harcourt Brace, 1993, 742 pp. Reprints </strong>✸ What publicized this work was a section arguing that Churchill should have backed away from fighting Germany in 1940 in order to preserve Britain’s wealth, power and empire. (Charmley did not say “make peace with Hitler,” as some reviewers stated.) Per the author, Churchill chose instead to make Britain a client state of America, allowing Soviet power to wax and the British Empire to wane. Whatever we may think of that argument, this is a well-written, critical biography from a self-described “Thatcherite” historian. The bibliography lists every significant book in English relating to the political Churchill, but is light on foreign works.</p>
<p><strong>Delpla, François. <em>Churchill et les français: six personnages dans la tourmente [Churchill and the French: Six Characters in Turmoil] 1939-1940</em>. Paris: Plon, 1993, 824 pp., text in French. New edition, 2000.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lambakis, Steven James. <em>Winston Churchill, Architect of Peace: A Study of Statesmanship and the Cold War.</em> Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1993, 186 pp. </strong>✸ After World War II, the author says, Churchill was a statesman attempting to achieve the high-minded international and domestic political tasks he had worked so vigilantly to keep alive during the war. The author lays out a frame of reference for understanding Churchill’s aspirations, efforts and accomplishments.</p>
<p><strong>Parish, Michael W. <em>Aegean Adventures 1940-1943 and the End of Churchill’s Dream</em>. Sussex: The Book Guild, 1993, 400 pp. </strong>✸ In this partly autobiographical work, the author says Churchill’s dream was to invade Europe from the southeast before or perhaps instead of the cross-channel invasion. Parish suggests that Churchill was betrayed by his allies, especially Roosevelt, and the result was Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Wu, Chen-i. <em>Chìu-chi-erh Yü Chan Shih Ying-kuo 1939-1945</em>. Taipei, Republic of China: Taiwan shang wu yin shu kuan, 1993, text in Chinese. </strong></p>
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>1994</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Baron, Alexander. <em>The Churchill Papers: Revising the Revisionist, Unmasking Irving</em>. London: Infotex, 1994, 150 pp. </strong>✸ A critique of the revisionist writer David Irving and his book <em>Churchill’s War</em> (1987).</p>
<p><strong>Costello, John. <em>Day of Infamy: MacArthur, Roosevelt, Churchill, the Shocking Truth Revealed.</em> New York: Pocket Books, 1994, 448 pp. Reprints, softbound. </strong>✸ Another in the line of conspiracy notions unproven by facts: the cabal of Churchill and Roosevelt brought about Pearl Harbor, while MacArthur lost the Philippines and won the Medal of Honor.</p>
<p><strong>David, Saul. <em>Churchill’s Sacrifice of the Highland Division: France 1940</em>. London, Washington: Brassey’s, 1994, 276 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ In this history of the 51st (Highland) Division in France in 1939-1940, the author concludes that Churchill “needed to sacrifice” the Division to provide a concrete example of Britain’s determination to stand by France to the end.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>In Search of Churchill: A Historian’s Journey.</em> London: HarperCollins, 338 pp. New York: John Wiley, 1994, 416 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ The official biographer’s fascinating adventures and interviews in the process of compiling the official biography. This is also Gilbert’s answer to critics over the years who accused him of being uncritical about a man others have spent years denouncing. Having examined more evidence than anyone in writing the official biography, Gilbert states that he came away even more impressed with Churchill’s intellect, generosity, statesmanship and humanity. Cited by many as the best Churchill book of 1994. Especially useful to the scholar interested in primary source material.</p>
<p><strong>Humes, James C., ed. <em>The Wit and Wisdom of Winston Churchill.</em> New York: Harper, 1994, 234 pp., “Harper Perennial.” Reprints, softbound. Foreword by Richard M. Nixon. </strong>✸ Interesting chapters entitled “Orations and Opinions,” “Coiner of Phrases,” “Saints and Sinners,” “Escapades and Encounters,” with appendices on milestones in Churchill’s life and his writings. Unfortunately, the quotes are not attributed, and quite a few are either apocryphal or inaccurate.</p>
<p><strong>Jablonsky, David, ed. <em>Churchill and Hitler: Selected Essays on the Political-Military Direction of Total War.</em> Ilford, Essex and Portland, Ore.: Frank Cass, 1994, 328 pp. </strong>✸ A mildly revisionist and somewhat technocratic presentation analyzes aspects of the style, thought and actions of Churchill and Hitler as they apply to the direction of total war. Jablonsky presents a thoughtful, persuasive and well-written examination of the leadership abilities that made Churchill a hero and Hitler a villain. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Kilzer, Louis C. <em>Churchill’s Deception: The Dark Secret That Destroyed Nazi Germany</em>. New York and London: Simon and Schuster, 1994, 336 pp. </strong>✸ The author argues that Churchill tricked Hitler into attacking the Soviet Union, a deception that led to the deaths of 20 million Russians, unleashed the Holocaust and resulted in the Cold War. The author should have read <em>Mein Kampf</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Lace, William W. <em>The Importance of Winston Churchill</em>. San Diego: Lucent Books, 1994, 128 pp. In the “Importance of” series. </strong>✸ Juvenile.</p>
<p><strong>Lawlor, Sheila. <em>Churchill and the Politics of War 1940-1941.</em> Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994, 270 pp., softbound and a limited number hardbound. </strong>✸ Analyzes conflicting views and reactions to events among Britain’s leaders. Lawlor consults diaries and private letters to show how Chamberlain joined Churchill in concluding there was no compromise with Hitler after the fall of France, while Halifax leaned toward a negotiated settlement. Her book demonstrates that latter-day hindsight is no substitute for primary source material recorded at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Marshall, John David. <em>In Pursuit of a Ticket for Churchill’s Fulton Speech: The Story Behind Ticket 1476</em>. Murfreesboro, Tenn.: Chartwell South Press, 1994, 20 pp., softbound. Limited to “about 101 copies.” </strong>✸ In a self-published monograph, the author tells how, as a high school student in 1946, he gained admission to hear Churchill’s “Sinews of Peace” speech at Westminster College, Fulton, Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>Ponting, Clive<em>. Churchill. </em>London: Sinclair-Stevenson, 1994, 900 pp. Reprints, softbound. </strong>✸ A compendium of vitriol which is hard to beat for twisted facts and out-of-context quotes, sorely lacking in scholarship. A leading example of what William Manchester called “generational chauvinism”: condemning figures of the past for failing to measure up to the moral standards, such as they are, of the present. Recommended for the library that must have everything.</p>
<p><strong>Riott, Pat. <em>The Greatest Story Never Told: Winston Churchill and the Crash of 1929</em>. Oak Brook, Ill.: Nanoman Press, 1994, 216 pp. </strong>✸ This must be the most bizarre conspiracy theory: Churchill helped cause the Wall Street debacle that wiped him out financially.</p>
<p><strong>Roberts, Andrew. <em>Eminent Churchillians. </em>London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1994; New York: Simon and Schuster, 1995, 354 pp. </strong>✸ Patterned after Lytton Strachey’s <em>Eminent Victorians</em>, and equally literate. While not in Zoller’s original Section A, this is an important book about Churchill, whose relations with the “eminences” described is closely followed, particularly in two chapters: “The Tories versus Churchill during ‘Their Finest Hour’” and “Churchill, Race and the ‘Magpie Society.’”</p>
<p><strong>Rose, Norman. <em>Churchill: An Unruly Life.</em> London: Simon and Schuster; <em>Churchill: The Unruly Giant. </em>New York: Free Press, 1994, 516 pp. Softbound reprints. Translations: Russian. </strong>✸ “Rose lays more stress on Churchill’s struggles and flaws than on his successes and strengths [but] presents Churchill’s early career as preparation.” This biography by an Israeli historian gleams with unfamiliar quotations, although the copy editor could have done a better job. Rose’s book is a model among political biographies: judicious and well-crafted.</p>
<p><strong>Sainsbury, Keith. <em>Churchill and Roosevelt at War: The War They Fought and the Peace They Hoped to Make. </em>New York: New York University Press, London: Macmillan, 1994, 224 pp. Revised edition, 1996. </strong>✸ Described by a reviewer as “Charmley Lite,” this scholarly collection of essays aims to reexamine and reinterpret the Churchill-Roosevelt relationship, particularly over the issues of France, China, Poland and the World War II Second Front, to show how Churchill presided over the decline of British greatness. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Sandys, Celia. <em>From Winston with Love and Kisses</em>. London: Sinclair-Stevenson/Reed Consumer Books, 1994, 224 pp. <em>The Young Churchill.</em> New York: Dutton 1995, 224 pp. Translations: Japanese. </strong>✸ A colorful and interesting book on Churchill’s youth by his granddaughter, with many fascinating new color and black and white illustrations. Though the ground is well-trod by other works, this uncritical work by his granddaughter provides useful insight into Churchill’s formative years.</p>
<h3><strong>1995</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Alldritt, Keith. <em>The Greatest of Friends: Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill 1941- 1945.</em> New York: St. Martin’s Press; London: Robert Hale, 1995, 224 pp. </strong>✸ An account of a colorful relationship between two formidable and complex personalities, with its rich vein of wit, poignancy and hubris, and its parade of successes and failures, betrayals and jealousies, tiffs and snubs. Some readers find it fairly light, with little that is new.</p>
<p><strong>Ashizawa, Yoshiko. <em>Chāchiru</em>. Tokyo: Gyosei, 1995, 304 pp., text in Japanese. </strong>✸ Juvenile.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalleri, Giorgio. <em>Ombre sul lago: dal carteggio Churchill-Mussolini [Shadows on the Lake: The Correspondence Churchill-Mussolini].</em> Casale Monferrato, AL: Piemme, 1994, 240 pp., text in Italian. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/larma-segreta-del-duce-by-mimmo-franzinelli/">Commentary by Hillsdale.</a> Surely more ink has been wasted on the non-existent or forged Churchill-Mussolini letters than on any other fictitious assertion.</p>
<p><strong>Charmley, John. <em>Churchill’s Grand Alliance: The Anglo-American Special Relationship 1940-1957.</em> London: Hodder and Stoughton, New York: Harcourt Brace, 1995, 428 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ The author argues that Churchill and his successors rendered Britain the vassal state of America. Charmley’s argument has a degree of validity, though many of Britain’s wounds were self-inflicted. For example, the author ignores the many instances, such as India, where Churchill successfully opposed Roosevelt’s initiatives and prescriptions. Nevertheless, this book is a solid critical history, well researched and welcome to thoughtful readers.</p>
<p><strong>Hermann, Richard. <em>Med skejebnen i hånden: Churchill-slekten i krig og fred [With Destiny in Hand: The Churchill Clan in War and Peace].</em> Oslo: Cappelens, 1995, 380 pp., text in Norwegian. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>James, Alfred, ed. <em>References in the Indices to Sir Winston Churchill, Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (Hansard) House of Commons</em>. 2 vols., 1901-25 and 1926-65. Wahroonga, Australia, privately published by the author, 1995, 175 pp. and 190 pp. respectively. Limited to 20 copies. </strong>✸ A useful index to Churchill in Hansard, since eclipsed by online resources.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan, Anthony J. <em>Churchill: A Founder of Modern Ireland</em>. Dublin: Westport Books, 1995, 208 pp. </strong>✸ Discusses Churchill’s role in forging the 1922 Irish Treaty.</p>
<p><strong>Larres, Klaus. <em>Politik der Illusionen: Churchill, Eisenhower und die deutsche Frage [Politics of Illusion: Churchill, Eisenhower and the German Question].</em> Göttingen, Germany: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1995, 336 pp., text in German. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mansfield, Stephen. <em>Never Give In: The Extraordinary Character of Winston Churchill</em>. Elkton, Md.: Highland Books, 1995, 225 pp. Reprints. Republished <em>Never Give In: The Character and Greatness of Winston Churchill. Hero in Time of Crisis</em>, 2000. </strong>✸ Explains eloquently why Britain lacked Churchill’s will during the rise of Hitler, but the influence of religion is seriously overdrawn. Churchill “never felt obligated [crassly to] advertise himself as a believer” (perhaps because he wasn’t one). There are also many incorrect statements about Churchill’s wife, son, mother, even Chartwell Farm. Churchill was indeed, “a noble spirit.” His nobility of character still deserves exposition. —Michael Richards</p>
<p><strong>Mieder, Wolfgang and Bryan, George B. <em>The Proverbial Winston S. Churchill: An Index to Proverbs in the Works of Sir Winston Churchill.</em> Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press; London: Cassell, 1995, 436 pp. Reprints, softbound. </strong>✸ The authors track Churchill’s use of proverbs, folklore and famous expressions in his writings and speeches. (Look up “blood, toil, tears and sweat” and you find Churchill joined “blood and tears” in 1900 and added “sweat” in 1931.) When Churchill used quote marks around an expression, the authors find the source. But they display little knowledge of Churchill’s canon, make many errors, and use a clumsy numerical reference to Churchill’s books following no bibliographic order. The book does show how Churchill’s photographic memory helped him cast back for proverbs in his writings and speeches.</p>
<p><strong>Montague Browne, Anthony. <em>Long Sunset: Memoirs of Winston Churchill’s Last Private Secretary.</em> London: Cassell, 1995, 376 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ An intimate memoir of “life on the inside,” eloquently written by his 1952-65 private secretary; forthright and at times blunt, eminently readable and exciting. Also covers Montague Browne’s career in the wartime RAF, the postwar Foreign Office, and as a courtier to HM the Queen.</p>
<p><strong>Parker, R.A.C., ed. <em>Winston Churchill: Studies in Statesmanship</em>. London: Brassey’s, 1995, 260 pp. Expanded edition, 2002. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/parker-studies-statesmanship/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Papers range from the daughterly observations of Lady Soames to Churchill’s relations with Adenauer and his approach to such abstracts as “the European Idea.” <em>Contributors</em>: Martin Gilbert: “Churchill and the European Idea.” Tage Kaarsted: “Churchill and the Small States of Europe: The Danish Case.” François Kersaudy: “Churchill and de Gaulle.” Warren Kimball: “Churchill, Roosevelt and Post-War Europe.” Wolfgang Krieger: “Churchill and the Defence of the West 1951-1955.” Bernd Martin: “Churchill and Hitler, 1940.” Brian McKercher: “Churchill, the European Balance of Power and the USA.” Phillip O’Brien: “Churchill and the U.S. Navy.” Ritchie Ovendale: “Churchill and the Middle East.” Alistair Parker: Introduction.

<p><strong>Rachev, Stoian. <em>Churchil, Bulgaria i Balkanite 1939-1945 [Churchill, Bulgaria and the Balkans]. </em>Sofia: S. Rachev, 1995, 500 pp., text in Bulgarian. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ramsden, John A. <em>The Age of Churchill and Eden 1940-1957</em>. London, Longman, 1995, 350 pp. Volume 4 in the series “The History of the Conservative Party.” </strong>✸ This important work naturally contains numerous political references to the premierships of Churchill and Eden.</p>
<p><strong>Ratnu, Inder Dan. <em>Alternative to Churchill: The Eternal Bondage</em>. Jaipur, India: self-published by the author, 1995, softbound. </strong>✸ Part fiction. World War II is recounted accurately until May 1940, when the author fashions an alternate history: Chamberlain remains prime minister, loses the Battle of Britain; Russia falls to the Germans; America is isolated, then subdued with the help of atomic bombs; the Third Reich triumphs; Churchill ends his life in exile in the Falkland Islands, where he sparks a guerrilla movement. The text wanders and English is not the author’s first language, but this is an imaginative and chilling account of what might have happened.</p>
<p><strong>Rintala, Marvin. <em>Lloyd George and Churchill: How Friendship Changed Politics</em>. Lanham, Md.: Madison Books, distributed by National Book Network, 1995, 232 pp. </strong>✸ A good book on the subject is needed, but this isn’t it. There is much about Lloyd George and Churchill, some of it incorrect, some written in poor English; but the main fault is insufficient comparison between them and analysis of their complex relationship. There is nothing, for example, on their pre-World War I collaboration on defense, and little on their post-1917 political relations.</p>
<p><strong>Shogan, Robert. <em>Hard Bargain: How FDR Twisted Churchill’s Arm, Evaded the Law, and Changed the Role of the American Presidency</em>. New York: Scribner, 1995, 320 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ In the destroyers-for-bases swap with Churchill, the author writes, Roosevelt helped keep Britain in the war in 1941—but he also laid groundwork for an Imperial Presidency, which led in time to Korea, Vietnam, Iran-Contra, Desert Storm and Haiti. Despite its hair-raising title, this book comes with notable endorsements and is worth a look.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas, David A. <em>Churchill: The Member for Woodford.</em> Iford, Essex: Frank Cass, 1995, 224 pp. </strong>✸ A detailed history of Churchill and the constituency he represented from 1924 to 1964. The author, a naval historian, takes time out from his usual pursuits to compile the results for every Churchill election, summarizing the campaigns and tracing the history of Churchill’s career as a local MP. Excellent resource.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson, Thomas. <em>Churchill and the Prof.</em> London: Cassell, 1995, 248 pp. </strong>✸ In an impeccably researched and well-written book, Professor Wilson, who worked in his twenties under Professor Lindemann, presents the first study of Churchill’s scientific adviser in thirty years. The main subject is Lindemann’s role in World War II, which naturally closely involves the prime minister.</p>

Churchill to Christine Lewis Conover, 1899-1943.</em> Washington: The Churchill Center, 1996, 36 pp., softbound, 50 copies hardbound in leather. </strong>✸ Foreword by Martin Gilbert. Returning from India in 1899, Churchill met a young American girl and carried on a correspondence for several years, sending his regrets that he could not attend her wedding in Philadelphia. When he visited Washington in 1943 she wrote him there. He remembered, sending her an autographed photo to match the one he had inscribed for her in 1899. Includes a charming memoir by Conover. Illustrated with photos and copies of their early correspondence. Note: the letter on page 10 is misdated 4 February and should be 2 April.</p>
<p><strong>Neville, Peter. <em>Winston Churchill: Statesman or Opportunist?</em> London: Hodder-Stoughton, 1996, 158 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ Clearly, says Neville, Churchill was the latter; but the scholarship offered to back up this opinion is not persuasive.</p>

<p><strong>Roberts, Andrew. <em>Churchill: Embattled Hero</em>. London: Orion Books “Phoenix Edition,” 1996, 62 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ An abridgement of Chapter 3 of the author’s <em>Eminent Churchillians </em>(1995)<em>,</em> designed to show why Churchill has been reassessed so much of late, and why it will have no effect on his standing in history.</p>
<p><strong>Severance, John. <em>Sir Winston Churchill: Soldier, Statesman, Artist</em>. New York: Clarion Books, 1996, 144 pp. </strong>✸ An illustrated biography for young people restores an appreciation for Churchill not being taught in schools, while puncturing many widely held beliefs about him. This book was highly praised by Lady Soames as one of the best juveniles yet published.</p>
<p><strong>Talbott, Frederick. <em>Churchill on Courage: Timeless Wisdom for Persevering</em>. Nashville, Tenn.: Thomas Nelson, 1996, 162 pp. </strong>✸ A physically handsome little book which provides carefully attributed quotes demonstrating Churchill’s courage, informing us of the context and remarks from which the words are drawn.</p>
<p><strong>Vogt, Werner. <em>Winston Churchill: Mahnung, Hoffnung und Vision [Warning, Hope and Vision] 1938-1946</em>. Zürich: Verlag Neue Züricher Zeitung, 1996, 576 pp., text in German. </strong>✸ A media study of Churchill’s coverage by Zurich’s leading newspaper during the period when Switzerland preserved a precarious neutrality, swimming in a Nazi continent. The author, a member of the Churchill Society, is ardently pro-Churchill and not critical; included is Churchill’s “Europe Unite” speech in Zurich in 1946.</p>
<p><strong>Waszak, Leon J. <em>Agreement in Principle: The Wartime Partnership of Gen. Wladyslaw Sikorski and Winston Churchill.</em> New York: P. Lang, 1996, 120 pp. </strong>✸ Churchill said, “There are few virtues the Poles do not possess, and few mistakes they have avoided.” Sikorski might have made a difference, had he lived. A unique study of the Churchill-Sikorski wartime partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Young, John H. <em>Winston Churchill’s Last Campaign: Britain and the Cold War, 1951-1955.</em> Oxford and New York: Clarendon Press, 1996, 368 pp. </strong>✸ The author describes Churchill’s awareness of the peril for the world following the invention of nuclear weapons, and his measures to avoid a nuclear war. Churchill’s last cause was world peace: his efforts, unsuccessful as they were, are presented exhaustively and sympathetically.</p>
<h3><strong>1997</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Beiriger, Eugene Edward. <em>Churchill, Munitions and Mechanical Warfare: The Politics of Supply and Strategy.</em> New York: Peter Lang, 1997, 188 pp. </strong>✸ Originally a Ph.D. thesis, University of Illinois, 1992. A study of Churchill at the Ministry of Munitions (July 1917-January 1919). His greatest contribution was his comprehensive approach to military warfare and the supply of mortars, tanks, and airplanes. Reliable on Churchill’s strategic thinking, but the author does not put Churchill’s actions into context or examine his influence. Larry Arnn’s dissertation on Churchill at the Munitions Ministry is much better and more discerning.</p>
<p><strong>Denniston, Robin. <em>Churchill’s Secret War: Diplomatic Decrypts, the Foreign Office and Turkey, 1942-1944</em>. New York: St. Martin’s; Stroud: Sutton, 1997, 208 pp. </strong><strong>Reprints.</strong> ✸ An interesting study of Churchill’s use of secret signals intelligence before and during World War II, and his efforts to bring Turkey into the war. New information on the 1943 Cicero spy scandal when secret foreign office documents were stolen in Ankara by the British Ambassador’s valet, who passed them to the Germans—Britain’s biggest Foreign Office security lapse of the war. The author, whose father ran GCCS in Bletchley Park till 1942, forcibly illustrates Churchill’s penchant for reading raw intelligence material, the way he used it and the potent mix of hope and desperation that often provided information for his political and strategic thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>Winston Churchill and Emery Reves: Correspondence 1937-1964</em>. Austin, Tex.: University of Texas Press, 1997, 398 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/reves-churchill-correspondence/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Reves was Churchill’s “diffuser,” spreading Churchill’s screed to Europe through books and articles. After the war, Reves helped sell the serial rights to Churchill’s war memoirs. The story of the sale of the war memoirs to Henry Luce for <em>Life</em> would make a movie, and perhaps should. An absorbing book, this work documents the dual genius of Reves and Churchill. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Hayward, Steven F. <em>Churchill on Leadership: Executive Success in the Face of Adversity</em>. Rocklin, Calif.: Forum, 1997. 250 pp. Reprints, softbound. Translations: Japanese. </strong>✸ A study in “applied Churchill” for leaders, businesspeople or those who must speak for a living. Hayward presents Churchill as a model, using his life to illustrate the maxims and character that he relied upon. Far and away the best of this genre, since it is based on serious study of Churchill and offers many specific examples.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball, Warren F. <em>Forged in War: Roosevelt, Churchill and the Second World War</em>. London: Harper 1997; New York, 1998, 422 pp., softbound. Reprints. </strong>✸ The author blends a sound view of the war with a barrage of sources and his own challenging opinions, presenting a thoughtful book that furthers understanding, or at least debate, on “the partnership that saved the west.”</p>

To understand the peacemaker, examine his actions: How did Churchill further peace from the Boer War to the Cold War?

<p><strong>Pelling, Henry. <em>Churchill’s Peacetime Ministry, 1951-1955</em>. London: Macmillan; New York: St. Martin’s, 1997, 216 pp. </strong>✸ An important contribution to the historiography of Churchill’s postwar premiership, which should be compared with Seldon’s <em>Churchill’s Indian Summer</em> (1981). Pelling, whose 1974 Churchill biography was excellent, takes the optimistic view, arguing that Churchill’s administration set the stage for nearly a half century of Tory dominance.</p>
<p><strong>Read, Craig. <em>Challenging the Tribe: Sir Winston Churchill, World Government and Leadership</em>. London: Minerva, 1997, 402 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ A book on leadership, looking at Churchill from the standpoint of world government which the author says Churchill favored (he didn’t); and Churchill’s dedication to liberal democracy. Many errors occur in a superfluous biography which seems to be represented as a specialized study.</p>
<p><strong>Stafford, David. <em>Churchill and Secret Service</em>. London: John Murray, 1997; Toronto: Stoddardt, Woodstock, N.Y.: The Overlook Press, 1998, 386 pp. Several reprints. Translations: Polish. </strong>✸ Stafford’s expert account of Churchill’s involvement with secret intelligence provides three things hitherto lacking: a complete account of WSC’s involvement with intelligence spanning Churchill’s full career; a parade of facts hitherto obscure or missing; and, most important, up-to-date research based on recently released secret papers.</p>
<p><strong>Strawson, John. <em>Churchill and Hitler: In Victory and Defeat</em>. London: Constable. New York: Fromm International, 1997, 540 pp. </strong>✸ Strawson recognizes the crucial Churchill-Hitler duel when Britain was faced with fighting or turning aside; but he takes the story of both men through the war, devoting big chapters to each year, and ends with a “Verdict” that considers the views of Churchill’s admirers, critics and colleagues. WSC, says this positive account, “did not want war, but the war he got changed history.” Criticized as light and offering little new material; gratuitous jibes at some revisionist historians could have been left out.</p>

<p><strong>Delaforce, Patrick. <em>Churchill’s Secret Weapon: The Story of Hobart’s Funnies</em>. London: Robert Hale, 1998, 256 pp. </strong><strong>Reprints.</strong> ✸ Churchill in the title abets sales, but this is mainly about Britain’s technical devices and weaponry, which he supported. “Hobart” (Major General Percy, nicknamed “Hobo”), was an irascible but clever tank authority in charge of what some called “Churchill’s Toy Factory.” The PM was fascinated by his wizardry, but this is a book about Hobart, not Churchill.</p>

Layman’s Questions about Churchill.</em> Jaipur, India: Mumal Publishers, 1998, 112 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ Contains 100 questions Indians frequently ask about Churchill. Many involve Gandhi, and why Indians should admire the man who opposed the Mahatma. The author, who recites Churchill war speeches to Indian audiences, is an admirer of both. Ratnu makes a strong case for Churchill as his country’s indispensable and ultimate liberator, by making the world safe for democracies like India.</p>

Mary Soames is a fine editor. Her unrivalled knowledge of the subject is complemented by literary and historical skills which are gracefully worn but highly professional&#8230;.In bringing together both sides of the correspondence, and eliminating everything else, she has revealed as never before the inside story of a marriage that was also a great political partnership. —Paul Addison</p>

<p><strong>Bédarida, François. <em>Churchill</em>. Paris: Fayard, 1999, 571 pp., text in French. Translations: Spanish. </strong>✸ The author is a French authority on British history and the Second World War. “Seeks to scrutinize the resiliency of a fantastic personality, both flamboyant and contradictory. Bédarida believes young Winston’s lack of affection from his parents left ‘an indelible mark on his innermost being,’ resulting in an incessant need to attract attention and to seek recognition. Throughout his life he had to fight against his cyclothymic nature.” —<em>Le Monde</em></p>

London: Othila Press, 1999, 144 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchills-radical-decade-hill/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Relatively little has been published on Churchill’s ten years (1904-14) as a crusading Liberal, railing against the privileges of his class, proposing old age pensions, prison reform and unemployment insurance. Hill believes that Churchill’s quest was “hopeless” because he did not believe the state should “take responsibility by taxation for retirement, education, health and welfare.” Yet Churchill showed “unusual stature” in his efforts to mitigate poverty, well in advance of Roosevelt. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Højris, René. <em>Churchill: Århundredets Person</em> <em>[Person of the Century]. </em>Copenhagen: Forlaget Roger, 1999, 298 pp., softbound, text in Danish. </strong>✸ An extensive volume of Churchill quotations, black and white photographs and cartoons covering his entire life, with special emphasis on Churchill and Denmark.</p>

Translations: Estonian. </strong>✸ Count Krockow, a political scientist, aims to provide readers with a fair and truthful picture of Churchill as the exemplary antagonist of tyranny, instead of merely the colorful figure of popular myth and legend.</p>
<p><strong>Lukacs, John. <em>Five Days in London, May 1940</em>. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999, 236 pp. </strong><strong>Reprints.</strong> ✸ An account of the five days between 24 and 28 May 1940, when the British Cabinet debated whether to negotiate with Hitler, a period the author believes settled the outcome of the war. Lukacs shows that Halifax, though he dropped appeasement before Chamberlain, had become more defeatist by May 1940, arguing that Britain should approach Mussolini to arbitrate between Britain and Germany. Once even Churchill seemed to lean toward a deal—although he quickly changed his tune, and carried his entire Cabinet with him. Highly praised by reviewers. The author’s earlier book, <em>The Duel</em>, is a parallel work.</p>
<p><strong>Marx, Roland. <em>Winston Churchill: Enfance et [Childhood and] Adolescence</em>. Paris: Éditions Autrement, 1999, 170 pp. </strong>✸ Describes the formative years, ending when Churchill enters public life. The author believes Churchill was greatly influenced by the fame of his father and the wealth of his mother; his mother would not agree that she had any wealth, although she lived as if she did.</p>
<p><strong>Muller, James W., ed. <em>Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” Speech Fifty Years Later</em>. Columbia, Mo.: University of Missouri Press, 1999, 180 pp. </strong>✸ Papers from a colloquium at Fulton on the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech, which forms the first section of the book.

<p><strong>Penn, Geoffrey. <em>Fisher, Churchill and the Dardanelles</em>. Barnsley, South Yorkshire: Leo Cooper, 1999, 280 pp. </strong>✸ A dramatic account, this is the first book to look at the Dardanelles Campaign from the political rather than the military angle. Why was it decided to force the Dardanelles “by ships alone”? Was the concept sound, or flawed from the start? And who was responsible for what? Churchill does not escape some blame, but does not come off too badly. A unique, judicious and balanced study.</p>
<p><strong>Sandys, Celia. <em>Churchill: Wanted Dead or Alive</em>. London: Harper, 1999; New York, Carroll and Graf Publishers, 2000, 234 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ In this extensive recap of her grandfather’s adventures in South Africa during the Boer War, Churchill’s granddaughter retraces his footsteps and interviews the descendants of the people who aided and opposed Churchill’s epic escape from the Boer prison camp. One of the author’s best books, with much new and revealing material on her grandfather’s prison break.</p>

He concludes that they hid much from each other, yet simultaneously arrived at a personal relationship unique in history,</p>

Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press, 2001, 534 pp. </strong>✸ What were the political machinations that kept Chamberlain in office during the late 1930s, and Churchill out? Was Churchill the prophet of uncomfortable truths or was Chamberlain right to pursue appeasement? “Examines the restrictions party conformity places upon ambitious politicians, and analyzes how best dissidents can alter Government policy&#8230;.An engrossing tale, well told—a real historical thriller.” An evenhanded account of the politics of the fatal late 1930s.</p>

<p><strong>Ashworth, Leon. <em>Winston Churchill.</em> Slough: Cherrytree Books, 2000, 32 pp. Reprints. Toronto: Evans Brothers Ltd.; Slough: Cherry Tree, 2001. </strong>✸ An impressive demonstration of how Churchill&#8217;s massive life can be compressed, but it falls short of Fiona Reynoldson’s superlative juvenile (2001) with only half the page count. More suitable for youngsters just beginning to read than Reynoldson’s 10-13 age group.</p>
<p><strong>Barrett, Buckley. <em>Churchill: A Concise Bibliography</em>. Westport, Conn., London: Greenwood Press, 2000, 216 pp. </strong>✸ Breaks Churchill’s books into collections/selections, histories and miscellaneous, books about Churchill into literary/rhetorical/artistic, biographic/personal, politics/governance, foreign/military, philosophy/psychology/religion, fiction/satire/media and juvenile. Categories are arbitrary and some books overlap. Within each section, books are alphabetical by title, not chronological as normal, so it’s more a book for browsing than reference. This book succeeds or fails on its annotations, which seem thoughtful and unbiased.</p>
<p><strong>Baughman, T.H. and Suelter, Emily E., eds. <em>Aspects of Winston S. Churchill. </em>Largo, Fla.: Theresa Press, 2000, 148 pp. </strong>✸ Eight Benedictine College undergraduate essays on Churchill on Free Trade, women’s suffrage, Germany, Versailles, the Irish Treaty, General Strike, Zionism and Palestine. Thoroughly footnoted, they quote many sources. But the conclusions are not always well thought out, and there’s little new that pops out.<strong> </strong></p>

Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2000, 234 pp., hardbound and softbound. </strong>✸ A critical work which traces Churchill’s encounters with Bolsheviks from the October 1917 Revolution through the Iron Curtain speech, accusing Churchill of self-motivation and somersaults, immaturity, unsteadiness and lack of proportion.

<p><strong>Folly, Martin H. <em>Churchill, Whitehall and the Soviet Union</em>, 1940-1945. New York: St. Martin’s Press; Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000, 238 pp. </strong>✸ Not revisionist history, just a plainspoken summary of previous books and official documents. It is thorough, not to say tedious, and draws unremarkable conclusions: Churchill and the Anglo-Americans didn&#8217;t cause the Cold War; neither did they do much overtly to prevent it. (Could it have caused itself?)</p>

Reprints. </strong>✸ Several self-help books for speakers using Churchill as an example exist. Along with only Hayward’s excellent <em>Churchill on Leadership</em> (1997), this book expands on the theme, using Churchill’s practices to show how to lead, communicate, meet goals, withstand failure, build self-esteem, and use simplicity and risk to your advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Parker, R.A.C. <em>Churchill and Appeasement</em>. London: Macmillan, 2000, 290 pp. </strong>✸ Could Churchill have prevented World War II? Oxford historian Parker thinks he could have, if he had controlled British foreign policy in the 1930s and persuaded Stalin that Britain and France were safer collaborators than Hitler. Authoritative and elegantly written, a brilliant reappraisal of Churchill’s most depressing political failure, with a tantalizing glimpse of how very different 20th century history might have been.</p>
<p><strong>Rasor, Eugene L. <em>Winston S. Churchill, 1874-1965: A Comprehensive Historiography and Annotated Bibliography</em>. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2000, 704 pp. </strong>✸ Aims to define the literature by and about Churchill, with annotations on its content, with an annotated bibliography and subject and author indexes. There are many errors and omissions, particularly foreign language titles, and much material listed has at best only a peripheral bearing on Churchill: “&#8230;can only be condemned outright for its essentially valueless treatment of works by Churchill. The rest of the volume contains a wealth of useful information&#8230;even if it must be used with caution. It is a frustrating, confusing, and sometimes misleading work, but for the time being it is the best reference book available on the vast literature about Winston Churchill. —Christopher H. Bell</p>
<p><strong>Rueda Gonzalez, Ricardo. <em>La Historia medica de Winston Spencer Churchill [Medical History of Winston Spencer Churchill].</em> Bogotá: Instituto de Genetica Humana Facultad de Medicina, Pontifica Universidad, 2000, 238 pp. Text in Spanish. </strong>✸ Reviews some of Churchill’s illnesses, but the text is unreferenced. No original sources of medical information appear to have been consulted, which explains how inaccuracies in the medical history have been introduced. The book concludes with 33 general references, which excludes several highly relevant books published before 2000.</p>

The statesman-author adds perspective as a veteran of the House of Commons, explaining much about the offices he and Churchill held. (The Home Office, he writes, is “a plank of wood out of which all other domestic ministries have been carved.”) Jenkins concludes that having previously considered Gladstone the greatest prime minister, he now gives that title to Churchill.</p>

Several reprints. </strong>✸ A respected military historian first highlights Churchill’s strength and leadership in 1940. It’s a good start, but it doesn’t maintain the pace. The rest reiterates a well-trod palimpsest which Robert Rhodes James would label just another “case for the defence.” The great columnist Florence King said you could measure the worth of books by her marginal notes, furiously written all over the books that absorb her (for good or ill). Well, I went through this one without a solitary note and only two dog-ears.</p>

<p><strong>Kersaudy, François. <em>Churchill et Monaco.</em> Monaco: Editions du Rocher, 2002, 112 pp., text in French. </strong>✸ A book on Churchill and Monaco would be thin indeed, so Kersaudy covers Churchill’s visits to and relationships with the French Riviera in general. We meet his Riviera hosts from Maxine Elliott to Wendy Reves and follow his search for a villa of his own. Not much is new except for French readers, for whom the account is mainly intended. —AC</p>

Drawing on fresh material, Ramsden shows how Churchill’s personality and self-vision shaped our perceptions of nationhood. He argues that Churchill’s romantic, imperial view of Britain contributed to contemporary political culture, including Britain’s attitude toward Europe.</p>

Churchill for Dummies? Maybe WSC by dummies. The book seems not to have been reviewed by people familiar with Churchill, resulting in some ghastly errors, such as the title of Churchill’s novel, <em>Romola.</em> There are better brief lives all over this bibliography.</p>

Ruotsila argues that Churchill remained sympathetic to Finland only as long as he didn’t need Russia: that his geo-strategical side took priority over his anti-communist leanings.</p>

Valiunas shows how <em>The World Crisis, Marlborough</em> and <em>The Second World War</em> teach the prudence needed for self-government in a democracy. An important book, with good insights, that sorely needed more work on the author’s part before it was published: its references are exceedingly sloppy.</p>

But there are so many omissions, and so much space devoted to the relatively unimportant, that it becomes a massive error of proportion. More a “Biographical Acquaintance” than a companion.</p>

<p><strong>Adams, Simon. <em>Winston Churchill. </em>London: Franklin Watts; Austin, Tex.: Raintree Steck-Vaughn Publishers, 2003, 112 pp.; London: British Library, 144 pp. </strong>✸ Much like Reynoldson’s superb juvenile, this one organizes old chestnut photos with relevant sidebars and large text, aiming at ages 10-15. The sidebars cover much the same material, are fewer in number and lack Reynoldson’s deft and unerringly accurate observations.</p>

While Gilbert makes it clear that the war on terrorism bears no relation to sustained two-year bombing of cities, millions of deaths, and ferocious battles on land and sea, he generously dedicates this volume to President Bush and Prime Minister Blair.</p>

<p><strong>Sandys, Celia. <em>Churchill.</em> London: Contender Books, 2003, 160 pp. </strong>✸ Written to accompany a TV series; I expected just another “brief Churchill life,” a field thickly populated with the good, the bad and the potboilers, but found this one of the best short biographies ever published about Churchill, and in my opinion Celia Sandys’ best book yet.</p>

Courtenay');">Reviewed by Paul H. Courtenay</a>. A lasting and important contribution to our understanding of Churchill’s literary methods, this exhaustive work has been roundly praised by Churchill proponents and critics alike. Reynolds digs deep into the bones of the war memoirs, showing how they were written, in part by a crack team of experts, while not discrediting Churchill for signing off on the final text.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Addison, Paul. <em>Churchill: The Unexpected Hero</em>. Oxford: New York: Oxford University Press, “Lives and Legacies” Series, 2005, 308 pp. </strong>✸ The author makes an often-missed point: In the Second World War, Churchill won twice: over Nazi Germany, and over a legion of sceptics who derided his judgement and denied his claims to greatness. Regarded by many critics as of the best “brief lives” ever published on Churchill. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Benson, Tim.<em> Churchill in Caricature.</em> London: Political Cartoon Society, 2005, 96 pp. </strong>✸ Expertly captioned portrayal of Churchill in cartoons, where artists took advantage of his famous props: cigars, siren suits, hats and victory salutes.

<p><strong>Best, Geoffrey. <em>Churchill and War</em>. London: New York: Hambledon and London, Bloomsbury, 2005, 354 pp. </strong>✸ Geoffrey Best highlights the dominant theme of war in Churchill’s career, starting with his early service in India and going all the way to the nuclear age he feared. This accomplished historian shows how Churchill’s experience in prior wars governed his actions and decisions in the Second World War. An outstanding study of Churchill as war leader. —RML</p>

<p><strong>Dilks, David. <em>The Great Dominion: Winston Churchill in Canada 1900-1954</em>. Toronto: Thomas Allen Publishers, 2005, 472 pp. 512 pp. </strong>✸ The most thorough, best-researched account on Churchill’s long love affair with Canada, where he once contemplated emigrating, and to which referred to as the “linchpin” of the English-Speaking Peoples. A standard work. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Fenby, Jonathan. <em>The Sinking of the </em>Lancastria<em>: Britain’s Greatest Maritime Disaster and Churchill’s Cover-Up.</em> London: Simon and Schuster; New York: Carroll and Graf, 2005, 270 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ The liner <em>Lancastria</em> was sunk on 17 June 1940 off St. Nazaire while evacuating soldiers and civilians. Details were censored through 2040. This has not prevented investigations and interviews with survivors, from which Fenby sees a cover-up. A bit odd, since Churchill mentioned the “frightful incident” in his war memoirs, and later said: “I had intended to release the news a few days later, but events crowded upon us so black and so quickly that I forgot to lift the ban, and it was some years before the knowledge of this horror became public.” —RML</p>
<p><strong>Fisher, David E. <em>A Summer Bright and Terrible: Winston Churchill, Lord Dowding, Radar and the Impossible Triumph of the Battle of Britain</em>. Washington, D.C.: Shoemaker and Hoard, 2005, 288 pp., softbound 2006. ✸ </strong>Focuses on 1940, the Battle of Britain and the role of radar, clearly unsympathetic to Air Marshal &#8220;Stuffy&#8221; Dowding; also covers his two chief lieutenants, Trafford Leigh-Mallory (backer of the &#8220;big wing&#8221; notion of massing defending fighters) and Keith Park (who agreed with Dowding&#8217;s &#8220;bits and pieces&#8221; use of defending aircraft). —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Forster, John and Bapasola, Jeri. <em>Winston and Blenheim</em>. Woodstock: Blenheim Palace, 2005, 20 pp. softbound. ✸ </strong>Lavish promotion by Blenheim with colorful images of the palace and correspondence by the First Duke and WSC. Unfortunately, there are several errors, including mislabeling Churchill as War Secretary in 1918 and referring his biography of his father as “his first major book.&#8221; —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>Churchill and America</em>. New York: Free Press; London: Pocket Books; Toronto: McClelland and Stewart 2005, 560 pp. Reprints, audiobook. Translations: Czech. </strong>✸ The official biographer examines the breadth of Churchill’s 60-year relationship with America and Americans, and his 16 visits, some of them lengthy, to the United States. Unprecedented depth of detail, but a more clinical approach than Robert Pilpel’s <em>Churchill in America</em> (1976). Both books should be read. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Hayward, Steven. <em>Greatness: Reagan, Churchill and the Making of Extraordinary Leaders.</em> New York: Crown Forum, 2005, 204 pp. Reprints, softbound. ✸ </strong>An insightful and not uncritical analysis of two great and independent thinking political figures of the 20th century, who demonstrated that individuals can translate wisdom into action for public good. Connected by the Cold War that was bookended by Churchill’s 1946 Iron Curtain speech and Reagan’s 1987 “Tear Down This Wall” speech, both believed the ideological conflict could be won peacefully against the face of conventional wisdom. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Hickman, Tom. <em>Churchill’s Bodyguard</em>. London: Headline, 2005, 312 pp., hardbound and softbound. </strong>✸ Covers detective-inspector Walter H. Thompson—the tall, angular figure who accompanied Churchill in the 1920s and again during and after the Second World War. Criticized for inaccuracies; the reader is better advised to read Thompson’s own four books (search for “Thompson”). —RML</p>
<p><strong>Holmes, Richard. <em>In the Footsteps of Churchill.</em> London: BBC Books, 2005, 352 pp. </strong>✸ The author produced television documentaries, and this book was published alongside the BBC series by that name, following Churchill’s footsteps from the mud of Flanders to the White House. Not easy to access, valuable in its own way, but Holmes sometimes grinds his own Europhobic axes while discussing Churchillian politics. —AC</p>
<p><strong>Hunter, Ian, ed. <em>Winston and Archie: The Letters of Sir Archibald Sinclair and Winston S. Churchill, 1915-1960.</em> London: Politico’s, 2005, 530 pp. </strong>✸ A long and rich correspondence, much never before published. Churchill and Sinclair served together in First World War trenches, united to oppose the Bolsheviks in the War Office, and managed the Empire at the Colonial Office. In the 1930s Sinclair, as leader of the Liberals, stood with Churchill against appeasement. After he became prime minister, Churchill appointed Sinclair Secretary of State for Air. —RML</p>

Collins and Churchill were key figures in crafting the 1922 Irish Treaty that give the republic its independence. Collins was assassinated for his efforts. One of his last messages was, “Tell Winston we could have done nothing without him.” —RML</p>

<p><strong>Lewis, Brenda Ralph. <em>Churchill: An Illustrated History</em>. London: <em>Reader’s Digest</em>, 2005, 256 pp. Translations: Czech. </strong>✸ A disappointment. The publisher commissioned an established writer to produce a book on “WSC without checking whether she knew much more about the subject than the ordinary person in the street—and it shows. Exasperating minor errors are so numerous that they ruin whatever merits the book may have.” —PHC</p>

<p><strong>Nicholson, Arthur Pole. <em>Hostages to Fortune: Winston Churchill and the Loss of the</em> Prince of Wales <em>and</em> Repulse. Stroud, Gloucestershire: Sutton, 2005, 234 pp. </strong>✸ Churchill sent the two warships to form a “vague menace,” hoping to forestall the Japanese onslaught on Singapore. Air power proved their undoing and both were promptly sunk off Malaya. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Paterson, Michael. <em>Winston Churchill: His Military Life 1895-1945. </em>(Preliminary title: <em>“…Personal Accounts of the Great War Leader.”) </em>Newton Abbot and Cincinnati, Ohio: David and Charles; 320 pp. Softbound, 2006. Reprints. Translations: Czech. </strong>✸ The first word of the introduction, Churchill’s burial place (“Blandon”) might suggest it is unnecessary to read further. Accurate in chronology but laced with lengthy extracts from other people’s writings and insignificant people’s comments. Russell’s work (below) is the place to go for authoritative information on this subject. —PHC<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Alkon, Paul. <em>Winston Churchill’s Imagination</em>. Lewisburg, Penna.: Bucknell University Press, 2006, 268 pp. </strong>✸ A unique analysis of Churchill’s use of imagination in his writings. Alkon dwells on WSC’s relationship with Lawrence of Arabia, Charlie Chaplin and film producer Alexander Korda. He contemplates WSC’s imaginative engagement with science and science fiction: “the depiction of time, duration, and alternative history.” He also considers <em>The Dream</em>, a “private article” by the 72-year-old Winston, as he discusses the history of the 20th century with the ghost of his father. Well researched, this work is clearly argued and eloquently written. —RML</p>

<p><strong>Brezina, Deborah Davis. <em>The Spirit of Churchill. </em>New York: Avalon Press, 2006, 348 pp. </strong>✸ Bluntly admiring, lacking anything that is new, and without criticism, this is the type of one-sided hero-worship that does a disservice to Churchill by pretending that he is perfect. His human imperfections, and the way he surpassed them, are keys to his greatness. —RML</p>

<p><strong>Cohen, Ronald I. <em>Bibliography of the Writings of Sir Winston Churchill</em>. London: Thoemmes; New York: Continuum, 3 vols., 2006, 2184 pp. </strong>✸ The product of thirty years’ research and collecting, this is the ultimate and ever-standard bibliography of Churchill’s writings, encompassing Churchill’s published books, pamphlets, leaflets, contributions, articles, speeches, letters, memoranda and statements, together with the circumstances of publication. Its publication put all previous attempts at bibliography in the shade, and it will forever be consulted as the “last word.” —RML</p>
<p><strong>Corrigan, Gordon. <em>Blood, Sweat and Arrogance and the Myths of Churchill’s War. </em>London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2006, 496 pp., Reprints. </strong>✸ An ex-Gurkha major who likes “pricking the pompous” turns to Churchill, unable to grasp that in war, politics cannot be ignored. For example, he blithely asserts that sinking the French fleet in 1940 was unnecessary: the French “would have come to an agreement.” He has the luxury of such assumptions today. Anyone is free to hold Churchill in contempt, but to do so requires learning something about him. —Robert Courts</p>

<p><strong>Hall, Douglas. <em>The Book of Churchilliana. </em>London: New Cavendish Books, 2006, 192 pp. </strong>✸ A luxurious, full color, folio compilation of every souvenir item from toby jugs to cigar bands, along with Churchill-related places from Admiralty House to Westminster Abbey. Not a complete catalogue, and it’s sometimes hard to find the narrative connected to the illustrations, but the author includes notes on values (in 2006) and important details about manufacturers and their artists. The best bric-a-brac volume to date. —RML</p>

<h3><strong>2007</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Addison, Paul. <em>Winston Churchill.</em> Oxford: New York: Oxford University Press, “VIP” series, 2007, 138 pp. </strong>✸ The author’s Churchill entry for the <em>Oxford</em> <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em>. Hailed as a miniature masterpiece, an even briefer life than Addison’s <em>Unexpected Hero</em>. It is dramatic and penetrating, despite being fewer than 150 pages. The ideal book to read if you read nothing else about Churchill. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Andriola, Fabio. <em>Carteggio segreto Churchill–Mussolini</em> <em>[Secret Correspondence of Churchill and Mussolini]. </em>Milano: Sugarco, 2007, 406 pp. </strong>✸ Another in the endless supply of Mussolini-Churchill fake letters: the longest-running published canard in the Churchill field.

<p><strong>Bennett, Gil. <em>Churchill’s Man of Mystery: Desmond Morton and the World of Intelligence</em>. London and New York: Routledge, 2007, 404 pp. </strong>✸ A textbook on the history of the SIS, including many tedious details of internal jealousies. But as a piece of detective work covering information about an intensely private man, it will be required reading for those who want to know everything possible about an important figure at Churchill’s elbow. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Buczacki, Stefan. <em>Churchill and Chartwell: The Untold Story of Churchill’s Houses and Gardens. </em>London: Frances Lincoln, 2007, 324 pp. </strong>✸ The reigning authority on the Kentish home Churchill loved—and all his other homes: primary residences, government quarters, loans from or shares with family or friends, country houses, even holiday cottages. The result is the first comprehensive book about where Churchill lived throughout his long and eventful life. Standard work. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Callahan, Raymond A. <em>Churchill and His Generals</em>. Lawrence, Kans.: University Press of Kansas, 2007, 310 pp. </strong>✸ A careful and readable analysis by a scholar who avoids popular cant and concentrates instead on reality. “An outstanding study concerning the impressive institutional transformations of the British and Indian armies under great stress in World War II. —David Jablonsky</p>
<p><strong>Fenby, Jonathan. <em>Alliance: The Inside Story of How Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill Won One War and Began Another</em>. London: Simon and Schuster, 2007, 464 pp. Reprints, softbound. Translations: Polish. </strong>✸ Focusing on the Big Three relationship, Fenby crafts an intelligent story that starkly captures the more poignant moments from wartime summits: FDR’s physical frailty and his increasing mental incapacitation; Churchill’s frantic efforts to stay in FDR’s good graces as Britain’s status waned; and, perhaps most starkly, Stalin’s casual cruelty to friend and foe alike. —Ted Hutchinson</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>Churchill and the Jews: A Lifetime Friendship</em>. London: Simon and Schuster; New York: Henry Holt; Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 2007, 360 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ Churchill was forever committed to Zionism and the State of Israel. In the early 1920s he fought for the right of Jews to emigrate to Palestine, while always remaining optimistic that Arabs and Jews there could settle their differences. Drawn from a wide range of archives and private papers, speeches, newspaper coverage and wartime correspondence, this is one of several important works on Churchill and Jewry. —RML</p>

Annapolis, Md.: Naval Institute Press; London: Conway, 2007, 392 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ A finely-documented account of Churchill’s numerous wartime journeys. Clear maps help the reader follow the journeys by land and sea, from the luxury of the <em>Queen Mary</em> and <em>Queen Elizabeth </em>to the unheated and little-pressurized “Commando,” a transport version of the B-24. Well-written and fastidiously sourced, making it a standard work on the topic. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Lee, Celia and Lee, John: <em>Winston and Jack: The Churchill Brothers</em>. London: self-published, 2007, 408 pp. </strong>✸ The only comparative joint life of Winston and his brother, authoritatively drawn from personal correspondence and family archives. “A portrait of Jack that is at once impressive and humane. Jack was in many ways a simple man, a family man. He loved his wife, children and brother dearly. He was a hard worker and ambitious, but content to support rather than emulate Winston’s quest for political prominence.” —Ted Hutchinson</p>

Reprints, softbound. </strong>✸ Examines Churchill’s first speech as Prime Minister, 13 May 1940, a pivotal moment in his life, admitting that even Churchill had his doubts, at that juncture, to see “a way through” the war with Germany. An ardent admirer, Lukacs admits that “Churchill made no promises to his country in his speech, because he knew he had none to make.”</p>
<p><strong>Makovsky, Michael. <em>Churchill’s Promised Land: Zionism and Statecraft</em>. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007, 342 pp. </strong>✸ An excellent account which should be read alongside Gilbert’s <em>Churchill and the Jews</em> (2007, below). More critical than Gilbert, Makovsky notes Churchill’s inconsistencies in his views and policies, tracking the influence of politics and world strategy on his actions. But the author has no doubt about the moral impact of the Holocaust, and Churchill’s sentimentalism toward the Jewish people. —RML</p>
<p><strong>McGinty, Stephen. <em>Churchill’s Cigar</em>. London: McGinty, 2007, 214 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ Nothing one can’t read about in the standard biographies, say reviewers: “Not an intense historical piece but does give information about cigar history in England and insight into Churchill and his love of cigars throughout his life. Would recommend this to any cigar smoker.” —Alfred James</p>

Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2007, 276 pp. Second Edition: Sarasota, Fla.: Design Publishing, 2022, 482 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/bourke-cockran-mcmenamin-zoller/"><strong>Second Edition reviewed by Hillsdale:</strong></a> A valuable and enlightening work on young Winston’s mentor, Irish-American politician Bourke Cockran. The authors begin by showing how Churchill adopted Cockran’s political and economic views on democracy, capitalism, the Gold Standard, Free Trade and Socialism. Yet the story is biographical, covering all their meetings and private correspondence. The title is well taken, for this is the story of young Winston growing up. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Moody, Joanna and Margerison, Olive. <em>From Churchill’s War Rooms: Letters of a Secretary, 1943-45, </em>Stroud, Glos.: Tempus, 2007, 256 pp. </strong>✸ Uses Churchill in its title to enhance a book that is not about Churchill. It is instead the life of a delightful 92-year-old, Olive Margerison, who worked briefly in the War Rooms but has little to say of them except the deficient toilet facilities. It evokes memories, but does not add to our knowledge of WSC. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Olson, Lynne. <em>Troublesome Young Men: The Rebels Who Brought Churchill to Power and Helped Save England</em>. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux; London: Bloomsbury; Toronto: Anchor Canada, 2007, 436 pp. <em>Troublesome Young Men: The Churchill Conspiracy of 1940.</em> London: Bloomsbury. 2008. Several reprints. Translations: Dutch, Polish. </strong>✸ A popular writer looks at the few politicians willing to risk their careers by supporting Churchill’s fight against 1930s appeasement: Macmillan, Boothby, Amery, Ronald Cartland, Lord Cranborne and others. Olson is excellent on the political and personal dramas that played out as a result. Although the ground she covers is not new, the focus is unique and dramatic. Well worth the reading. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Reynolds, David. <em>From World War to Cold War: Churchill, Roosevelt, and the International History of the 1940s. </em>Oxford University Press, 2007, 364 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ An anthology of nearly a score of the historian’s articles on the 1940s, in chronological order, shows how the world of diplomacy was radically changed during the war and postwar years. One of the six parts is a valuable argument for why it made sense to fight on in 1940, rather than seek a withdrawal from the contest. Reynolds, however, thinks Churchill was over-optimistic in expecting this would quickly bring American into the war. —Michael Richards<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Toye, Richard. <em>Lloyd George and Churchill: Rivals for Greatness</em>. London: Macmillan, 2007, 504 pp. Reprints, softbound. </strong>✸ Although mostly pro-Lloyd George, neither protagonist emerges well. The Welshman remained the leading holdout from Churchill&#8217;s 1940 coalition government, but WSC forgave him and offered him an earldom in 1944. —RML</p>

<p><strong>Austin, Douglas. <em>Churchill and Malta: A Special Relationship</em>. Stroud, Glos.: Spellmount, 2008, 226 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-and-malta-douglas-austin/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A chronology of Churchill’s visits to and relationship with the Mediterranean island from his first encounter in 1896 to the Second World War, when Malta staged a heroic defense. Though he spent only an aggregate two weeks there, Churchill visited six times, and held Malta’s resistance glorious. Foreword by Martin Gilbert, who writes that the book provides “both true history and high drama.” —Deborah W. Nutter</p>
<p><strong>Baker, Nicholson. <em>Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, the End of Civilization. </em>New York: Simon and Schuster, 2008. Reprints. </strong>✸ Baker’s non-book offers, at best, disjointed fragments of the truth. In the words of my 18-year-old grandson, the fragments “read like beat poet Allen Ginsberg writing history for <em>USA Today</em>, only without the goofy graphics.” Churchill, the villain, can do no right. His alleged wish to starve Jews was worse than Hitler, who simply wanted them dead. Churchill never wanted to starve them at all. To pretend otherwise is ludicrous, but then, as Baker explains in an interview: “I used Wikipedia during the writing of the book, especially to check facts.” —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Bar-Noi, Uri. <em>The Cold War and Soviet Mistrust of Churchill’s Pursuit of Detente 1955.</em> Brighton, Sussex and Portland, Ore.: Academic Press, 2008, 238 pp. </strong>✸ Soviet archives has allowed several historians to re-examine Anglo-Soviet relations during Churchill’s peacetime administration. Bar-Noi is best when explaining why Churchill’s efforts to end the Cold War with a “summit” (1951-55) were resisted in Moscow. A work worthy of contemplation. —AC</p>
<p><strong>Buchanan, Patrick, J. <em>Churchill, Hitler, and the Unnecessary War: How Britain Lost Its Empire and the West Lost the World.</em> New York: Crown Publishers, 2008, 518 pp. </strong>✸ A problem illustrated by this book is the rampant use of selective quotes to distort the facts and to fit a predetermined mindset. Churchill was enthusiastic to fight when the Great War came; therefore, he is a warmonger. The German Kaiser was a noble prince; therefore, he was badly misunderstood. Hitler never wanted to go to war with Britain; therefore he was goaded by Churchill. Hitler never wanted the Jews….what? Dead? This is an entertaining polemic by a good writer, whose preconceived notions prevented him from representing reality. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Clarke, Peter. <em>The Last Thousand Days of the British Empire: Churchill, Roosevelt, and the Birth of the Pax Americana. </em>New York: Bloomsbury; London: Allen Lane, 2008, 560 pp. </strong>✸ The author marshals numerous letters and diaries from the major figures in the Empire’s decline. He offers a forensic analysis of American influence, which was at once pro-Britain and anti-Empire (an impossible thing to be?) As such, we are shown when and how, very quickly, America came to supplant Britain as the leading Western power. —Michael Richards</p>
<p><strong>Courtinat, Roland. <em>Les accords secrets Pétain-Churchill [The Secret Pétain-Churchill Agreements] (octobre-novembre 1940).</em> Coulommiers: Dualpha, 2008, 100 pp., text in French. </strong>✸ If such there were, it would surprise us. A review of this title would be most welcome.</p>

Translations: French. </strong>✸ D’Este has given us the lion not only in winter, but at war: impetuous, brazen, misguided, but indefatigable, indomitable and magnanimous: the greatest and most energetic generalissimo of the 20th century. —<em>Boston Globe</em></p>
<p><strong>Duchesne, Jacques (Saint-Denis, Michel). <em>Deux jours avec Churchill [Two Days with Churchill], Londres, 21 octobre 1940, Paris, 11 novembre 1944. </em>LaTour d’Aigues: de Aube, 2008, 78 pp.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Freudenberg, Graham. <em>Churchill and Australia.</em> Sydney: Pan Macmillan, 614 pp. </strong>✸ The author really tells the story of Australia and Britain, not specifically Churchill. Its lesson, he says, “is how much, in the final analysis, we [Australians] must rely upon ourselves. And, of course, the lesson of his whole life: ‘Never Despair.’” That said, there is no more comprehensive survey of UK-Australia wartime relations, sometimes fraught, and between Churchill and Prime Ministers Menzies and Curtin. A standard work. —RML<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Giblin, James Cross. <em>Did Fleming Rescue Churchill? </em>New York: Holt, 2008, 64 pp. </strong>✸ Juvenile for ages 8-12. The story of a 5th grade student confronted with an old canard. Supposedly Alexander Fleming saved Churchill twice: from drowning in a bog as a youth, and from pneumonia with his invention, penicillin, in 1943. The student refers to the internet and quickly gets to the bottom of the story all by himself. Good reading. —Michael Richards<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Herman, Arthur. <em>Gandhi and Churchill: The Epic Rivalry That Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age.</em> New York: Bantam Books; London: Hutchinson, 2008, 722 pp. </strong>✸ Cutting through decades of shallow reporting, Arthur Herman offers a balanced and elegant account of two famous personages, which captures both Churchill’s generosity of spirit and Gandhi’s greatness of soul. While recognizing their faults, he shows what motivated them and made them great—with impressive research which leaves “no stone unturned, no cutlet uncooked.” The last two chapters, and the author’s conclusion, are alone worth the price of what has proven to be the most comprehensive work on the subject. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Ive, Ruth. <em>The Woman Who Censored Churchill. </em>Stroud: History Press, 2008, 136 pp. </strong>✸ The only way Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt could communicate directly long-distance was the transatlantic telephone. Mechanically it had its moments—Churchill liked to bang the receiver on his desk when connections were bad, not enhancing communications. Worse, Ruth Ive was the stenographer assigned to cutting him off if he ventured into classified subjects—a task which did not endear her to the Prime Minister. Entertaining and fun. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Kelly, C. Brian. <em>Best Little Stories from the Life and Times of Winston Churchill.</em> Nashville, Tenn.: Cumberland House, 2008, 430 pp. “Best Little Stories” series. </strong>✸ When a journeyman writer adds Churchill to a vast repertoire one doesn’t expect much, but Kelly has done an excellent job, affording a glimpse of Churchill for young readers without falling for old canards and tall tales, relying on Martin Gilbert and other top experts to back up his two dozen tales, two-thirds from the Second World War; together with a 50-page account of his mother, Lady Randolph, written by Ingrid Kelly. —Michael Richards<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Kershaw, Ian. <em>Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions That Changed the World, 1940-1941.</em> London: Penguin, 2008, 600 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ The acclaimed Hitler biographer offers a blockbuster account of key decisions by war leaders: Britain’s decision to fight on in May 1940; Mussolini’s decision to attack Greece; Stalin’s decision to trust Hitler in 1939; Japan’s decisions to expand southward and to go to war with the United States; Roosevelt’s decisions to help Britain and to wage undeclared war against Germany; Hitler’s decisions to attack Russia, to declare war on the USA and to commit genocide in Europe. An amazing commentary on irrationality, which ought to be read by modern decision-makers before they do something stupid. Again. —RML<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Knight, Nigel.<em> Churchill: The Greatest Briton Unmasked.</em> Newton Abbot: David and Charles, 2008, 320 pp. Republished as <em>Churchill Reappraised, </em></strong><strong>softbound.</strong> ✸ In his assessment of Winston Churchill’s political career, Nigel Knight challenges the sentimental image of the great wartime leader and argues that Churchill’s impact on Great Britain was, in fact, consistently disastrous. Lots of room for inveighing here. It’s possible that Knight just doesn’t know much about Hitler or the Nazis—a flaw which tends to put a Churchill biographer at a disadvantage. —Michael McMenamin</p>
<p><strong>Makins, Clifford; Langworth, Richard M.; and Churchill, Winston S. <em>The Happy Warrior: The Life Story of Sir Winston Churchill, as Told Through Great Britain’s Eagle Comic of the 1950s.</em> Delray Beach, Fla.: Levenger Press, 2008, 96 pp. </strong>✸ A luxurious reissue of the 1958 edition, finely printed with precise color register, with a foreword by Langworth and afterword by Sir Winston’s grandson.</p>
<p><strong>Langworth, Richard, M., ed.</strong> <strong><em>Churchill by Himself: The Definitive Collection of Quotations. </em>London: Ebury Press; New York: Public Affairs, 2008, 656 pp. Revised and republished: see <em>Churchill in His Own Words</em> (2012). </strong>✸ Over 4000 quotations in 34 chapters from “Immortal Words” to “At Large,” and an appendix of “Red Herrings” falsely attributed to Churchill. “Cross references clarify, correlate, quote, refer, contextualize, and sometimes take a wider view in an objective, non-partisan fashion. One therefore cannot tell—and rightly so—whether he is a Left or Right Churchillian, only that his erudition is immense. With these judicious notes, he is the Virgil to the reader’s Dante.” —Manfred Weidhorn</p>
<p><strong>Rankin, Nicholas. <em>Churchill’s Wizards: The British Genius for Deception 1914-1945. </em>London: Faber and Faber, 2008, 704 pp. </strong>✸ Described: “How the British won two world wars by conning the Kaiser, hoaxing Hitler and bluffing their way out of trouble. Pretend German radio stations, broken German secret codes, eavesdropping; every German spy in Britain was captured and many were used to send back false information to their controllers.” This book may not really fit here, since it seems to use Churchill only to enhance the title.</p>
<p><strong>Reid, Walter. <em>Churchill 1940-1945: Under Friendly Fire</em>. Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2008, 416 pp. </strong>✸ The alternative title “…Fighting with Allies” appears to be an advance title for this work. The author explains how Churchill had to fight the war on one hand while holding off his friends on the other. A thoughtful examination of WSC’s relations with Chamberlain, Halifax, Roosevelt, de Gaulle and Brooke, among others. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Rhys-Jones, Graham. <em>Churchill and the Norway Campaign 1940. </em>Barnsley: Pen and Sword Military, 2008, 240 pp. </strong>✸ Examines Britain’s response to Hitler’s April 1940 surprise invasion of Norway, an ill-fated campaign for which Churchill took less blame than he might have had, were it not that he was increasingly seen as Chamberlain’s successor. Explains the frequent shifts in civilian authority over the military, which was more inclined to take risks than the politicians were. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Roberts, Andrew. </strong><strong><em>Masters and Commanders: How Four Titans Won the War in the West, 1941-45. </em></strong><strong>London: Allen Lane, 2008, 736 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ This biographical account of the Second World War features four mighty figures: Churchill, Roosevelt and their commanders Brooke and Marshall. Each was exceptionally tough-willed and strong-minded, and each of them was certain that he best knew how to win the war. The result was often an epic squabble, yet it was a tribute to the Allies that they worked out their differences and pressed on. Solidly researched and infinitely readable. —RML</p>

<p><strong>Weigold, Auriol. <em>Churchill, Roosevelt and India: Propaganda During World War II. </em>“Studies in Modern History” series. New York: Routledge, 2008, 210 pp. </strong>✸ While Churchill had spoken in favor of Indian independence as early as 1918, he stoutly resisted it as long as he judged there could never be fairness and fair-play to India’s many minorities and lower caste Hindus. Weigold tracks Churchill’s propaganda efforts to bring American opinion to his point of view. They were not very successful. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Young, John W. <em>The Foreign Policy of Churchll&#8217;s Peaetime Administration 1951-55. </em>Leicester: Leicester University Press, 1988, 274 pp.  ✸ </strong>Scholarly essays on U.S. and Soviet relations, Europen defense, the Schuman Plan, Egypt and Suez, the Baghdad Pact, South Africa, and the Korean and Vietnam Wars.<em>Contributors</em>: Anthony Adamthwaite, G.R.

Barnsley: Pen and Sword Aviation, 2009, 364 pp. Also e-book: </strong>✸ Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding created Fighter Command and led it to triumph in the Battle of Britain, not without backbiting criticism within the RAF. Churchill erupted when Dowding was shuffled into retirement, but went along with it. Dixon explains why Dowding was shabbily treated, offering the suggestion that this was not one of WSC’s finest hours. —Max E. Hertwig</p>

Translations: Finnish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish. </strong>✸ Reads like Greek tragedy: the hero is pure, but he is doomed by forces far superior to his poor mortal’s endeavors. WSC’s doomed attempt to preserve Britain’s status as a great power was only partially due to his personal faults and mistakes. Hastings recites the cliché “giant among pygmies,” but adds his own thoughtful observation. Churchill exercised “the privileges of a dictator without casting off the mantle of a democrat.” —AC</p>
<p><strong>Havardi, Jeremy. <em>The Greatest Briton: Essays on Winston Churchill’s Life and Philosophy. </em>London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 2009, 432 pp. Reprints. ✸  </strong>More from a philosophical than a historical perspective, Havardi comprehensively reviews Churchill’s notable achievements and<br/>
persistent myths. A bit over-long, not original, and hindered by some date and factual errors, this<br/>
nevertheless is a serious and fair-minded evaluation. —WJS</p>

<p><strong>Jenkins, Stanley C. <em>Winston Churchill, Oxfordshire Hussar. </em>Lydney, Glos.: Lightmoor Press, 2009, 64 pp. </strong>✸ Published to accompany a Woodstock exhibition about Churchill’s service as part-time soldier. It attempts to offer a history of his regiment, the Queen’s Own Oxfordshire Hussars, and at such a brief lengthy, fails entirely. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Johnson, Paul. <em>Churchill. </em>New York: Viking; London: Penguin, 2009, 176 and 190 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Among Churchill “brief lives,” Johnson’s ties Paul Addison’s as the best book one can read short of 200 pages. Johnson crisply dismisses the outrageous and preposterous while highlighting the truth: that WSC really <em>was</em> indispensable to that time and that hour. “Of all the towering figures both good and evil,” Churchill was “the most valuable to humanity, and also the most likable. It is a joy to write about his life and to read about it.” —RML</p>

Translations: Russian. </strong>✸ A “tasting menu” of the wittiest remarks from the editor’s <em>Churchill by Himself</em>. Indexing such a book, as he admits, is very difficult, but the quotes are short and punchy and the chapter groupings work quite well. I intend to take this lovely little book and dig out of it the perfect epigram for every speech I give or chapter I write. —Warren F. Kimbal<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Maloubier, Bob and Rossigneux, Brigitte. <em>Les coups tordus de Churchill [Churchill’s Twisted Blows]. </em>Paris: Calmann-Lévy, 2009, 268 pp. </strong>✸ Not a serious book on Churchill, only a string of stories, some very far from accurate. The authors seem determined to comb the fever swamps for tall tales: WSC’s scurrilous ancestors, war crimes, hate for this group or that, etc. No doubt it will entertain those of puny intellects in public-bar conversations, but otherwise a waste of time. —AC</p>

<p><strong>Shovel, Binden (pseudonym?). <em>Churchill’s Secret Skills. </em>London: Kernel and Warden [self-published], 2009, 250 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ Ostensibly a Churchill-based self-help guide for businessmen, filled with gibberish, stunningly obvious observations, and a guffaw-inducing contrast between Churchill’s leadership and the author’s. Reissued, incredibly, as “…American Idol” in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Stossel, Clifford Alain. <em>Churchill and de Gaulle: The Greatest Allies. </em>Privately published, 2009, 340 pp. </strong>✸ No index, no notes, no references and many errors show all the signs of a self-published book.

In this deeply researched volume, the story of Malta’s heroic struggle is told through Churchill’s official Malta Papers and the vitality of Malta’s role in supporting the Allied efforts. —Deborah W. Nutter<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Bence-Jones, Gillian. <em>Winston: A Verse Biography (To a Brave Man Who Led a Brave People).</em> London: Tlink, 2010, 60 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ An elderly resident of East Anglia offers a tribute in blank verse, skillfully weaving in events and people from Churchill’s life, and memorable snatches from his speeches. In between are her own memories of growing up in Churchill’s time—a privilege. Unique and effective. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Catherwood, Christopher. <em>His Finest Hour: A Biography of Winston Churchill. </em>New York: Skyhorse, 2010, 272 pp. </strong>✸ Like the author’s previous works, this one recycles too many spurious charges, many long dismissed, in a quest to find Churchill’s feet of clay. There is plenty to find, and fastidious historians have explored them in detail. But not here, where we are quickly at sea over subjects that should be <em>de rigueur </em>for Churchill scholars. Far better are legitimate critics such as Paul Addison, Ian Wood and John Keegan. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Clews, Graham T. <em>Churchill’s Dilemma: The Real Story Behind the Origins of the 1915 Dardanelles Campaign</em>. Santa Barbara, Calif.: Praeger, 2010, 344 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Exhaustive examination of a failure attached to Churchill. Critical of WSC, Clews assigns equal blame to Kitchener. The Dardanelles, he argues, was intended by WSC as a stepping stone to a more ambitious amphibious operation to knock out Germany, most likely via the island of Borkum. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Giuliani-Balestrino, Ubaldo. <em>Il carteggio Churchill-Mussolini alla luce del processo Guareschi [The Churchill-Mussolini File in Light of the Guareschi Trial],</em> 2010, 224 pp. Rome: Edizioni Settimo. </strong>✸ The ongoing stream of pure-fiction about Churchill’s letters offering peace to Mussolini. The title refers to the first appearance of the “letters” in 1954, when editor Giovanni Guareschi published them in <em>Candido</em> magazine. Poorly written without even attempting to illustrate the obvious fakes, this can safely be consigned to nonsense. —Patrizio Giangreco<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Harbutt, Fraser J. <em>Yalta 1945. </em>Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010, 438 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ The author argues that the Cold War might have been forestalled if postwar arrangements had not been so much influenced by “Roosevelt’s well-intentioned universalism.” This is certainly arguable, but by 1945 much of the postwar settlement was beyond dispute.</p>
<p><strong>Langworth, Richard M., ed. <em>The Patriot’s Churchill: An Inspiring Collection of Churchill’s Finest Words. </em>London: Ebury Press, 2010, 192 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ Churchill’s words on patriotic themes, distilled from the editor’s <em>Churchill by Himself,</em> all entries reliably attributed and sourced. The quotations “get to the root of what we think, rarely enough, of patriotism,” says the editor. “Churchill, of course, thought of it frequently. But that was another time.” —PHC<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Leaming, Barbara. <em>Churchill Defiant: Fighting On: 1945-1955. </em>New York: HarperCollins, 2010, 368 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ The personal dimension helps make this the most important survey of Churchill’s last active decade. Valuable to those new to Churchill for its keen insight into his lifelong defiance of long odds and formidable adversaries. No footnotes, lots of speech paraphrasing allow Leaming to get to the kernel of WSC in those years, and his final goal, the quest for peace. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Lee, Celia and Lee, John. <em>The Churchills: A Family Portrait. </em>London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, 288 pp. </strong>✸ Emphasizes the role of Churchill’s parents and brother and their family relationships.

<p><strong>McCullough, David. <em>In the Dark Streets Shineth: A 1941 Christmas Eve Story</em>. Salt Lake City: Shadow Mountain, 2010, 56 pp. </strong>✸ Condemned by some reviewers as narcissistic (it includes a DVD of a McCullough broadcast as well as Churchill and Roosevelt lighting the White House Christmas tree), this is really a touching reiteration of that well-known occasion. —Michael Richards</p>
<p><strong>Mukerjee, Madhusree. <em>Churchill’s Secret War: The British Empire and the Ravaging of India during World War II.</em> New York: Basic Books, 2010, 368 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churcills-secret-war-bengal-famine-1943/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: One could say of <em>Churchill’s Secret War</em> that it is neither a secret nor a war, nor has it much to do with Churchill. Mukerjee, who is no historian, gets herself entangled in three separate and contentious issues: Britain’s battle with Indian nationalists, Churchill’s often tempestuous views on India, and the 1943-44 Bengal famine. She attempts to build a plausible cause-and-effect narrative, but manages only to mangle the facts regarding all three, doing a disservice to both historical and moral truth. —Arthur Herma<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Nông, Văn Dân. <em>Churchill, Eden, and Indo-China, 1951-55</em>. New York: Anthem Press, 2010, 390 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ A Hanoi professor applies Vietnamese, French and English documents to the study of how the fall of Dien Bien Phu, and British reluctance to become involved, led to the division of Vietnam at the 1955 Geneva conference. An obscure page in Churchill historiography. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Perry, John. <em>Winston Churchill.</em> Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2010, 166 pp. “Christian Encounters” series. </strong>✸ An attempt, not very successful, to describe Churchill’s spiritual life, which gets caught on his many contradictory statements and gets many essential facts wrong. —PHC<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Price, Bill, <em>Winston Churchill War Leader. </em>Harpenden, Herts.: Pocket Essentials, 2010, 160 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ A 45,000-word pocket softback, not about the war leader but a mini-biography with no new quotations and a handful of inaccuracies. Nice enough as it goes, but lays enough eggs to send readers to far better brief lives by Addison and Best. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Rubinstein, Christopher. <em>Royal Flourish. </em>London: Grosvenor House, 2010, 302 pp. </strong>✸ Despite his photo on the cover, Churchill appears rarely in this book, which was written to float a far-out conspiracy that the British government was behind Hess’s May 1941 flight to Scotland, where he was promptly interred. Just another Hess canard. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Spencer-Lewis Leonard (pseudonym). <em>Winston Churchill: An American Idol: The X-Factors That Prove the Greatest Briton Had Talent. </em>London: Kernel and Warden [self-published], 2010, 250 pp. softbound. </strong>✸ A reissue of <em>Churchill’s Secret Skills</em> (2009) as a mock self-help guide. The truly awful English is relieved only by the truly splendid English of WSC, who is quoted admiringly. Paraphrasing Churchill, we like the martial and commanding air with which the author treats apostrophes. He stands no nonsense from them. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Toye, Richard. <em>Churchill’s Empire: The World That Made Him and the World He Made. </em>New York: Holt; St. Martin’s Griffin, 2010, 448 pp. London: Macmillan, 2016. Reprints.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wells, Mike. <em>Churchill 1920-45. </em>London: Heinemann, 2010, 190 pp. “OCR A-Level History” series. </strong>Although uneven in coverage, this study guide informs British A-Level students about Churchill’s most important twenty-five years with a more balanced appraisal than he is likely to get in today’s more politicized atmosphere. It shows how to appreciate both sides of an argument and encourages students make up their own minds. Refreshing. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>White-Smith, Heather. <em>My Years with the Churchills: A Young Girl’s Memories. </em>N. Carrollton, Miss.: Cotesworth, 2010, 64 pp. </strong>✸ The author was hired to assist with Clementine Churchill’s correspondence, but aside from a few anecdotes she offers, there is little that is new. The author apparently doesn’t recall the scary time of his 1953 stroke, or the efforts to keep it a secret from the public. —Michael Richards</p>
<h3><strong>2011</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Batty, Peter. <em>Hoodwinking Churchill: Tito’s Great Confidence Trick.</em> London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 2011, 384 pp. </strong>✸ Like most conspiracy theories, Batty’s is not all wrong: Tito and his British supporters <em>did</em> help convince Churchill to aid his communist partisans. But WSC made his own decisions based on evidence, and it insults the memory of his envoy to Tito, Sir Fitzroy Maclean, to claim he was hoodwinked. “Conspiracy” doesn’t explain everything. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Downing, Taylor. <em>Churchill’s War Lab: Code Breakers, Scientists, and the Mavericks Churchill </em></strong><strong><em>Led to Victory.</em></strong> New York: Overlook Press, 2011. 416 pp. ✸ Masterfully contends that World War II generated and Churchill encouraged more incredible ideas, technical advances, and scientific leaps than any other conflict. From radar to the decoding brilliance of Bletchley Park, these were the core of Britain’s victory. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Edgerton, David. <em>Britain’s War Machine: Weapons, Resources, and Experts in the Second World War.</em> London: Allen Lane, 2011, 464 pp. </strong>✸ A revisionist interpretation of Britain and Churchill in the Second World War, critiquing British historiography and examining Churchill beyond the “Hero of 1940.” It argues that Britain was a “warfare state” before a “welfare state,” prioritizing military capability, especially research and development. Led by the “technological visionary” Churchill, Britain was a well-armed country commanding a global economic system. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Groth, Alexander J. <em>Accomplices: Churchill, Roosevelt and the Holocaust, 2011, </em>308 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ An outrageous conspiracy potboiler contending that the Big Two knew about and did nothing to stop the Holocaust, as if they had plenary authority and fighting for survival was secondary. For reality, read Martin Gilbert’s <em>Auschwitz and the Allies. </em>—RML</p>
<p><strong>Hart, Peter, <em>Gallipoli. </em>Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, 560 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ A straightforward denunciation of the Dardanelles-Gallipoli campaign as ill-conceived and doomed to failure, taking little account of the nuances, close calls and might-have-beens. —PHC<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Jackson, Ashley. <em>Churchill. </em>London: Quercus, 2011, 424 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ A professor of military history advances the scholarship with and outstanding medium-length biography. While not 100% approving, Jackson dismisses the radical dismissals of a WSC resistant to modern developments who died sad and disappointed. “This interpretation,” Jackson writes, “reflects a desperately ageist and teleological way of looking at things and focuses entirely on the negative.”<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Langworth, Richard M., ed. <em>All Will Be Well: Good Advice from Winston Churchill.</em> London: Ebury Press, 2011, 160 pp. </strong>✸ In troubled times, to whom better to turn to for reassurance? Distilled from <em>Churchill by Himself </em>are famous and inspiring words, that warmed the hearts of badly pressed peoples. Witty, dry, rousing, wise, his words are an antidote to modern stresses and strains. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Legg, Rodney. <em>Winston Churchill. </em>London: Pixz, 2011, 64 pp. </strong>✸ Cheap and cheerful, likely to be found in gift shops related to Churchill, but better than the average, because Legg has done his homework and avoids falling for the usual canards. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Lovell, Mary S. <em>The Churchills in Love and War.</em> New York: Little Brown, 2011, 672 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ A popular history that begins with John Churchill, first Duke of Marlborough, and his enduring marriage to Sarah Jennings, courtesan to Queen Anne. Of their descendants, only Winston and Clementine had a comparable marriage. The other Churchills come off badly, especially Winston’s father Lord Randolph. Winston’s cousin, “Sunny,” the 9th Duke, had two disastrous marriages, while Winston’s son Randolph is portrayed as a drunken womanizer. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Mawdsley, Evan. <em>December 1941: Twelve Days That Began a World War.</em> New Haven: Yale University Press, 2011, 360 pp.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quinault, Roland. <em>British Prime Ministers and Democracy: From Disraeli to Blair</em>. London: Continuum, 2011, 302 pp. Reprints, softbound, e-book. </strong>✸ An examination of the role of democracy in the governments of ten prominent modern prime ministers, with a chapter on Churchill recycled from a 2001 article. Quinault’s premiers were selected for contributions “to the evolution of modern British politics.” He uses the democratic credentials of the nine PMs from Disraeli to Thatcher to eviscerate the tenth, Tony Blair, who “took the name of democracy in vain” with his autocratic rule at home and bloody wars abroad. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Soames, Mary. <em>A Daughter’s Tale: The Memoirs of Winston and Clementine Churchill’s Youngest Child.</em> London: Transworld, 2011; New York: Random House, 2012, 416 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Churchill’s youngest daughter recounts her first 25 years, 1922-1947. “Assuredly it is one of the great documents of history, that someday may be a major resource for historians. In the meantime, <em>A Daughter’s Tale</em> is a most illuminating portrait of the early life of a remarkable woman who was truly a worthy offspring.” —John G. Plumpton</p>
<p><strong>Smith, T.O. <em>Churchill, America and Vietnam 1940-45. </em>New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, 200 pp. </strong>✸ An American academic distills all there is, and there is not much, on Churchill’s concerns over Vietnam, which tended to be obscure and not often expressed. Eden, Smith says, took more of an interest, wanting to retain a close alliance with France. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Ståhlberg, Knut. <em>Två kära ovänner [Two Dear Enemies]: Churchill och de Gaulle. </em>Stockholm, Norsteds, 2011, 340 pp. Text in Swedish. </strong>✸ Except for non-English-speaking Swedes, this book adds nothing new, though it quotes adroitly from letters and scholarly studies to give a balanced report on the two friendly-enemies. Most valuable is a timeline of encounters from Syria 1941 to WSC’s funeral. —AC</p>
<p><strong>Stelzer, Cita. <em>Dinner with Churchill: Policy-Making at the Dinner Table</em>. London: Short Books, 2011, 302 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Uniquely to date, the author shows how Churchill used fine cuisine to advance policy. Section 1 includes meals during the 1940s, all over the world in multiple venues. Section 2 explains what Churchill ate and drank, interlaced with his humor, curiosity and zest. The final chapter is on rationing, a wartime challenge. —Barbara F. Langworth</p>
<p><strong>Weintraub, Stanley. <em>Pearl Harbor Christmas: A World at War, 1941. </em>Cambridge, Mass.: Da Capo Press, 2011, 240 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ The 70th anniversary of Pearl Harbor occasioned several books not specifically on Churchill. Neither is this, ostensibly, but Weintraub concentrates deeply on WSC’s reaction to events and snap trip to Washington. Not without criticism, the book offers compelling reading. —RML</p>
<h3><strong>2012</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ball, Celwyn. <em>Churchill World Stamp Catalogue. </em>New Brunswick: self-published, 2012, 218 pp., spiral bound. </strong>✸ The ultimate catalogue of Churchill commemorative stamps by a lifetime collector, including local-post issues, all the spurious Arab Trucial State semi-stamps, and hundreds of real ones. This is the only listing of every issue from 1945 (yes, even back then) through 2012. A pox on Scott Stamp Catalogues for refusing to allow use of their numbering system. How much would that have cost them? —RML</p>
<p><strong>Baxendale, Alan S. <em>Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill: Penal Reformer. </em>Originally titled <em>Before the Wars: Churchill as Reformer (1910-1911).</em> New York: Peter Lang, 2012, 232 pp. </strong>✸ A foreword by Martin Gilbert notes that Baxendale has gone deeper into Churchill’s prison reforms as Home Secretary than anyone to date. WSC wasn’t always right, sometimes spectacularly wrong—but he made his mark. Essential reading on this topic. —PHC<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Bell, Christopher M. <em>Churchill and Sea Power.</em> New York: Oxford University Press, 2012, 430 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Necessary new scholarship on an old subject, based on sources old and new, puncturing many misstatements from the past. Bell concludes: “Churchill understood the navy’s capabilities and its limitations better than probably any other politician of this period. The nation was fortunate that he was so frequently and prominently involved.” —RML</p>
<p><strong>Botham, Noel and Montague, Bruce. <em>Catch That Tiger: Churchill’s Secret Order That Launched the Most Astounding and Dangerous Mission of World War II</em>. London: John Blake, 2012, 228 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Ostensibly about engineer Major Douglas Lidderdale’s mission to North Africa to capture a German “Tiger” tank, but without documentation except the hero’s diary and invented dialogue. Not to be taken seriously. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Castor, Harriet. <em>Winston Churchill: The Story of a Great British Statesman. </em>London: A. and C. Black, 2012, 130 pp. Softbound, e-book. </strong>✸ An excellent introduction for young people, expanded from the author’s 2002 effort and for an older audience. Castor sticks to the sources and maintains strict accuracy. —RML<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherwood, Christopher. <em>The Treasures of Winston Churchill: The Greatest Briton.</em> London: Andrew Deutsch. 2012. </strong><strong><em>All about Winston Churchill</em></strong><strong>. Indianapolis: Blue River Press, 2017, 96 pp. </strong>✸ The author previously accused Churchill of genocide in Iraq, communizing Eastern Europe and being an alcoholic “flawed genius”; now he issues what seems to be a tribute, with some novel features: four pockets, for example, of reproduction documents. But the text repeats all previous accusations using biased sidebars and unsubstantiated conjecture, interleaved with accuracies (Monty, Eden, India). You can read about all that in more objective works. —RML<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Clarke, Peter. <em>Mr. Churchill’s Profession: The Statesman as Author and the Book That Defined the “Special Relationship.”</em> New York: Bloomsbury Press, 2012, 352 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/mr-churchills-profession-the-statesman-as-author-and-the-book-that-defined-the-special-relationship-by-peter-clarke/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Neither a polemic nor a panegyric of Churchill’s literary career, especially <em>A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, </em>which Clarke considers the magnum opus, written largely by WSC himself, whereas <em>The Second World War</em> was collaboratively produced. Clarke notes that Churchill succeeded at two careers, while his father could not sustain one, and that Churchill had a great appetite for his own words. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Dilks, David. <em>Churchill and Company: Allies and Rivals in Peace and War.</em> London: Taurus, 2012, 336 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ A collection of essays with penetrating and sometimes unorthodox insights. They aim, says Dilks, “to illuminate Churchill’s activities among friends and enemies”—two hard-to-separate categories. Dilks teaches us how to appreciate Churchill because he makes us think. Circumstances matter. Judging the past by what we know now, we are obliged to consider how the players of those times had to look at things, based only on what they knew then. —RML</p>

<p><strong>Friedman, Isaiah. <em>British Miscalculations: The Rise of Muslim Nationalism 1918-1925.</em> London: Transaction Publishers, 2012, 394 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/muslim-nationalism/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A professor emeritus at Israel’s Ban-Gurion University joins David Fromkin (1989) in reminding us how much more there was to know of the Arabic and Islamic world than Churchill and the Allies were aware of or willing to admit in those frenzied and important times. Had the advice of WSC and Richard Meinertzhagen’s advice been followed, they might have crafted a more durable peace in the Middle East. —Erica L. Chenoweth</p>
<p><strong>Gilbert, Martin. <em>Churchill: The Power of Words. </em>New York: Da Capo Press, 2012, 536 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ The official biographer focuses his years of experience in the vineyard of Churchill’s words to offer passages of deep meaning to express WSC’s thoughts during the great climacterics of his life. A thoughtful book, one to keep at hand.</p>
<p><strong>Green, Edward. <em>A Little Bit of Churchill Wit. </em>Chichester, W. Sussex: Summersdale, 2012, 160 pp. </strong>✸ Full of false quotes never uttered by Churchill. If you are looking for a bite-sized stocking filler for someone in the Playstation generation, it costs less than the price of a pint of beer. —Robert Courts</p>
<p><strong>Humes, James C. <em>Churchill: The Prophetic Statesman</em>. Washington, D.C.: Regnery History, 2012, 244 pp.</strong> ✸ A Republican Presidential speechwriter, reviews the prophetic accuracy of Churchill’s prognostications culled from his writings and speeches. Humes argues that Churchill had an intuition for the impact of technological innovation and social change on war and society. While there is little new for the Churchill scholar or aficionado, the book has some potential for the general reader. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>John, Peter. <em>Churchill versus Hitler: The War of Words. </em>Birmingham: Bennion Kearny, 2012, 354 pp. Reprints, e-book. ✸ </strong>John thoughtfully asks when did each antagonist first become aware of the other’s existence, though there is no definitive answer. Unfortunately, factual errors, inadequate citation conventions, and heavy reliance on a discredited major source, not to mention the pedestrian quality of print, size, and format, give the impression of a self-published rather than a professionally produced work. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Langworth, Richard M. </strong><strong><em>Churchill in His Own Words: The Life, Times and Opinions of Winston Churchill.</em></strong><strong> London: Ebury Press, 2012, 620 pp. Reprints, e-book.</strong> ✸ A revised edition of <em>Churchill by Himself</em> (2008) adds a key word and phrase index to locate quotes and some editions and deletions based on prodigious checking and rechecking. Each of the 4120 entries is backed by reliable attribution, unlike so many smaller quote books. The “Red Herrings” appendix of quotes WSC never said is back, and expanded. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Marsh, Richard C. <em>Churchill, Flandin and Wigram: The Rest of the Story</em>. Ann Arbor, Mich.: The Triple Anvil Press, 2012, 18 pp, illustrated by Rose Jaffe.</strong> ✸ A monograph describing Pierre Flandin’s unsuccessful 1936 attempt to enlist British support to confront Nazi Germany. Also, Churchill’s assistance to Flandin during his trial after the Second World War, and Churchill’s friendship with Ralph Wigram and his wife Ava.</p>

<p><strong>Reardon, Terry. <em>Winston Churchill and Mackenzie King: So Similar, So Different. </em>Toronto: Patrick Boyer Books, 2012, 432 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ It is hard for today’s advocates of the Anglo-American special relationship to believe that there was a time when the U.S. and Britain could not talk directly to each other about substantive issues without an intermediary. That linchpin (a Churchillian term) was not Canada; it was Mackenzie King. —John G. Plumpton.</p>
<p><strong>Sandys, Celia and El Glaoui, Turia. <em>Meetings in Marrakech: The Paintings of Hassan El Glaoui and Winston Churchill. </em>Milan, Skira Editore, 2012, 72 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ A delightful collection of paintings by both artists, published to coincide with an unusual exhibition in January 2012 in London’s Leighton House. —PHC</p>
<p><strong>Selbert, Kathryn. <em>War Dogs: Churchill and Rufus. </em>Watertown, Mass.: Charlesbridge, 2012, 48 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Billed for ages 7-10, this charmer features Churchill’s beloved poodle, who accompanies him on wartime meanderings. Not least important, it includes a 1939-45 timeline, a page on “Churchill and Poodles,” “The Man Himself,” a book list, websites, a bibliography and, most happily, “Quotation Sources.” A really well-done juvenile. —Suzanne Sigman<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Singer, Barry. <em>Churchill Style: The Art of Being Winston Churchill. </em>New York: Abrams, 2012, 240 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Like most Abrams titles, this is elegant in appearance, and the author has a unique approach: nine facets of Churchill that were the essence of his style: autos, books, cigars, dining, fashion, friendships, home, imbibing, pastimes. This is a fine little book to browse forever, full color illustrations including rare first editions—an heirloom and an education. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Strange, Robert J. <em>Who Sank the </em>Titanic<em>? The Final Verdict. </em>Barnsley, Yorks.: Pen and Sword, 2012, 224 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ Unlikely to be here, but Strange blames Churchill (as President of the Board of Trade) for most of <em>Titanic</em>’s deficiencies, so…. WSC ignored the lack of lifeboats, faulty rivets, dubious steel, etc. And he would not have missed all this, were he not busy courting Clementine and angling for his next office. If only he’d been a mechanic. —Michael Richards</p>
<p><strong>Theakston, Kevin. <em>Winston Churchill. </em>London: Shire Books, 2012, 56 pp. </strong>✸ A lovely little gem that was mainly ignored and not reprinted. Theakston crisply tells the story, not ignoring the literary and family side, studding his text with fresh and colorful illustrations. Not omitted are appendices for further reading and Churchill places to visit. —PHC<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>White, Philip. <em>Our Supreme Task: How Winston Churchill’s Iron Curtain Speech Defined the Cold War Alliance</em>. New York: Public Affairs, 2012, 304 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Reviewers regarded this as a potboiler with little new to add except errors, like WSC wearing a bowler hat and Harry Vaughan as Truman’s “naval aide.” For solid analysis and perspective, turn instead to Muller (ed.), <em>Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” Speech</em> (1999). —RML</p>

<p><strong>Baker, Christopher; Dockrill, Michael L.; Hamilton, Keith, eds. <em>Britain </em><em>in Global Politics</em>, vol. 1<em>, From Gladstone to Churchill. </em>New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2013, 312 pp. </strong>✸ See below, Young et. al. for vol. 2. These academic essays are a posthumous tribute (Gedenkschrift) to Professor Saki Ruth Dockrill of King’s College.  Despite the title, they focus primarily on Appeasement, revealing bizarre mental gyrations of progressive academics attempting to salve the reputation of the right-wing Neville Chamberlain while dismissing Churchill’s accounts as self-serving, though relevant and persuasive. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Beasley, A.W. <em>Churchill: The Supreme Survivor.</em> Mells, Somerset: Mercer Books, 2013, 216 pp. </strong>✸ Churchill’s medical history needs more than 200 pages, and though this book is well-written and illustrated, it was eclipsed by the Vale/Scadding <em>Churchill’s Illnesses</em> (2020). The book does demonstrate Churchill’s hardiness, fortitude and determination. —RML<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Black, Jonathan and Ayers, Sara. <em>Abstraction and Reality: The Sculpture of Ivor Roberts-Jones. </em>London: Philip Watson, 2013, 340 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/the-sculpture-of-ivor-roberts-jones-by-jonathan-black-and-sara-ayers/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Both an elaborate coffee table book and an art history, this work celebrates the sculptor of Churchill’s best-known statue, which stands watching the Houses of Parliament. This <em>catalogue raisonné</em> documents 156 known works in bronze, plaster, clay, and terracotta, of which London’s 12-foot-high Churchill is most famous. —WJS<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Coughlin, Con. <em>Churchill’s First War: Young Winston at War with the Afghans</em>. New York: Thomas Dunn Books, St. Martin’s Press, 2013, 298 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchills-first-war-young-winston-at-war-with-the-afghans-by-con-coughlin/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A veteran reporter’s investigation of the historical context to Churchill’s first book, <em>The Story of the Malakand Field Force </em>(1898). British India developed a “forward policy” to forestall Russian influence, resulting in several wars, including a tribal revolt in what is now Pakistan. This book has many merits but also errors, such as stating that Churchill’s father was a “Tory peer.” —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Farmelo, Graham. <em>Churchill’s Bomb: How the United States Overtook Britain in the First Nuclear Arms Race. </em>New York: Basic Books, 2013, 576 pp. Also Kindle. </strong>✸ Farmelo argues that Churchill squandered Britain’s scientific lead to the Americans, in part to focus on short-term, practical military necessities. Well-written fusing of science and history, despite some idiosyncratic vocabulary: “wheezes, “cadged,” “frenemy.” No illustrations, but the book relies on many credible sources An ambivalent work tracing the development of nuclear weapons from the perspective of the mostly left-leaning scientists, along with a polemic against Churchill and Lindemann. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Freeman, Richard. <em>“Unsinkable”: Churchill and the First World Wa</em>r. Stroud, Glos.: The History Press, 272 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/unsinkable-richard-freeman/">Reviewed by Hillsda</a>le: Churchill’s remarkable fall and rise again, causing one British newspaper to dub him “the unsinkable politician,” is already chronicled by Martin Gilbert. Does any new book tell us anything more? Usually not, but Freeman adeptly highlights that only Churchill rose from the First World War prepared to fight the Second. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Frerejean, Alain. <em>Churchill et Staline. </em>Paris: Perrin, 2013, 506 pp., softbound. “Biographies croisées” [Parallel Lives] Series. Text in French. </strong>✸ A comparative biography contrasting the lives of two disparate characters, from youth (unpleasant for both) on up, converging of course in World War II. Not a bad book, with an irritating lack of footnotes, especially to Churchill expressions, and the odd howler: when Frerejean describes Churchill’s slippers as embroidered with the letters “WC.” —AC</p>
<p><strong>Irons, Roy. <em>Churchill and the Mad Mullah of Somaliland: Betrayal and Redemption 1899-1921</em>. Barnsley, Yorkshire: Pen and Sword Military, 2013, 238 pp. </strong>✸ Britain had tried four times to crush the tyrant Sayyid in Somaliland (not to be confused with the Mad Mullah in <em>The Malakand Field Force</em>) when Churchill finally convinced his Liberal colleagues to back off. British authority was withdrawn to the coast, resulting in vast slaughter. Churchill was appalled over this, but the Great War drew British priorities elsewhere. Finally, as Minister for War and Air after the war, Churchill was able to ease the plight of Somalis with the use of air power. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Marsh, Richard C. <em>Young Winston Churchill and the Last Victorian Church of England Anti-Ritual Campaign.</em> Ann Arbor, Michigan: The Triple Anvil Press, 2013, 44 pp., illustrated by Rose Jaffe.</strong> ✸ A monograph describing Churchill’s political support, early in his career, of the campaign to deritualize the Anglican Church. The campaign was led by his aunt, Lady Cornelia Wimborne.</p>
<p><strong>McNamara, Robert, ed. <em>The Churchills in Ireland 1660-1965: Connections and Controversies.</em> Newbridge, Co. Kildare: Irish Academic Press, 2013, 300 pp. </strong>✸ Collects ten essays including five on Churchill and Ireland. The best and worth reading are the editor’s account of Churchill’s historical writing about Ireland; and Michael McMenamin’s essay on WSC’s Irish-American mentor Bourke Cockran. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Orange, Vincent. <em>Churchill and His Airmen: Relationships, Intrigue and Policy Making 1914-1945. </em>London: Grub Street Publishing, 2013, 314 pp. Reprints, e-book.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Schoeman, Chris. <em>Churchill’s South Africa: Travels During the Anglo-Boar War</em>. Cape Town, South Africa: Random House Struik/Zebra Press, 2013, 224 pp. </strong>✸ A critical reevaluation of Churchill’s Boer War activities, measuring his written accounts against those of other contemporaries. Schoeman is generally accurate with facts, but suspect with interpretation as he presents the worst possible view of Churchill on any given occasion, questioning his honor and veracity with snide and irrelevant criticism. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Shelden, Michael. <em>Young Titan: The Making of Winston Churchill</em>. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2013, 400 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Shelden diverts our attention from Churchill’s iconic image with a younger man of towering but unrealized ambition, 25 to 40, who climbs a long political ladder, pulling it up after himself. Letting aside the author’s unwonted eagerness to offer new revelations about Churchill’s romances, he tells his story well, and any lapses must be balanced against the real virtues of this book. —JWM</p>
<p><strong>Toye, Richard. <em>The Roar of the Lion: The Untold Story of Churchill’s World War II Speeches.</em> Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, 310 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ Takes a new approach by analyzing Churchill’s speeches by the reaction to them, though heavily through Mass Observation, which tended to attract carpers, and confined mainly to reaction in Britain, not in America or occupied Europe. Some speeches were flops, Toye writes, while admitting Churchill’s Gallup rating was around 80%. Pretty good for a flop. —Michael Richards</p>
<p><strong>Van Wijnen, <em>Harry. ‘Blood, Sweat and Tears’: Churchills onwrikbare geloof in de overwinning [Churchill’s Unshakable Faith in Victory].</em> Amsterdam: Balans, 2013, 350 pp. Text in Dutch. </strong>✸ Author was parliamentary editor for <em>Het Parool</em>, and Professor of Media at the Erasmus University.

<p><strong>Attenborough, Wilfred. <em>Churchill and the ‘Black Dog’ of Depression: Reassessing the Biographical Evidence of Psychological Disorder</em>. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, 264 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/winston-churchill-and-the-black-dog-of-depression-by-wilfred-attenborough/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a> (followed by lengthy debate): Eventually an erudite synthesis will capture all aspects of Churchill’s personality. This book focuses almost exclusively on his depressed moods, and does not address the relevant diagnoses, such as cyclothymic personality—the opinion of his neurologist, Lord Brain. —John H. Mather</p>
<p><strong>Coleman, E.C. <em>Khaki Jack: The Royal Naval Division in the First World War. </em>Stroud, Glos.: Amberley, 2014, 256 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/khaki-jack-the-royal-naval-division-in-the-first-world-war-by-e-c-coleman/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: An examination of that brainchild in Churchill’s fertile mind, the Royal Naval Division. Unique in military history, the RND was a hybrid unit of seamen serving as infantry alongside soldiers of the British Army. The title is the nickname applied to RND personnel when an officer appeared in khaki version of a Royal Navy uniform. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Croft, Rodney J. <em>Churchill’s Final Farewell: The State and Private Funeral of Sir Winston Churchill. </em>Self-published, 2014, 170 pp. Reprints, softbound, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchills-final-farewell-rodney-j-croft/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A professionally produced book with everything we need to know about that day, 30 January 1965. Drawing on copious archival research including the Earl Marshal who organized the funeral, Croft offers an insider’s account, right down to the cost of tea and sandwiches on the train returning from the Bladon burial. —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Dix, Anthony. <em>The Norway Campaign and the Rise of Churchill. </em>Barnsley, Yorks.: Pen and Sword, 2014, 272 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ An excellent military history of a failed campaign that ended Chamberlain’s premiership and empowered Churchill, despite his naval responsibility. Dix notes that the Royal Navy inflicted catastrophic losses on the Germans, a significant though under-appreciated factor in winning the later Battle of Britain. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Glueckstein, Fred. <em>Churchill and Colonist II: The Story of Winston Churchill and His Famous Race Horse. </em>Bloomington, Ind.: iUniverse, 2014, 108 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-and-colonist-ii-the-story-of-winston-churchill-and-his-famous-race-horse-by-fred-glueckstein/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: An example of the specialized material still out there to be assembled, this account traces Churchill’s postwar interest in thoroughbred horse racing. But the author reaches back to his earliest interest in horses, as a polo-playing cavalry officer. The distinguished career of Colonist II of course dominates the story. An appendix by Katherine Thompson lists all of Churchill’s brood mares and race horses. Well done. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Hamilton, Nigel. <em>The Mantle of Command: FDR at War 1941-1942. </em>Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2014, 544 pp. Reprints, e-book, audiobook. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/the-mantle-of-command-fdr-at-war-1941-1942-by-nigel-hamilton/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The author is a partisan, but none the worse a writer for that. His multi-volume life of Montgomery set out Monty’s case for the approbation of history; his <em>American Caesars</em> lauded every recent Democrat president and lambasted every Republican. So long as you know that you are getting a passionate partisan approach, rather than truly objective history, Hamilton’s books are fine, and always highly readable. —Andrew Roberts<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hedengren, Olaf G. <em>Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. </em>Malmo: privately published, 2014, 206 pp.  ✸ </strong>Undated brief biography without endnotes, index, or even an indication of the publisher. Text in Swedish.</p>
<p><strong>Heppell, Timothy. <em>The Tories from Winston Churchill to David Cameron</em>.

Of the five main chapters Churchill appears only briefly in the first, and then fades from view. Thus it is of limited importance to Churchill scholars, though it reflects thoughtfully on his legacy. —Christopher H. Sterling</p>
<p><strong>James, Lawrence. <em>Churchill and Empire: A Portrait of an Imperialist</em>. New York: Pegasus, 2014, 456 pp. Also softbound, e-book. ✸ </strong>An imperial historian believes Churchill’s views of Anglo-Saxon superiority supported his belief in Empire as a civilizing, humanitarian force. This underpinned his strategic thinking, but left him open to 21st century charges of opposing independence and human rights. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Johnson, Boris. <em>The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History. </em>London: Hodder and Stoughton, 2014, 416 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/boris-johnson-churchill-factor/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Perhaps more interesting in retrospect, given the high office the author later achieved, this is a colorful, irrepressible, and sometimes absurd appreciation of Sir Winston. A breezy joy-ride through familiar territory, allegedly written to help the young admire WSC as much as the old, with a little too many apocryphal stories. A BBC commentator remarked: “The trouble with Winston Churchill is that he thinks he’s Boris Johnson.” —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Mallinson, Allen. <em>1914, Fight the Good Fight: Britain, the Army and the Coming of the First World War. </em>London: Bantam, 2014, 624 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/1914-fight-the-good-fight-britain-the-army-the-coming-of-the-first-world-war-by-allen-mallinson/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Outstanding among many books on the centenary of the Great War, this work acquits Churchill of the charge of war-mongering and points out the enormous sense of responsibility that rested on him, with a finely-developed of Britain’s ancient role in balancing power in Europe. Mallinson also rejects the fashionable post-modernist view that all European Great Powers were equally to blame for the tragedy. Instead he rightly fastens the blame solely where it ought to belong, on the Central Powers. —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Maier, Thomas. <em>When Lions Roar: The Churchill&#8217;s and the Kennedys. </em>New York: Crown, 2014, 788 pp.</strong> ✸ A readable book, elegantly written, which commits some errors. It contains much that is known, though Maier the Joe Kennedy-Churchill relationship is reliably tracked back to 1933. Worth reading for the lyrical prose and charming touching vignettes involving WSC and Jack Kennedy. —<a href="https://richardlangworth.com/churchills-kennedys" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://richardlangworth.com/churchills-kennedys', 'RML');">RML</a></p>
<div><strong>Marsh, Richard C. <em>Churchill and Macaulay.</em> Ann Arbor, Michigan: The Triple Anvil Press, 2014, 22 pp., illustrated by Rose Jaffe.</strong> A monograph describing Churchill&#8217;s efforts to refute criticism of his great ancestor John Churchill, First Duke of Marlborough, by the Victorian historian Thomas Babington Macaulay. In the 1930s, his interest led Churchill to write <em>Marlborough: His Life and Tmes.</em></div>
<p><strong>Potter, John. <em>Pim and Churchill’s Map Room: Based on the Papers of Captain Richard Pim RNVA, Supervisor of Churchill’s War Room 1939-45. </em>Belfast: Northern Ireland War Memorial, 2014, 76 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/pim-churchills-map-room-john-potter/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: This fine little book distills Captain Pim’s memoirs, which are lodged in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland. Expertly compiled, it offers charming vignettes of what it was like to work for Churchill, as Pim saw him on an almost daily basis and travelled with him to almost all the wartime conferences. —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Rose, Jonathan. <em>The Literary Churchill: Author, Reader, Actor. </em>New Haven: Yale University Press, 2014, 528 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/the-literary-churchill-by-jonathan-rose/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: More yet less: A biography which sometimes strays from Churchill’s life as a man of letters, <em>vide</em> the dull prose of Britain’s Mass Observation polling during the Second World War, or his lengthy account of Churchill’s influence on John F. Kennedy at the end. Yet although Rose touches on Churchill’s literary works, his treatment of most is sketchy, his view distorted by seeing them through his melodramatic prism. —James W. Muller</p>
<p><strong>Smith, Gregory Bell. <em>The American Ancestry of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. </em>Privately published, 2014, 194 pp.</strong> ✸ A thoroughgoing work of genealogy tracking every United States ancestor of Sir Winston, to whom the author is related through at least six families. A reference work and significant contribution to the scholarship. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Thornton, Martin. <em>Churchill, Borden and Anglo-Canadian Naval Relations 1911-14. </em>London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, 188 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-borden-and-anglo-canadian-naval-relations-by-martin-thornton/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill’s Admiralty had a sympathetic ally in Canadian Premier Sir Robert Borden, who supplied the cost ($35 million) of three Dreadnoughts in exchange for British contracts in Canadian shipyards. This arrangement, with promising benefit to all, fell afoul of Canadian politics, leaving Churchill shorthanded. The failure was not Churchill’s; it lay deep in Canada’s politics. Despite its formidable price tag, this book is well researched and recommended reading for students of the subject. —Barry Gough</p>
<p><strong>Tolppanen, Bradley P. <em>Churchill in North America, 1929: A Three Month Tour of Canada and the United States</em>. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2014, 272 pages. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/tolppanen-north-america-1929/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A deeply researched and well-written account of the Churchill brothers and their sons on their only major holiday together, touring North America’s sights, sounds and personalities in the warning days before the Great Depression. A model for specialized year-studies, alongside David Stafford’s monograph on 1921 (2019). —RML</p>
<p><strong>Wilson, Cat. <em>Churchill on the Far East in The Second World War: Hiding the History of the “Special Relationship.” </em>Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, 278 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-far-east-second-world-war-cat-wilson/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A solid and long overdue scholarly exercise, it will be read mainly by specialist historians, since the editing did little to loosen the dense language, appropriate to a dissertation but a barrier to anyone but specialists; and it is overpriced. —Raymond A. Callahan</p>
<h3><strong>2015</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Apps, Peter. <em>Churchill in the Trenches. </em>Self-published </strong><strong>softbound</strong><strong>, 2015, 138 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-trenches-peter-apps/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Though it relates the familiar anecdotes of Churchill’s military service, this self-published work ultimately relies too much on other sources, and suffers from a lack of editing or editorial content. In no way unfair to Churchill, it does not amplify, only reflects, Martin Gilbert’s work—or that of Douglas Russell’s <em>Winston Churchill, Soldier</em> (2008). —WJS<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Arnold, Michael. <em>Hollow Heroes: An Unvarnished Look at the Wartime Careers of Churchill, Montgomery and Mountbatten</em>. Philadelphia: Casemate, 2015, 304 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/hollow-heroes/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A self-described amateur historian and former insurance company executive contributes nothing new, with many inaccuracies, in a potty, polemical approach. Jonathan Swift’s criticism of a 1720 book is apposite: “If this book were stripped of its impertinence, conceitedness, and tedious digressions it would be almost worth reading and would then be two-thirds smaller than it is.” —Erica L. Chenoweth<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Arnn, Larry P. <em>Churchill’s Trial: Winston Churchill and the Survival of Free Government</em>. Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2015, 240 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchills-trial-winston-churchill-and-the-salvation-of-free-government-by-dr-larry-p-arnn/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill studies can reveal important lessons that remain powerfully relevant for the leaders and citizens of free societies. This notion is itself founded on the belief that though the threats to civilization may have altered since Churchill’s day, there is consistency between his challenges and ours—that he is a good guide to follow in the cause of defending freedom. Such a belief must lie behind any conception of history as providing guidance. If these commonalities do not exist, neither Churchill’s story, nor history in general, has anything to say to us now. A unique and important work on Churchill’s political thought. —Justin D. Lyons</p>
<p><strong>Arthur, Max. <em>Churchill: The Life: An Authorised Pictorial Biography</em>. London: Cassell; Richmond Hill, Ont.: 2015, 272 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-life-max-arthur/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: There must be a hundred Churchill picture books, since he lived his entire life in the era of the camera. Max Arthur compiles several hundred, a few in color. The large format gives great impact to many we’ve seen before, but the print quality and the lighting is enhanced, making for a singular presentation. —Christopher Harmon</p>
<p><strong>Bungay, Stephen. <em>The Most Dangerous Enemy: A History of the Battle of Britain. </em>London: Arum Press, 2015, 512 pp.</strong> ✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/bungay-dangerous-enemy/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A well-organized, comprehensive, strategic and tactical account of the Battle of Britain from both sides. Questionable aspects are whether Britons ever countenanced an armistice, a questionable source about Churchill’s military competence, and the use of a discredited source for characterizing Luftwaffe Churchillief Hermann Göring.<em> </em> —McM</p>
<p><strong>Carlson, Alison. <em>The Man Within: Winston Churchill—An Intimate Portrait</em>. San Francisco: Inkshares, 2015, 224 pp. Sold with e-book included. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/the-man-within-an-intimate-portrait-by-alison-carlson/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: This photo-documentary has barely a third of the images in more elaborate works, but the photographer-author provides many interesting new ones. Examples: the newlywed Clementine and Winston going to their wedding reception; a lovely shot of their three daughters, Diana, Sarah and Mary, in 1925; several recently discovered group photos of young Winston at Harrow, rescued from a Cotswold barn. Worth seeking out. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Churchill, Anthony. <em>Winston’s Island: Winston Churchill, His Ancestors…Descendants and Formative Influences on the Isle of Wight.</em> Chale, I.o.W.: Cross Publishing, 2015, 112 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/winstons-island/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The Isle has a unique claim to its place in the saga: WSC’s parents met there; he holidays there as a boy; it was his first Queen’s favorite abode; he visited many times in later life. A pricey, landscape-format highly specialized work, beautifully executed. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Cliffe, Steve. <em>Churchill, Kitchener and Lloyd George: First World Warlords. </em>Oxford and Charleston: Fonthill Media, 2015, 144 pp. Reprints, softbound, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-kitchener-lloyd-george-steve-cliffe/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A small volume that surveys the lives and careers of three World War I leaders. There’s not much that is new, nor are there footnotes (at least in the Kindle edition) and index. Coverage is necessarily selective. Still, we are well reminded of the challenges of political-military command at the highest level, and the difficulties that it presents for even like-minded colleagues to pull together in harness. —Patrick J. Garrit<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Curran, Tom. <em>The Grand Deception: Winston Churchill and the Dardanelles.</em> Newport, N.S.W.: 2015, 416 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/curran-deception/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The premise of the work is hardly original: Churchill was solely responsible for both the ill-fated Dardanelles and Gallipoli campaigns. According to Curran, historians writing since the late 1960s have not recognized the full extent of Churchill’s culpability. Unbalanced, it is little more than a case for the prosecution. —Christopher M. Bell<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dementi, Brian A<em>. Churchill and Eisenhower: Together Again: A Virginia Visit</em>. Dementi Milestone Publications, 2015, 200 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-and-eisenhower/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: An elegant, landscape-format photo documentary of the Eisenhower-Churchill Virginia visit in March 1946, after Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech in Fulton, Missouri. Also includes the 1943 Williamsburg visit of Clementine and Mary Churchill. Photos are by Williamsburg photographer Frank Dementi. —Max Edward Hertwig</p>
<p><strong>Dockter, Warren. <em>Churchill and the Islamic World: Orientalism, Empire and Diplomacy in the Middle East</em>. London: I.B. Tauris, 2015, 378 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-and-the-islamic-world-by-warren-dockter/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Beginning in 1896, with a letter from Churchill to his old Head Master, Dockter reaches farther back than most accounts of the subject. He shows how Churchill’s Islamic experiences made him different from his contemporaries. Social science jargon appears, especially in early chapters. The book doesn’t shrink from Churchill’s more controversial remarks, but helps dispel modern out-of-context representations. —Erica L. Chenoweth</p>
<p><strong>Dockter, Warren, ed. <em>Winston Churchill at the Telegraph</em>. London: Aurum, 2015, 288 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/winston-churchill-at-the-telegraph-by-warren-dockter/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A collection of articles by and about Churchill from the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> (London). The long relationship began in 1897 when the young army officer wrote his first article (or letter) from the field, along the Afghan/Indian frontier. It culminated with the <em>Telegraph</em>’s extensive coverage of Churchill’s funeral in 1965. Excellent research though it lacks illustrations, an index, endnotes and a bibliography. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Ferney, Frédéric. <em>Tu seras un raté, mon fils! Churchill et son père</em> [<em>You Will Be a Failure, My Son! Churchill and His Father]. </em>Paris: Albin Michel. Collection La face cachée de l’Histoire, 2015. Text in French. </strong>✸ A strange book, possibly intended mainly for Freudians, who will learn little from it. Lord Randolph appears as the villain (the book heavily concentrates on Winston’s early life), with no redeeming characteristics. His son is conventionally praised, amidst many factual errors. —AC<strong> </strong></p>

Unlike almost every other book on the mythical correspondence between Churchill and Mussolini, it reveals the story of a blatant hoax. —Patrizio R. Giangreco and Andrew M. McGarvey</p>
<p><strong>Gorodetsky, Gabriel, ed. <em>The Maisky Diaries: Red Ambassador to the Court of St. James’s.</em> New Haven: Yale University Press, 2015, 634 pages. Also e-book, audiobook. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/the-maisky-diaries/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A striking work of scholarship (abridging of a three-volume complete work) this book offers fresh scholarship on Churchill Soviet relations. Ivan Maisky was a penetrating observer of 1932-43 Britain, and Gorodetsky connects every long gap in his diaries with informed accounts of what was happening. Very many references to Churchill throughout. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Hodgkinson, Brian. <em>Saviour of the Nation: An Epic Poem of Winston Churchill’s Finest Hour</em>. London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 2015. ✸ T</strong>wenty-four epic chapters of neo-Homeric verse extoll Churchill’s &#8220;Finest Hour&#8221; heroics. WSC is a modern Beowulf bravely battling the Grendel (i.e., the Nazi) Gang: “The savior of his country; one who’d plucked The flower of safety from the sting of death.” —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Kelly, John. <em>Never Surrender: Winston Churchill and Britain’s Decision to Fight Nazi Germany in the Fateful Summer of 1940</em>. London: Simon and Schuster; New York: Scribner, 2015, 370 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/never-surrender/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A well-organized review of well-known events, retold with dramatic prose and crisp analysis. Ideal for young people unfamiliar with the scope of Churchill’s achievement in 1940. This book will be compared with John Lukacs’ <em>Five Days in London: May 1940</em> (1999), but it is broader, and digs deeper. Kelly tracks the story from 1919 through the appeasement years, the drift to war, the colossal defeats of 1940. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Klepak, Hal. <em>Churchill Comes of Age: Cuba 1895. </em>Cheltenham, Glos.: History Press, 2015, 288 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/cuba-1895/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Klepak offers a singular original account through his comprehensive research of archival and published literature in Spain and Cuba, revealing a far more complex account of young Winston’s Cuban interlude than any before published. He punctures many myths, but relies a bit too much on Manchester’s <em>Last Lion</em> (1983). —WJS</p>

<p>L<strong>andemare, Georgina. <em>Churchill&#8217;s Cookbook. </em>London: Imperial War Museum, 2015, 160 pp.</strong> ✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchills-cookbook-by-georgina-landemare/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Partial reissue of Churchill&#8217;s cook&#8217;s 1958 book, <em>Recipes from No. 10, with</em> about 250 of her original recipes. It enhances our knowledge of the culinary side of Churchill’s later years. Unfortunately, the original, whimsical drawings by Selma Nankivell are replaced by new ones that are underwhelming.  —RML</p>
<p><strong>Langworth, Richard M. <em>Churchill and the Avoidable War: Could World War II Have Been Prevented?</em> Moultonborough, N.H.: Dragonwyck, 2015, 222 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-and-the-avoidable-war/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill always maintained that war could have been avoided through firm collective action. Here is a focused examination of that claim at each critical juncture: German rearmament, the Rhineland and Austria, the Czech and Polish crises, the roles of Stalin and Roosevelt. Langworth asks us not to be “innocent readers” of Churchill’s version of the tale, recognizing it is “always subject to re-examination. WSC was not always right. Could the war have been avoided? Yes, but with great difficulty.” —Justin Lyons</p>
<p><strong>Lepine, Mike. <em>Churchill and the Generals, 1939-1945</em>. Solihull: Danann Publishing, 2015, 138 pp. with two DVDs. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-and-the-generals/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: An illustrated chronology of the Second World War with an excellent brief biography of Churchill, using images covering his life. The special value of this book is its compiling of individual stories of various generals and their encounters with the prime minister. —Fred Glueckstein</p>
<p><strong>Lough, David. <em>No More Champagne: Churchill and His Money</em>. London: Picador, 2015, 534 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/no-more-champagne/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Ploughing fresh ground, Lough offers a well-written, deeply researched text about Churchill’s finances, and how they affected his politics. As private as some may regard personal finances, the book does not detract from Churchill’s greatness or humanity. It is an absorbing story about an extraordinary man ensuring his financial survival with one hand, while warning about the danger to, and then leading the fight for, Western Civilization with the other. Uniquely, Churchill did both. —Michael McMenamin<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Morrisey, Will. <em>Churchill and de Gaulle: The Geopolitics of Liberty. </em>Lanham, Md.: Rowman and Littlefield, 2015, 446 pp. </strong>✸ Inevitably compared to Kersaudy’s much earlier work by the same title, this book is unique in its superbly informed interpretation of how the two leaders strove to preserve their ideals of freedom. This is a fresh way of approaching the subject which makes the book most valuable for anyone interested in international relations as well as two impressive lives. —AC<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Purnell, Sonia. <em>Clementine: The Life of Mrs. Winston Churchill. </em>New York: Viking; London: Aurum, 2015, 448 pp. Reprints, e-book. Translations: Lithuanian. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/life-of-mrs-winston-churchill/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Writing off the leading Clementine biography as the “family’s viewpoint,” the author claims this is new and revealing. Aside from unproven innuendo, established facts labeled as revelations and the elevation of trivia over substance, little is new, save for a very good account of Lady Churchill’s work in the Second World War, and dives into rumors about loves and lovers. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Radice, Giles. <em>Odd Couples: The Great Political Pairings of Modern Britain</em>. London: I.B. Tauris, 2015, 292 pp.. </strong>✸ Included here for Chapter 1, contrasting the audacious Churchill with the efficient Attlee—initiator and facilitator respectively, in the great Second World War winning cabinet, and mutually respectful in postwar opposition. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Read, Simon. <em>Winston Churchill Reporting: Adventures of a Young War Correspondent.</em> Boston: Da Capo Press, 2015, 328 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/winston-churchill-reporting/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill’s early career was a “true tale of adventure…Churchill as Indiana Jones.” Read says his experiences divested him of his father’s shadow, informed his complex views on warfare, and equipped him for the rough and tumble of parliamentary life. It was the crucible of his remarkable moral vision and courage in the 20th century. —WJS</p>

London: Tyndale House, 2015, 268 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/god-and-churchill/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The book is clearly inspired by the heartfelt faith of the two authors and the sincerity of their desire to explore the life of a 20th century hero as viewed through the lens of God’s work and His word as revealed in the Bible. Churchill cherished the universal values taught by Christianity and the Bible, but there is room for more discussion on his deeply-held personal beliefs. —Erica L. Chenoweth</p>
<p><strong>Schneer, Jonathan. <em>Ministers at War: Winston Churchill and His War Cabinet</em>.

Cripps, Bevin, Beaverbrook, Morrison and possibly Eden all probably harbored hopes of succeeding Churchill if he tripped up. It is ironic therefore that the person who eventually did so was the scrupulously loyal Clement Attlee. The American scholar understands the arcane practices of 1940s British politics, which stands him in good stead in this intelligent and fluently-written book. —Andrew Roberts<strong> </strong></p>

Despite its large format and high-quality binding, this is no coffee table book. In fact, Vogt provides detailed information about Churchill’s lifetime attachment to this small but strategically and economically important country. —Klaus Larres</p>

When he appears here, it is as a bit player, because that fits Wapshott’s interpretation that FDR was the genius who led Americans into war. Really? The U.S. got there, two years and four months after it started. Churchill was never FDR’s Sancho Panza. —Warren F. Kimball</p>

This grossly overpriced item is an under-the-coffee table book: no bulk, little content, likely to dive quickly to the bottom shelf. —WJS</p>

Oxford: University Press, 2016, 208 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-ireland-steve-bew/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill’s multi-layered relationship with Ireland receives detailed and forensic treatment. Bew is readable, reliable, and brings new perspectives. He reminds us that Churchill was intimately involved in the Curragh Mutiny, and the incredibly sensitive Irish negotiations up to the outbreak of the First World War—and that this formed his “training” in handling nationalist extremism and domestic political violence. —Robert Courts</p>

London: Institute of Historical Research, 2016, 86 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-cannadine/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Although Churchill was losing support in the 1920s and early 1930s, Bristol stood by him. Through 1954, he frequently visited to speak on current events, and learned much there about addressing academic audiences and accepting many later honorary degrees. This is a brief, excellent survey of a little-known corner of his life.</p>

Per capita, Canada was the largest contributor of fighting personnel, materiel and capital in the Second World War. No nation was more generous, and the feisty Canadian Navy was one of the largest and most effective afloat.

<p><strong>De Wailly, Henry.<em> Invasion Syria 1941: Churchill and De Gaulle’s Forgotten War.</em> London and New York: I.B. Taurus, 2016, 416 pages.</strong> ✸ A campaign history primarily from the perspective of French internecine conflict. Focused on the gritty reality of combat, Churchill is nevertheless a commanding if distant presence. Quoting liberally from Churchill’s memoirs, he is portrayed as a “likable Bulldog” who abandoned prudence for an adventurous thrust that was soon overshadowed by Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union. —WJS</p>

An unbalanced appraisal: The partnership succeeded one leader running roughshod over the other; but through prolonged arguments among serious leaders, men of great political character, if not identical visions. —Patrick J.

Hermiston chronicles not only how they worked in harness, despite manifestly different backgrounds, but how Churchill—whom many say had no concern for others—orchestrated their performance. —RML<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Kelly, John. <em>Saving Stalin: Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and the Cost of Allied Victory in Europe. </em>New York: Hachette, 2020, 384 pp.</strong> ✸ Mixed reviews generally suggest it has little to do with the title, flirting lightly with Lend-Lease and the convoys to Russia but not coming to grips with the difficult choice faced by the Anglo-Americans in chooseing to right with their Soviet ally.</p>
<p><strong>Kersaudy, François. <em>Churchill: Stratège passionné</em> <em>[Passionate Strategist]. </em>Paris: Perrin/Tallandier, 2016. Collection Maîtres de guerre. Text in French. </strong>✸ The eminent French historian asks: what remained of Churchill’s “passionate” struggle to preserve peace and freedom after the disappointments following victory in 1945? It is a good question, and this book is a tour-de-force, through its mastery in adducing and manipulating massive sources into a readable, convincing narrative. Abetted by large color maps, unfamiliar cartoons, a selection of postage stamps and many useful photos. In short, it is a delight. —AC</p>

The surgical precision with which Churchill is cut down to size will radically change not only your view of the man, but also of the fake world in which we live.” Need we say more? —Michael Richards</p>

Translations: Dutch. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-europe-felix-klos/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: There is a fascinating book to be written about Churchill’s relationship with the concept of a United Europe. Unfortunately, for all its hype, Felix Klos has written only the first part of it (WSC’s urgings for united Europe immediately after the war), and not, in fact, the most important part (his firm opposition to Britain joining a federal Europe after he returned to power in 1951). —Andrew Roberts<strong> </strong></p>

Not taken too literally, it is a good description of the life he found there. —AC</p>

It established his national fame, connected his fate to that of the British Empire, introduced him to key figures who were to loom large later in his life, and set him on the road to his phenomenally successful political career. —Andrew Roberts<strong> </strong></p>

London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2016, 424 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-bomb-kevin-ruane/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: There are many valuable accounts of Churchill’s nuclear thinking during his second premiership, notably by Klaus Larres and Peter Hennessey. But, for me, the account Ruane gives here is outstanding for the breadth of its scholarship, the richness of its narrative and the acuity of its judgements. —Graham Farmelo<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ségéric, Jean-José. <em>Churchill et la guerre navale</em> <em>[and the Naval War].</em> Paris: L’Harmattan, 2016, 436 pp. </strong>✸ The retired naval author is more at ease with a ship than a pen. His grammar and spelling would shame a schoolchild, and he is completely lost in the complexity of British political history, describing, for example, Aneurin Bevan as an American and speaking of “Air-Marshal Tedder of the USAF.” This is a missed opportunity to make this aspect of Churchill better known to the French public. —AC</p>

Marshall had his critics but as principal military advisor to Roosevelt, he was acclaimed as the “organizer of victory.” In his Nobel Lecture, he acknowledged his “inability to express myself with the power and penetration of the great Churchill.” —Patrick J.

Like all syntheses, Todman’s has weaknesses, but in general his book has many countervailing strengths: clarity in exposition and a fine touch when dealing with the oft-scanted civilian and production side of the story. —Raymond A. Callaha</p>
<p><strong>__________. <em>Britain’s War, </em>Vol. 2, A<em> New World 1942-1947, </em>. Oxford University Press, 2020, 994 pages. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/todman-1942-1947/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Massive but clearly written, thoroughly grounded in the enormous literature on the subject. The huge war effort produced victory, along with bankruptcy and the beginnings of an imperial unraveling. The process is hard to grasp in its entirety and even Todman’s nearly 2000 pages (in two volumes) barely manages to do so. The Todman volumes ably summarize what we now know. As an assessment of the last astounding act in Britain’s imperial era, it cannot be recommended too strongly. —Raymond A. Callahan<strong> </strong></p>

London: Bloomsbury, 2016, 224 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/alan-watson-churchill-fulton-zurich/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A slim volume containing two jewels: Churchill’s 1946 speeches at Fulton and Zürich. It provides much interesting background information on the two milestones. Lord Watson, a Liberal Democrat with wide experience in media, academic and foreign relations, focuses on the critical speeches and their long-term effects. —PHC</p>

It is welcome testimony to how Churchill’s career was temporarily ruined by events beyond his control. All the same, Bell reminds us that at the time, Churchill’s critics, growing in number, regarded him as a danger to British futures. —Barry Gough</p>
<p><strong>Bew, John. <em>Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain. </em>New York: Oxford University Press, 2017, 570 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/clement-attlee-bew-cohen/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: An excellent critical study of the Labour prime minister that stands to be a standard work. As Bew notes, “we continue to live in a world of Attlee’s creation.” He provides an understanding of Attlee’s personality and belief system, and accurately portrays his personal modesty. Particularly good in describing the Churchill-Attlee relationship. —Bradley P. Tolppanen</p>
<p><strong>Black, Jonathan. <em>Winston Churchill in British Art, 1900 to the Present Day: The Titan with Many Faces. </em>London: Bloomsbury, 2017, 302 pp.</strong> ✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/winston-churchill-british-art-black/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A book on how Churchill has been presented is a good idea, but this one lacks cohesion and unity. Transitions between the paintings, sculptures and political cartoons are abrupt and unorganized, and images often interrupt the text in mid-sentence. In spite of these aesthetic and organizational flaws, however, Black’s book offers an interesting perspective into Churchill’s multi-faceted personality. —Katie Davenport</p>
<p><strong>Catherwood, Christopher. <em>Churchill and Tito: SOE, Bletchley Park and Supporting the Yugoslav Communists in World War II</em>. Barnsley, Yorks.: Pen and Sword, 2017. ✸ </strong>Despite a swipe at right-wing Churchill worship, the author ironically defends Churchill’s 1943 decision, criticized recently by Peter Batty (see 2011 reviw), to switch support from Serbian Cetniks to the Tito’s Communists resisting the Axis in Yugoslavia. Catherwood incorrectly claims this was only based upon onsite reports by Fitzroy MacLean. —WJS</p>

Kimball. <em>Contributors</em>: David G. Haglund, Alan P. Dobson, Robert M. Hendershot, Srjdan Vucetec, Steve Marsh, Anna Marchi, Nuria Lorenzo-Dus, Sam Edwards, David Ryan. The most contentious is a one-sided view of Churchill on racial issues by Vucetec; our review provides links to more detailed discussions of that subject. —Bradley P. Tolppanen</p>
<p><strong>Gough, Barry. <em>Churchill and Fisher: Titans at the Admiralty. </em>Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2017, 640 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-fisher-titans-admiralty-goug/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A landmark book that updates our understanding of Churchill at the Admiralty (1911-15) and his relations with his top naval commander. Gough deeply considers how Fisher, once a devoted ally, deserted Churchill over the Dardanelles, costing him his office; only to see Churchill, a year or so later, urging that Fisher be rehired as First Sea Lord. —Christopher H. Sterling<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Harte, John. <em>Churchill: The Young Warrior—How He Helped to Win the First World War.</em> New York: Skyhorse, 2017, 365 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-john-harte/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Part of a proposed five-volume biography: a readable enough summary hitting most of the high spots, based only on secondary sources. <em>Young Warrior</em> seems to have begun as an “early life,” before the other volumes were considered. —Christopher H. Sterling</p>
<p><strong>Harte, John. <em>How Churchill Saved Civilization: The Epic Story of 13 Years That Almost Destroyed the World. </em>New York: Skyhorse, 2017, 386 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-john-harte/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Follows onto the above, covering the years 1933-45. Harte claims it will “resolve the lingering mysteries” about the Second World War, quite an assignment for a shortish book that shuns primary sources with maps too small to read. The result is something of a “condensed book,” offering little insight into these mysteries. —Christopher H. Sterling</p>
<p><strong>Hossack, Leslie. <em>Charting Churchill: An Architectural Biography of Sir Winston Churchill. </em>London: Blurb, 2017, 162 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/hossack-charting-churchill/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A lavish, very expensive collection of sixty professional photographs of sites and buildings in or around London linked to Churchill’s personal and political life, accompanied by an original descriptive essay, provides new insights into Churchill’s complex character and times. Beautifully executed, though it lacks consideration of the buildings’ importance in Churchill’s story. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Klos, Felix. <em>Churchill’s Last Stand: The Struggle to Unite Europe</em>. London: I.B. Tauris, 2017, 288 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchills-last-stand-united-europe-klos/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: In trying to persuade us that Churchill favored Britain joining a federal Europe, the conscientious author comes up against immovable obstacles. The most serious is that in his 1951-55 premiership, Churchill personally, regularly and decisively blocked Britain joining any of the European federal institutions that then existed. —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Korda, Michael. <em>Alone: Britain, Churchil and Dunkirk, Defeat into Victory. </em>New York: Liveright, 2017, 540 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/alone-britain-churchill-dunkirk-korda/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill’s relationship with the famous filmmaker Alexander Korda brought his son Michael into close proximity during the “sterner days” of 1940 and the threat of Britain’s defeat and invasion. The author persuasively connects the heroism of Dunkirk with British attitudes of the present toward the continent and the European Union. A rewarding and good read because the author weaves personal experiences into the drama of May-June 1940. —AC</p>
<p><strong>Kryske, Lawrence M. <em>Churchill without Blood, Sweat, or Tears</em>. Self-published, 2017. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/kryske-churchill-leadership/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A tour de force on Churchill leadership techniques, explored inside and out and accessible for ready application. Churchill’s inspiration is evident throughout his book, as is his humor. Kryske provides a road map to leadership success with practical strategies he describes as “applied Churchill.&#8221; —WJS</p>
<p><strong>L’Aulnoit, Beatrix de. <em>Moi. Winston Churchill. </em>Paris: Éditions Tallandier, 2017, 192 pp. Text in French. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/de-laulnoit-moi-pictorial-documentary/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Of limited scholarly value, this photo documentary says nothing new and contains a number of mistakes. Its strength, however, is in its unusual photos of Churchill’s family, friends and colleagues, many in large format. There is also a well-chosen collection of cartoons, from Low’s famous “All Behind You, Winston” (1940) to Vicky’s little-known “Voice in the Wilderness” (1934). Worthwhile for the images, not the text. —AC</p>
<p><strong>Langworth, Richard M. <em>Winston Churchill, Myth and Reality: What He Actually Did and Said</em>. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland and Company, 2017, 250 pp. Reprints, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/winston-churchill-myth-reality/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: If you have never read a Churchill biography, do not start with this book. But, once you have read such an account, you will find this volume illuminating. Methodically it corrects long-running canards about Churchill’s ancestors, parents and early career; his depiction as a warmonger, a sinker of passenger ships, alcoholism, Zionism, Bolshevism. Eleven chapters explode the myths of the Second World War, from the famous (like bombing Dresden or not bombing Auschwitz) to the obscure (Monte Cassino). The Churchill who emerges is human, all too human. His failures are those of a man with a lot on his plate. —Paul A. Rahe<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lavery, Brian. <em>Churchill Warrior: How a Military Life Guided Winston’s Finest Hours.</em> Oxford: Casemate, 2017, 448 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-warrior/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A naval historian diverts to Churchill’s military service and how it shaped and prepared him for leadership in 1940. Lavery shows how Churchill ultimately listened to his military chiefs, despite challenging their conclusions frequently. More tightly organized than D’Este’s <em>Warlord</em> (2008), less insightful than Russell’s <em>Winston Churchill Soldier</em> or Best’s <em>Churchill and War</em> (both 2005). —Christopher H.

<p><strong>Lehrman, Lewis E. <em>Churchill, Roosevelt and Company: Studies in Character and Statecraft. </em>Mechanicsburg, Penna.: Stackpole Books, 2017, 472 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-roosevelt-company-studies-character-statecraft/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Lehrman examines the two through the teams they assembled: advisers, political officials and military leaders. Not a history of the war, but an evaluation of people, decisions and events, a victory followed by a lost peace. A useful chronology and extensive notes are complemented by portrait photographs and two key appendices: a 1940 Roosevelt fireside chat, and Churchill’s victory speech in 1945. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>McCarten, Anthony. <em>Darkest Hour: How Churchill Brought Us Back from the Brink</em>. London: Viking; New York: Harper, 2017, 336 pp. Also </strong><strong>softbound</strong><strong>, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/darkest-hourengland-brink-mccarten/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Published to coincide with the film by that title starring Gary Oldman as WSC. After starting out with an potted and somewhat fanciful biography, we have the dubious theory, put forward dramatically as a historic discovery, that Churchill seriously considered peace with Hitler. Aside from insisting that everyone else is wrong about this, it’s an entertaining canter over familiar ground. —RML<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Morris, Max: <em>The Smart Words and Wicked Wit of Winston Churchill. </em>New York: Skyhorse, 2017, 160 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/morris-smart-words/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Fluffed up to 160 pages but few words per page. &#8220;Churchill’s words are now so thoroughly documented that there is no need to misquote him. Morris could have applied himself to achieving accuracy—and thought of a phrase besides “Wicked Wit,” used by a previous, even less accurate quote book.&#8221; —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Owen, David: <em>Cabinet’s Finest Hour: The Hidden Agenda of May 1940. </em>London: Haus, 2017, 320 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/cabinets-finest-hour-david-owen/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Owen reproduces minutes of all nine War Cabinet meetings, using his own political experience to analyze what was happening. He argues that Churchill never intended to approach Hitler for an armistice, and was not waiting on events, but cleverly shaping them. “A prime minister,” he writes, “controls the agenda.” —McM</p>
<p><strong>Ricks, Thomas E. <em>Churchill and Orwell: The Fight for Freedom</em>. New York: Penguin, 2017, 350 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-orwell-liberty/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The two never met or even corresponded. Ricks accepts that they were “vastly dissimilar men, with very different life trajectories.” Churchill, 28 years older, was much more robust, extroverted and oratorically fluent. Orwell had a “phlegmatic and introverted personality.” Orwell named the hero of <em>1984</em> “Winston,” and Churchill read it twice. But is that really enough of a connection to justify an entire book? —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Shakespeare, Nicholas. <em>Six Minutes in May: How Churchill Unexpectedly Became Prime Minister.</em> London: Harvill Secker, 2017, 458 pp. Reprints. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/six-minutes-may-nicholas-shakespeare/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A fascinating account of WSC’s dramatic rise to succeed Chamberlain, covering two key questions: Why did Halifax refuse the job? And what really happened on 9 May 1940, when he, Chamberlain and Churchill agreed on Winston? The author contends that, absent the fiasco in Norway, when Churchill’s Admiralty failed to stop Hitler’s occupation, the crisis might never have arisen. A thoughtful book revealing many little-known aspects of the change in command at Downing Street. —McM</p>
<p><strong>Smith, Nancy. <em>Churchill on the Riviera: Winston Churchill, Wendy Reves and the Villa La Pausa Built by Coco Chanel. </em>Columbus, Ohio: Biblio, 2017, 380 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-french-riviera-connections/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A good and mainly accurate account of Churchill’s postwar visits to the Reves and La Pausa, covering the ageing Churchill’s habits, tastes, wishes and mental framework—in short his personality in the last decade of his life. Also speculates on the estrangement from his hosts, a sad chapter in the story. —AC</p>
<p><strong>Scott, Brough. <em>Churchill at the Gallop. </em>Newbury, Berks.: Racing Post Books, 2017, 230 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-gallop-brough-scott/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A horse racing journalist, Scott considers Churchill’s equine experience from a unique angle. Take the charge at Omdurman, Churchill exchanging sword for pistol without taking his left hand off the reins. “It’s actually pretty difficult to do,” let alone as the horse crashed into the seething throng of the enemy. Such feats encouraged Scott to dig deeper, producing a unique aspect completely untouched by other works. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Smithback, John Bell. <em>Asia Betrayed: How Churchill Sacrificed the Far East to Save England</em>. Hong Kong: Earnshaw Books, 2017, 268 pp. ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/smithback-asia-betrayed/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>. An English writer long resident in Asia highlights Japan’s crimes against Asians by charging that Churchill covertly tricked Japan into the Second World War to secure United States entry. No credible proof is produced whatsoever in a well written but poorly sourced and sloppily edited book. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Toye, Richard, ed. <em>Winston Churchill: Politics, Strategy and Statecraft</em>. London: Bloomsbury, 2017. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/statecraft-editor-richard-toye/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Claiming to analyze “key themes in Churchill’s life” (which many like books do better), it offers little that is new and lacks editorial unity. Some authors deliver solid accounts, others cover the same ground less effectively, and agree or disagree, with no cross-references or attempts to contrast their opinions. <em>Contributors</em>: Paul Addison: “Churchill and Women.” Stuart Ball: “Churchill and the Conservative Party.” Jeremy Black: “Churchill as Strategist in World War Two.” Peter Catterall: “Churchill as Chancellor of the Exchequer”; “Churchill and the General Strike.” Warren Dockter: “Churchill and the Islamic World.” Richard Overy: “Churchill and Airpower.” Kevin Ruane: “Churchill and Nuclear Weapons”; “Churchill and the Cold War.” David Thackeray: “The Young Statesman.” Richard Toye: “Churchill and the Empire.” David Woolner: “Churchill and the Birth of the Anglo-American ‘Special Relationship.’” Christopher Wrigley: “Churchill and Labour.” —Michael Richards<strong> </strong></p>

Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/tharoor-inglorious-empire/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Indian nationalists believed that British had to leave for India to thrive. But they did not think that the British were the root of India’s problem. A one-sided, hypercritical half-truth, like half a brick, is always more forcible as an argument than a whole one. It carries better. —Tirthankar Roy</p>
<p><strong>Wiles, Richard. <em>Biographic </em><em>Churchill</em>. Lewes, Sussex: Ammonite Press, 2017, 96 pp. “Great Lives in Graphic Form” series. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-great-lives-graphic-form-wiles/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A serious book in what used to be the preserve of juvenile albums. Line art, silhouettes, maps, tables and timelines replace photos. The author is no Churchill historian and makes various errors. Unconventionally attractive, with intriguing tidbits: where else will we find (in “Clothes Maketh the Man”) a sketch of WSC’s pink silk drawers? —AC</p>
<p><strong>Wright, Damien. <i>Churchill’s Secret War with Lenin: British and Commonwealth Military Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1918-1920, </i>576 pp. Gilwice, Poland: Helion, 2017. </strong>✸ A massive glossy tome sympathetically documenting Britain&#8217;s campaign against the Bolsheviks. The title, however, is misleading. Both Churchill and Lenin are almost completely nonexistent throughout the text.  —WJS</p>

<p><strong>Albuquerque, Miguel. <em>Winston Churchill na [in] Madeira.</em> Lisbon: Alétheia, 2018, 144 pp., softbound.

The text is sprightly and readable, “unputdownable.” Anyone interested in the personal side of the great man should have this book. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Cannadine, David. <em>Churchill: The Statesman as Artist</em>. London: Bloomsbury, 2018, 186 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/cannadine/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Part One comprises twelve Churchill essays and speeches on art, of which only “Painting as a Pastime” is well known. Part Two includes appreciations of Churchill’s work by eminent authorities such as Eric Newton, Thomas Bodkin, and the Tate Gallery’s Sir John Rothenstein. An interesting adjunct to the more elaborate books on Churchill’s art. —AC</p>

A magnum opus and a major landmark in Churchill studies: the first comprehensive and critical guide to every aspect of his life and times. This is a prodigious feat of intellect and hard work. It emancipates readers by handing them the keys to scores of Churchillian themes and topics. It is written with meticulous attention to detail, and a mastery of the subject reflected in a sparkling stream of insights and reflections. It is deeply serious for long stretches but great fun at intervals. <em>C’est magnifique</em>. —Paul Addison<strong> </strong></p>

London: Biteback, 2018. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/clement-attlee-bew-cohen/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: “Interspersing the careers of the two prime ministers, Cohen eschews references, commits many errors and typos, and does not refer to the Churchhttps://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/clement-attlee-bew-cohen/ill Documents.

<p><strong>Cusic, Don. <em>Winston Churchill’s Love of Music: Churchill Didn’t Have a Tin Ear</em>. Nashville: Brackish Publishing, 2018, 122 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-music-don-cusic/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The text traces Churchill’s life and career, tracking every reference the author found to music and song. We range from the marches, ditties and Gilbert and Sullivan Churchill loved to the powerfully inspirational. Which lyrics are presented is purely arbitrary, but once chosen, we get every word. Churchill’s youthful encounters with the ’cello and piano are duly noted. —RML<strong> </strong></p>

Part of a series of comic strip works on famous figures. The quality of the art does not match Frank Bellamy’s in Clifford Makins’ superb <em>Happy Warrior</em> (1958), and is uneven: Alanbrooke is not bad, Montgomery execrable. Fortunately, the commentary is by a reputable Churchill historian. —AC<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heyking, John von. <em>Comprehensive Judgment and Absolute Selflessness: Winston Churchill on Politics as Friendship</em>. South Bend, Ind.: St. Augustine’s Press, 2018, 224 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/comprehensive-judgment-heyking/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Von Heyking considers how much friendship matters in politics and statesmanship, examining WSC’s greatest friendships, including F.E. Smith, Max Beaverbrook, and Franklin Roosevelt. Worth the reading, this is an interesting scholarly work placing Churchill’s practices of friendship within a philosophical grounding. —Bradley P.

<p><strong>Kryske, Lawrence M. <em>Churchill Without Blood, Sweat, or Tears: Applying His Methods for Today’s Leaders.</em> Plano, Texas: self-published, 2018, 158 pp., softbound. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/kryske-churchill-leadership/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A useful guide in “Applied Churchill,” applying Churchill’s methods to ourselves today. A tour de force on Churchill leadership techniques, explored inside and out and interpreted for modern application. Churchill’s inspiration is evident throughout his book, as is his humor. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Leebaert, Derek. <em>Grand Improvisation: America Confronts the British Superpower, 1945-1957. </em>New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2018, 614 pp.; also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/leebaert-grand-improvisation/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill told a general: “Improvise and dare…He improvose and dore.” Leebaert sees America’s walk to global leadership in much the same way. Attlee’s and Churchill’s postwar governments were not always America’s poodles; only after Suez (1956) does the US assume leading power status. Well-researched, highly readable. —WJS<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lehrman, Lewis E. <em>Lincoln and Churchill: Statesmen at War</em>. </strong><strong>Guilford, Conn.: Stackpole, 2018, 544 pp.; also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/lincoln-churchill-lewis-lehrman/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: An accomplished historian offers an intimate comparison of the two greatest democratic war leaders. The first comparative book-length history of the two commanders, each in wars of national survival, setting heroic standards of leadership through mastery of language. Sumptuously sourced and footnoted. —WJS<strong> </strong></p>

Sheds bright light on the youthful Churchill’s hopes and dreams, while revealing his mother’s worldly, solicitous, loving influence. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Napier, Stephen. <em>Churchill: Military Genius or Menace?</em> Stroud, Glos.: History Press, 2018, 448 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/napier-churchill-genius-menace/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Provocative title, but readers may be rather surprised that the preamble and first chapter praise Churchill’s warnings of the need to rearm in the face of Nazi Germany. Napier then adds several straightforward chapters covering the early days of the war and Churchill becoming prime minister. —Terry Reardon<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Packwood, Allen. <em>How Churchill Waged War: The Most Challenging Decisions of the Second World War.</em> Barnsley, Yorks.: Frontline, 2018, 288 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchill-waged-war-packwood/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The objective is to illustrate how Churchill approached wartime challenges, not to assess the results of his decisions. Therefore the book is best for those who already have an understanding of the wartime events. Readers with a more rudimentary knowledge might expect “the rest of the story.” —Terry Reardon</p>
<p><strong>Reynolds, David and Pechnatov, Vladimir, eds. <em>The Kremlin Letters: Stalin’s Wartime Correspondence with Churchill and Roosevelt. </em>New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2018, 680 pp. Reprints, softbound, e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/kremlin-letters/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The correspondence is now accompanied by a narrative providing historical context providing a record of what Stalin thought about what Churchill and Roosevelt told him. The book contains 75% of the exchanges; the rest, lengthy lists of supplies, birthday greetings, etc., will be available in a digital edition. The narrative is a major re-examination of the politics of the war. —Warren F. Kimball</p>

New sources, for one thing. But the real justification is that this book is excellent, the best Churchill biography since Sir Martin Gilbert’s <em>Churchill: A Life</em> (1991). It has the adventure, energy, and incessant movement that Churchill produced. It is witty, fluent, and precise, in rhythm with the material. It gallops across decades and through the largest episodes in history. It is devoid of the smug second guessing that we all may commit, especially when writing history. It is the product of a massive and faithful labor. It tells the story of a wonderful life with accuracy and dash, with richness and comprehension. It raises all the questions and provides the material for their contemplation. —Larry P. Arnn</p>
<p><strong>Rose, Jill.. <em>Nursing Churchill: A Wartime Life from the Private Letters of Winston Churchill’s Nurse</em>. Stroud, Glos.: Amberley Publishing, 2018, 286 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/nursing-churchill-jill-rose/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The author’s mother nursed Churchill in London after he returned from a near-death battle with pneumonia in February 1943. Beyond that, the book is well worth the read describing her parents, deeply in love, separated by war, with shrewd observations of life at the top. A delightful account of experiences of so many Britons in the Second World War. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Steyn, Richard. <em>Churchill’s Confidant: Jan Smuts, Enemy to Lifelong Friend. </em>London: Robinson Publishing, 2018, 352 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/steyn-confidant-reardon/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Among many close personal friendships that Churchill enjoyed in political and military life, one of the more unlikely was with a former foe, the South African statesman Jan Christian Smuts. Richard Steyn has offered a plethora of new information and insights in a readable account of this important friendship. —Terry Reardon</p>

<p><strong>Attenborough, Wilfred. <em>Diagnosing Churchill: Bipolar or “Prey to Nerves”? </em>Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2019. </strong>✸ The author’s second monograph on the subject (see 2014) aims at “a more rounded, more securely founded, understanding of Churchill’s psychological functioning— an understanding that, although not complete, will be substantial.”</p>

Extending through Munich, Poland and the onslaught on the West, it concludes with Lord Halifax’s unsuccessful efforts, in May 1940 to determine Hitler’s terms for peace. —McM</p>
<p><strong>Clews, Graham T. <em>Churchill’s Phoney War: A Study in Folly and Frustration</em>. Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2019, 360 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/clews-phoney-war/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill hoped the effective use of naval power would defeat Germany in the short term and deter Italy and Japan further on. But he was constrained—not only by Pound but by the political-military straitjacket of the Anglo-French alliance. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Cohen, David. <em>Churchill and Attlee: The Unlikely Allies Who Won the War. </em>London: Biteback, 2019, 362 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/clement-attlee-bew-cohen/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A narrative interspersing the two careers. Cohen eschews references, and does not list the Churchill Papers in his bibliography. Their wartime relationship receives only eighty-one pages. Typos and errors slip in. Readers interested in the Churchill-Attlee relationship are better off with Bew (2017) and McKinstry (2019). —Bradley P. Tolppanen</p>
<p><strong>Crowcroft, Robert. <em>The End Is Nigh: British Politics, Power and the Road to the Second World War. </em>Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2019, 304 pp. Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/crowcroft-end-nigh-addison/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: In seeking to demolish Chamberlain and Churchill for losing both Empire and peace, Crowcroft argues that both were self-serving and lacked vision. He is cynical about democracy, which, he maintains, has always been a system steeped in humbug and manipulated by politicians selling bogus promises and wishful thinking. Perhaps he should consider Churchill’s appraisal of democracy versus “all the other systems.” —Paul Addison</p>

New York: HarperCollins, 2019, $28.99, Amazon $20.49, Kindle $13.99. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/pilecki-fairweather/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The story of a valiant Pole who caused himself to be arrested and sent to Auschwitz to report on goings on is essentially a story of the Polish experience. It does give a stark vision of what Pilecki saw of the Holocaust, coupled with detailed but somewhat elliptical view of when Churchill knew, and what he might have done. —Richard Cohen and RML<strong> </strong></p>

But it must comport with the known facts, and be done with a rapier, not a cudgel. Why would Hamilton raise the inconsequential to the significant? With admirers like this, Churchill’s memory needs no enemies. —Warren F. Kimball<strong> </strong></p>

Also e-book. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/stafford-1921/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A masterful portrait of a key Churchill year. The picture is of a reflective and vulnerable man of character, strengthened by every reverse—a man of vision and, to a few observers, “a prime minister in the making.” Really good books about Churchill are scarce these days, and deserve full appreciation. This one belongs in the top 20 specialized studies. —WJS</p>

New York: Post Hill Press, 2020, 224 pp. Also e-book.</strong> <strong>✸ </strong>Superficial similarities accompany 48 pages of Trump speeches and seven pages of Churchill&#8217;s to support specious comparisons which are ahistorical, as with similar comparisons equating WSC with modern political figures. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Allport, Alan. <em>Britain at Bay: The Epic Story of the Second World War, 1938-1941</em>. New York: Knopf, 2020, 608 pp. Also e-book, audiobook. ✸</strong><strong> </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/allport-britain-atbay/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> Allport sees the reality of the Anglo-American wartime alliance, but the long shadow of Churchill’s memoirs still dominates the most studied war in history.  Perhaps it is still too soon to discount the “Churchill effect.” —Raymond A. Callahan</p>
<p><strong>Baruma, Ian. <em>The Churchill Complex: The Curse of Being Special, from Winston and FDR to Trump and Brexit</em>. London: Penguin, 2020, 320 pp. Also e-book, audiobook</strong>. <strong>✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/buruma-churchill-complex/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s like a quip-filled column by Maureen Dowd or Tucker Carlson. The quips are amusing, but backed by little evidence they remain somehow unsatisfying. Buruma notes how Anglo-American leaders routinely abducted Churchill to fit their own political purposes—just as Buruma does. The book iteself is testimony to the persistence of the AASR.&#8221; —Warren F. Kimball</p>
<p><strong>Carver, Nancy. <em>The Inspiring History of a Special Relationship</em>. Fulton, Mo.: National Churchill Museum, 2020, 338 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/carver-special-relationship/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> Carver explains how Churchill’s &#8220;Iron Curtain&#8221; speech came to be delivered at Westminster College; the Anglo-American special relationship which led up to it; and how College imagined and achieved a living memorial to Churchill and his pivotal address. —David Forman</p>
<p><strong>Catherwood, Christopher. <em>Winston Churchill: A Reference Guide to his Life and Works.</em> London &amp; New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2020, 216 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/catherwood-reference-guide/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> Allegedly aimed at young adults, though it is difficult to see what young adults will gain from it. Seat oiut alphabetically, with a brief index and biblioigraphy. A curiously unbalanced mixture. —Dave Turrell</p>
<p><strong>Charlwood, David. <em>Churchill and Eden: Partners through War and Peace</em>. Barnsley, Yorks.: Pen and Sword, 2020, 296 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/eden-churchill-charlwood/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> Not a dual biography, but a new perspective on Eden, with a focus on international relations, in particular with the United States and Russia. Charlwood reappraises Eden in context of his close and sometimes contentious relationship with Churchill as the latter’s “heir apparent.” The author credibly argues that Eden was undervalued as Churchill’s “mainstay.” —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Clark, Peter. <em>Churchill’s Britain: From the Antrim Coast to the Isle of Wight</em>. London: Haus, 2020, 240 pp. “Armchair Traveller” series. ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/clark-churchills-britain/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Billed as both a travelogue and a primer for the general reader, this book is neither. There are no photographs, an inadequate index, less than comprehensive coverage. Entries almost always involve what Churchill was doing at the time (with no new revelations) rather than stories of the place and its role in the story. Places, per se, usually get a paragraph or less—and no index entry. Nor are there guides to venues open to visitors. The comprehensive guide to Churchill’s Britain remains to be written. —RML<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Hanson, Henry. Winston Churchill<em>: A Biography of Historical Icon Winston Churchill.</em> La Verne, Tenn.: Ingram, 2020, 78 pp., hardbound, softbound, e-book. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/hanson-historical-icon/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: No contribution the Churchill corpus, this brief book lacks sourcing, endnotes, bibliography, index, glossaries, photographs and maps. With many gaps in the story, it reads like an extended encyclopedic entry or a rather long crib note. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Hett, Benjamin Carter. <i>The Nazi Menace: Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin, and the Road to War.</i> New York: Henry Holt, 2020, 416 pp., hardbound, softbound, e-book. ✸ </strong>Reviewed by Hillsdale: Hett sees parallels between 1930s globalist autocrats and those of today, reaffirming the preeminence of Churchill and Roosevelt in resisting totalitarianism. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Kandiah, Michael &amp; Rowbotham, Judith, eds.</strong><strong>, <em>The Diaries and Letters of Lord Woolton, 1940-1945. </em>Oxford: University Press for the British Academy, 2020, 352 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/kandiah-rowbotham-woolton/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> Very much a work about Churchill, Woolton&#8217;s diaries illuminate the complexity and problems of dealing with a high public profile figure like WSC, sure of his own importance and that of his own agenda in politics. A most welcome addition to the personal records from ministers and civil servants on Churchill’s wartime government. —AC</p>
<p><strong>Katz, Catherine Grace. <em>The Daughters of Yalta: The Churchills, Roosevelts, and Harrimans: A Story of Love and War</em>. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2020, 416 pp. Hardbound, softbound, audiobook, e-book. ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/katz-daughters-of-yalta/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> The story and experiences of three daughters who accompanied their distinguished fathers to the Yalta Conference in February 1945: Sarah Churchill, Anna Roosevelt and Kathleen Harriman. They played unique roles, scarcely noticed until this book. —Cita Stelzer</p>
<p><strong>Kluger, Michael and Evans, Richard. Roosevelt&#8217;s and Churchill&#8217;s Atlantic Charter: A Risky Meeting at Sea that Saved Democracy Hardcover. Barnsley, S. Yorkshire: Frontline, 2020, 248 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/kluger-evans-atlantic-charter/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The authors argue that the Atlantic meeting between a beleaguered Prime Minister and still officially neutral President was the defining moment of the Special Relationship, as the resulting Atlantic Charter set the moral standards for the postwar world order. They highlight the unsung supporting actors who made the meeting happen, including Harry Hopkins, George Marshall, Sumner Wells, Lord Beaverbrook, and Sir Alexander Cadogan. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Larson, Erik. <em>The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance during the Blitz</em>. London: Random House; New York: Crown, 2020, 546 pp. Also e-book. ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/larson-splendid-vile/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The popular historian has once more captured an epochal historical moment and brought it vividly to life in near-novelistic prose, yet without inventing a single thing. Dry-as-dust historians, often in the Academy, have a great deal to learn from writers such as Larson. They introduce the public to the splendor and terror of the past without compromising one iota on fact. —Andrew Robert</p>
<p><strong>Nester, William. <em>Winston Churchill and the Art of Leadership: How Winston Changed the World.</em> Barnsley, Yorks.: Frontline, 2020, 288 pp. Also e-book. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/nester-leadership/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> The common thread running through the book is Churchill’s capacity for maneuver in war and politics. Throughout his life Churchill found imaginative remedies to Britain’s political and military crises.Churchill revealed by Nester is a model of statesmanship: prescient and competent, but accompanied by certain errors of strategy. —Casey J. Wheatland</p>
<p><strong>Rafferty, Paul. <em>Winston Churchill Painting on the French Riviera. </em>London: Unicorn Publishing, 2020, 208 pp. ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/rafferty-riviera-painting/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A luxurious, landscape-format tribute to Churchill’s art and his favorite venue. The artist-author has thoroughly explored the Riviera, ferreting out the actual venues where WSC painted, showing how they look today in comparison with Churchill’s oils back in the day. Fastidiously researched and documented, this is a supreme achievement that adds much to our knowledge. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Reguer, Sara. </strong><em><strong><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">Winston S. Churchill and the Shaping of the Middle East, 1919-1922. </span></strong></em><span class="a-size-extra-large">Boston: Academic Studies Press, 2020, 238 pages. <strong> ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/reguer-middle-east/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: </span>Focuses on Churchill’s actions as the responsible minister, in reorganizing the Fertile Crescent, Palestine and Mesopotamia (modern Israel, Jordan, and Iraq) after the great war. Less broad in coverage, but a worthwhile supplement to David Fromkin&#8217;s <em>A Peace to End All Peace</em> (1989). —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Smith, Gary Scott. <em>Duty and Destiny: The Life and Faith of Winston Churchill</em>. Grand Rapids, Mich.: William Eerdmans Publishing, 2020, 256 pp. ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/smith-duty-destiny/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> As an examination of Churchill’s views on religion this is an excellent account. Attempting to prove whether he was a Christian or not is in the end a sterile debate. He was a great human being. That is all that needs to be said. —Robin Brodhurst</p>
<p><strong>Toye, Richard. <em>Winston Churchill: A Life in the News</em>. </strong><strong>Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020, 386 pp. Also e-book. ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/toye-life-news/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Churchill’s relations with the press here involve mainly British media, so misses, for example, his first great news controversy, the 1895 Cuban revolt. The book promises to show how Churchill’s “autocratic and repressive instincts against journalistic freedom were successfully contained.” But the case that WSC was against journalistic freedom is so weak as to be non-existent. Churchill doesn’t come off as any more thin-skinned about the press than any other politician, then or now. —McM</p>
<p><strong>Vale, J. Allister and Scadding, John W. <em>Winston Churchill’s Illnesses 1886-1965.</em> Barnsley, Yorks.: Frontline, 2020, 522 pp. ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/vale-scadding-health/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A thoroughgoing forensic examination of Churchill’s maladies from boyhood to old age that must be the standard work in this field. Combines professional commentary with layman’s terms, so no reader will be lost in medical technology. The copious index provides names of diseases and drugs as well as people and places, and the images include many physicians mentioned. No serious Churchill scholar will now be able routinely to quote Lord Moran (1966) without acknowledging the decisive caveats introduced by this new work. —AC</p>
<p><strong>Wynn, Stephen. <em>Churchill’s Flawed Decisions: Errors in Office of the Greatest Briton</em>. </strong><strong>Barnsley, Yorks.: Pen and Sword, 2020, 172 pp. Also e-book. ✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/forman-flawed-decisions/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Despite inadequate sourcework, Wynn takes a human view of Churchill to offer an examination of his “flawed decisions.” Not really a hit book, rather the author’s concept of legitimate criticism, but limited with easy moralizing and personal opinion based more on impressions than facts. —David Forman</p>

<p><strong>Brooke, Miranda.</strong> <strong><em>Wayward Daughter: Sarah Churchill and Her World</em></strong><strong>. Stroud, Glos.: Amberley Publishing, 2021, 384 pp. </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/brooke-wayward-daughter/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> Brooke has paved the way for the next author who attempts a biography of Sarah by uncovering a great deal of material, including some wonderful photographs, that might have been overlooked. For that we owe her thanks. —Cita Stelzer</p>
<p><strong>Buckey, Christopher M. <em>Genesis of the Grand Fleet: The Admiralty, Germany, and the Home Fleet, 1896-1914.</em> Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2021, 392 pp.</strong> <strong>✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/buckey-grand-fleet/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> With much on Churchill and Fisher, Buckey studied pre-Great War naval strategy and technology in a perceptive critique of revisionist historians and a re-affirmation of the long established works of Arthur Marder. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>English, Otto. <em>Fake History: Ten Great Lies and How They Shaped the World</em>. London: Welbeck, 2021, 320 pp. </strong><strong>✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/otto-english-ten-lies/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> Insofar as Churchill goes, this is a work of history. The writing doesn’t inspire confidence and is, rather, an inaccurate and mean-spirited political polemic. —Herbert Anderson</p>
<p><strong>Heffer, Simon. <em>Henry ‘Chips’ Channon: The Diaries 1918-1938. </em>London: Hutchinson, 2021, 1024 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/heffer-chips-channon/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a><strong>: </strong>An indispensable improvement on the original 1967 version. &#8220;For all his misogyny, anti-Semitism, anti-Americanism, Nazi sympathies and snobbery, Chips Channon was an inspired diarist. After devouring this volume readers will be anxious for the next. —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>_____ _____. <em>Henry &#8216;Chips&#8217; Channon: The Diaries 1938-43. </em>London: Hutchinson, 2021, 1098 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/channon-diaries2/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Channon, a superb diarist, had an extraordinary ability to capture and present the interesting. One can only admire the energy it must have taken simply to make hand-written daily, mostly lengthy, entries, amidst the social whirlwind in which he lived. Two thousand pages in, and we are left yearning for more. Luckily a third, and final, installment is due out later this year. —Dave Turrell</p>
<p><strong>Ireland, Josh. <em>Churchill &amp; Son. </em>New York: Dutton, 2021, 464 pp.</strong> <strong>✸</strong> <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/josh-ireland-churchill-son/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Randolph emerges as a dynamic speaker, a brilliant journalist, a gallant soldier, a skilled biographer, a frustrated son—and an honest man: as honest about himself, as he was of others. Not so bad an epitaph, after all. —RML</p>

<p><strong>Lee, Celia and Lee, John. <em>The Churchills: A Family Portrait</em>. London: Lume Books. 2021, 416pp., paperback.</strong> ✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/churchills-lee/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Revised edition of the 2010 hardback emphasizing the roles of Winston’s parents and brother Jack. Based on underutilized sources, including papers of family and friends, but oddly promoting Jennie’s supposed Native American heritage. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Sandys, Celia. <em>Churchill’s</em></strong><strong><em> Little Redhead</em></strong> <strong>(Stroud, Glocs.: Fonthill Media, 2021), 306 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/sandys-little-redhead/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A charming memoir of a life well-lived by Sir Winston&#8217;s granddaughter, built around her relationship with the great man. This is a tale of a loving and forgiving, mature woman who has experienced all that life can give, both pleasures and pains. —Cita Stelzer</p>
<p><strong>Soames, Emma, ed., <em>Mary Churchill’s War: The Wartime Diaries of Churchill’s Youngest Daughter</em><em>. </em>London: Two Roads-Hachette, 2021. 416 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/mary-churchills-war/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: Mary was 17 when war broke out. She watched her father as he wrote his wartime speeches; joined him his tours of Blitzed cities. She was his aide-de-camp at Quebec and Potsdam, stayed in  White House. Fortunately for historians, she also kept a diary: essentially a daily love letter from a brave young woman to her adored father. Immensely evocative of wartime Britain they are occasionally powerfully moving, but also historically important. —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Trethewey, Rachel. </strong><strong><em>The Churchill Girls: The Story of Winston’s Daughters</em></strong><strong>. Cheltenham, Glos.: The History Press, 2021, 320 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/trethewey-churchill-girls/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a><strong>: </strong>A well-researched, useful addition to the family history. Eschewing old newspaper gossip columns, Trethewey relies on the Churchill Archives Centre to provide an authoritative portrait. —Raymond A. Callahan</p>
<p><strong>Tucker-Jones, Anthony.  </strong><strong><em>Churchill, Master and Commander: Winston Churchill at War 1895-1945.</em></strong><strong> New York: Osprey, 2021, 384 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/tucker-jones-master-commander/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: A readable and critical account of Churchill as warlord. While worth considering, not all his criticisms are convincing. He correctly observes that Churchill took many a proverbial beating, from which he emerged still optimistic. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Wheatcroft, Geoffrey. <em>Churchill’s Shadow: The Life and Afterlife of Winston Churchill</em><em>. </em>London: Bodley Head; New York: Norton, 2021, 640 pp.</strong>  <strong>✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/wheatcroft-churchills-shadow/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>: The author declares this is not by intention, nor consciously revisionist, or contrarian. He then launches  into a long book that is virtually uninterrupted in its hostility to Winston Churchill, his memory, and especially anyone who has had the temerity to admire Churchill or learn lessons from his life and career. —Andrew Roberts</p>
<p><strong>Whitworth, Kieran. <em>The Churchill Quiz Book. </em>London: Osprey, 2021, 258 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/whitworth-quiz-book/">Reviewed by Hillsdale</a>:A highly accurate collectilon of questions about Churchill from easy softballs to serious brain-twisters, wonderful grist for scholars and the casual alike. —Robin Brodhurst</p>

If there were indeed a Churchill cult, it has done a singularly bad job of drowning out criticism of its hero. —Andrew Roberts</p>

In reality, he strove for a &#8220;lodgment&#8221; on the continent from 1941 on, and without him, the invasion would have been harder. —RML</p>
<p><strong>Downing, Taylor.</strong> <strong><em>1942:</em></strong><strong> <em>Winston Churchill and Britain’s Darkest Hour</em></strong><strong><em>.</em> New York and London: Pegasus, 2022. 432 pp. </strong>✸ <a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/downing-1942/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> Downing convincingly contends despite the widespread belief 1940 was the &#8220;Darkest Hour,&#8221; this is more accurately applied to 1942 when British arms and Churchill’s reputation were globally pounded until Churchill’s legendary perseverance and<br/>
American aid narrowly turned the tide of war. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Faught, C. Brad. <em>Cairo 1921: Ten Days That Made The Middle East</em>. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2022,</strong> <strong>264 pp. ✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/faught-cairo-1921/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> A well-researched centenary re-examination of the famous Cairo Conference. With mixed results at best, Faught argues, the conference was, more progressive and less imperialist-minded than is commonly believed. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Kershaw, Robert. <em>Dünkirchen 1940: The German View of Dunkirk. </em>Oxford: Osprey, 2022, 354 p. ✸ </strong>Reviewed by Hillsdale: A gritty, innovative, and almost real time reinterpretation based on German archival sources. Churchill’s epic leadership somewhat obscured Hitler’s failure to due to focusing farther south, and the Dunkirk area’s unsuitability for tank warfare. —WJS</p>
<p><strong>Liddle, Andrew. <em>Cheers, Mr. Churchill! </em>Winston Churchill in Scotland. Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2022. 274 pp.</strong> <strong>✸ </strong><a href="https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/liddle-cheers/">Reviewed by Hillsdale:</a> Covers Scotland&#8217;s profound impact in providing Churchill with a constituency (Dundee), a wife, and a battalion of Scottish soldiers to command. This excellent book also explores Churchill’s position on Scottish and Irish Home Rule (devolution). It is nicely complemented by the local focus of Tony Patterson’s <em>A Seat for Life</em> (1980). —WJS</p>

Lloyd George in the First World War and Churchill in the Second were right for the task. Both managed to gain the support of their citizens. Once that is accomplished, Prior concludes, “democracies at war can be fearsome.” —Cyril Mazansky</p>

Harassed by suffragettes and bedeviled by labor strikes, he nevertheless achieved prison reforms and proved himself administratively and politically suitable for high office. —WJS</p>

<p><strong>Faught, C. Brad Faught. <em>Churchill and Africa: Empire, Decolonisation and Race.</em> Yorkshire and Philadelphia: Pen and Sword Military, 2023, 188 pp. ✸ </strong>Reviewed by Hillsdale: First full study of the subject.

Hillsdale College was founded in 1844 by men and women who proclaimed themselves “grateful to God for the inestimable blessings resulting from the prevalence of civil and religious liberty and intelligent piety in the land,” and who believed that “the diffusion of sound learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.” It was the first American college to prohibit in its charter any discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin.

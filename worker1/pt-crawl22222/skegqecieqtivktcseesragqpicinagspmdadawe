<h2>Description</h2></a>
<P>Before the <a href="ae.html">United Arab Emirates</a>, there was an attempt to form a Federation of Arab Emirates which would have included <a href="bh.html">Bahrain</a> and <a
href="kw.html">Kuwait</a> in with the so-called <a href="ae-.html">Trucial States</a>. I believe its flag was proposed as horizontally red-white-red (proportions something like 1:2:1) with a green nine-pointed (seven-pointed, according to <i>James Dignan</i>, as Bahrain and Kuwait did not join) star in the centre.<i><br>
Roy Stilling</i>, 20 November 1995</p>
<p>This was the official flag of the Trucial States Council, and not a proposal. The stripes were in fact 1:2:1. The flag in FOTW is now correct, except that the star's points were slightly shorter, but that was never fixed, as far as I know. I do not know the correct proportions, but I think they were 2:3, as the picture we have [at the <i>Archiv f&uuml;r Flaggenkunde</i>] is in those proportions, and the photocopy of the photograph of the Trucial States Levy's flag we have shows the flag also being 2:3. There also was a naval flag and a war flag for the Council, but I have to look up in our files.<br>
<i>Ralf Stelter</i>, 19 April 1999</p>
<p>According to <a href="bib-pea.html#ped71">Pedersen 1971</a>, page 63, the seven Sheiks of the Trucial States formed a Council and this was the unofficial flag of that Council. That is the reason for the seven point star.<i><br>
Yosef Obskura</i> quoted by <i>&#381;eljko Heimer</i>, 26 April 1999</p>
<p>Wikipedia shows this flag at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Trucial_States.svg#filelinks">

<br>
Size of white (center) stripe appears about twice as high as that of the red 
(top or bottom) stripe 1:2:1 <br>
The star (centered) --less modern - one might say 'fatter'-- approaches a more 
golden color.<br>
<i>John Horvath Jr.</i>, 24 December 2009</p>
<p>I have &quot; The International Flag Book in colour&quot; by Christian Fogd Pedersen 
published in 1971 in Denmark which shows the exactly same image presented here.
<br>
The flag proportion : 2 : 3, The horizontal stripe proportion : 1 : 2: 1. The 
number of star points: seven in green<br>

<p>The world affairs blog &quot;<a href="http://cominganarchy.com/">Coming Anarchy</a>&quot; 
has begun a series on the flags of Arabia, with the first article covering &quot;The 
Trucial States of the Persian Gulf&quot; (the modern day UAE). It explains that the 
white in the various states' flags was imposed by the British to indicate the 
states' peaceful relations to patrolling naval vessels. <br>

<br>
So nothing particularly new so far, but it'll be interesting to see what else 
they come up with in this series.<br>

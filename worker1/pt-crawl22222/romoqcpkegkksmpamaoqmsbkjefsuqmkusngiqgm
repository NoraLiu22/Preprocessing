		<div class="comment">I want to thank you somewhat late for your good service and selection. I ordered a pair of overalls to wear in Afghanistan and received them promptly and at a good price. I have to drive in open vehicle every morning and the temps average 10-15' until about 9am. These have made the work enjoyable instead of miserable. I will look to you in the future as my needs require. Thanks ,</div>

		<div class="comment">Love Love Love your company! I ordered from you last year at Christmas time and got a great value in a very short amount of time. Even had an exchange and that was even smooth! Ordered again this week and once again you have outdone yourselves with your fast shipping! Not to mention the selection of big and tall sizes that you offer! Thank you so much!</div>

I just used the $20.00 gift card that I received from you when I made my last purchase, that was such a nice "perk".  Thank you again, Sincerely,</div>

		<div class="comment">Hello, I am just writing to tell your company what an amazing place I think you have. I had a nightmare situation with another online retailer who ran me all around the world to get a pair of pants and over a month later when they finally arrived in the mail they were the wrong size. We REALLY needed these coveralls, and because of the ackward size, they were impossible to find in any store, even near us (we are located in the Boston area). I called your store and spoke with the nicest salesperson I have ever dealt with, Joe. He personally went and checked to see if the store had the size and color I was looking for, which you did, and then told me to order them online and he would process the order right away. This is probably the first time in my life that a salesperson has done exactly what they promised. My order was processed within 15 minutes, and within 3-4 hours I already had a tracking number for UPS. I ordered them on wednesday and they are scheduled to arrive tomorrow, friday (yes 2 days later) and I just want to say that I think you have an amazing company, and with staff as helpful and friendly as Joe, you will go very far with your business. Thank you for everything you have done. ...a thankful girlfriend and her grateful plumber boyfriend who will really appreciate being warm during these Northeast snow storms with lined coveralls from your store. :)</div>

Thank goodness, you saved the day.  Cliff loves Carhart jackets, he lives in Carson City NV where they are expecting 14" of snow!  Being that you are located in Geneva you know what snow is all about. Thank you again for your excellent service and we wish you a joyful Thanksgiving.</div>

		<div class="comment">I just spoke to someone about changing this from a size "8" to an "8.5".  Thank you for making this change so promptly.<br><br> FYI.  Before I purchased from you, I checked you out with the BBB and found that you have an A+ rating and no complaints in that last 3 years.  That's very unusual any business, but especially for an internet business.  Also, most companies on the internet NEVER let you speak to a human being, but I was able to reach someone in just a few rings.  She was very friendly and fast.  That kind of quality service, along with your excellent prices is a great combination.  Please keep it up!  I'm going to tell my friend about your website.</div>

This is commendable given the time of year it is with the holiday.  Please express my gratitude to both your staff (and yourself) for making this happen.  As a first time customer, thank you!  Enjoy the season!<br><br> A Very Merry and Happy Customer,</div>

		<div class="comment">I just wanted to send a note to express how happy I have been doing business with Super Casuals.  It is too often that we get feedback about the negative things, I would like to take this opportunity to express the positive.  Three years ago, your company helped me out of a bind by getting me an order that I needed right away.  Since that time, I have and will order my husband's jeans from no other store.  You are fast, friendly, and have wonderful customer service.  I placed my yearly order on Monday, 11/30 and received it today [Ed. 12/2]. I just want to thank you and know that you have a loyal customer in Michigan!</div>

		<div class="comment">[Editor's note: Our apologies to those living on Long Island :)] It sure is refreshing to know that nice people and great customer service still exist!( I have been living on Long Island for too long-nearly 10 years-and  have to admit I have become distastefully jaded by the lack of basic, good-natured people here. It seems as though courtesy doesn't come naturally for what ever reason. I'm accustomed to WNY friendly folks-where I grew up. So thanks for making my day!)</div>

This is my 4th order from here and I have always been more than satisfied with everything.  It is almost impossible to find a Levis 38X36 jean and you always seem to have them in stock.  Your response time is incredible, I always track them with the tracking number and every time I order they get shipping on the same day and are at my door in Iowa in 3-4 days.  Again thanks for everything and you now have a life time customer</div>

		<div class="comment">Dear Sir: Less than 10 days before Christmas, I decided to order Carhartt coveralls for my son.  I tried to place an order from a national department store catalog but the coveralls were unavailable.  Then I found your website online and decided to order them from you.  The girl that answered the phone got up and checked to see if the size I needed was in stock and is was, so she said she would ship it to me the same day. I added a pair of Carhartt socks with my order to bring it to over $100 and I received free shipping.   I received my order 2 days later and saved approximately $70 from the department store catalog's price. This e-mail is to thank you for your prompt shipping and great price!  I really appreciated it. Thanks,</div>

		<div class="comment">Dear Friends, Thank you so much for your attention to my order and my needs. It is a pleasure doing business with a concern like yours that cares what customers think. I will recommend you to my friends. Vermonters still buy winter clothing in spite of global warming. With the price of gas going up daily, it costs a lot of money to drive long distances to stores -- maybe to find out that they don't stock the desired item. Internet-based shopping will increase and I hope good people [and neighbors] like you will profit from it. Sincerely,</div>

I was skeptical about adding 4 inches to the waist and taking 2 away for the length but ordered them that way  and they are perfect! I placed my order on Jan 22nd and received it the 23rd!  That was the best service I ever received from an internet store!  Thanks for doing a great job!

I have been searching for a particular type of workshirt that I was previously able to obtain at a local outlet of a nationally known retailer. They no longer carry this product so I was very pleased to find basically the same thing in your store. Actually,I like it even more. I ordered one around 3 weeks ago,received it only 3 days later and I have just ordered 3 more (5 minutes ago). You also carry a model and size of Lee jeans that I have trouble getting at times. Your store isn't exactly around the corner from my house so the internet shopping is ideal. You have obviously set up your site properly and in a "safe" manner, so I feel very comfortable using it.</div>

		<div class="comment"> Dear people,<br><br> I established an account with you folks just before Christmas 2005, but I don't know my Customer ID number. However, I do want to go on record in giving the following testimony: I was placing my order(s), backorder(s) and returns during the holiday season between Thanksgiving and through the middle of January. I was using your Website to make my choices and to place my order(s). Obviously, this is the busiest and most demanding period of the year in attempting to conduct business in the manner I was. Most of the articles I ordered were gifts for others. When it comes to getting gifts for anyone, I am very meticulous and compelled to do my very best in matching the gifts with the people for whom I am buying them. Consequently, I made several mistakes in choosing sizes and in some other choices I made. Nonetheless, in my efforts to acquire the merchandise and use the service you offer and provide, I created a complex situation for us both. I, also, lost track and became confused of the transactions we had conducted, even though I had made copies of the orders, the confirmations and the finances involved. It was only by the professionalism, in conjunction with a very friendly, understanding and cooperative service staff, was it ever possible for everything to fall into place in the end. The lady in the accounting department was very patient, effective and efficient in utilizing her expertise in order for the billing to be done in a fair and equitable manner in regards to both our interests. It is, now, the middle of May and I want to purchase a Carhartt jacket, for myself and a pair of jeans as a gift. I did not hesitate as to where I am going to buy them or am I going to conduct any comparison of pricing with any others. I am going straight to your Website stored in my Bookmarks and begin to put together, again, an Internet order. It seems, under the circumstances described above and the resolution thereof, saying "Thank you" or "I appreciate the kind, friendly and professional service." isn't enough. Therefore, I hope repeat service and word of mouth will, along with this note of praise, will suffice for now. I am reminded of a response my dad used to make when he wanted to express his gratefulness to someone. "Thank you, until you're better paid.<br><br> Sincerely and respectfully,</div>

The orders have been processed, shipped and on my doorstep in a unbelievably short time. I would much rather order from you than drive an hour up the road to a large chain sports store (Gander Mountain) for my Carhartt clothing. It is a pleasure doing business with you. Great Service, Fast Shipping and Fair Prices..all from my easy chair.. shopping just doesn't get better than this!</div>

		<div class="comment"> I just want to thank you for the absolutely wonderful service.   I could not believe I actually received the Carhartt Jacket for my granddaughter's birthday in California in 2 days! Its the exact one she wanted.  Had it just in time for the cold days and nights at the swine show. Oh, by the way, she found the note you put on the invoice wishing her a happy birthday and good luck at the show. I definitely will be doing business with you in the future.<br><br> (Editor's Note: The pig's name is Sandy!)</div>

		<div class="comment"> Thank you so much for providing web access to your store. My friend, Richard, received his order today and from the call I got from him he is very pleased. He scoured this town for that jacket, a regular part of his wardrobe. So did I, and a few weeks ago I found your site on the Internet and told him I could order it online. Well, he's about an old timer and didn't have much faith in my offer. But finally he conceded when I showed him the jacket on your site, and told him I had called to confirm you had the jacket in stock. After checking a few more possible merchants, where he tried on the vest for size, he let me make the order. I was very impressed with the same day email response from you letting me know you had shipped the order. Thank you very much for providing such great customer service. I look forward to supporting your business in the future.</div>

		<div class="comment"> Wanted you to know your prices on Carhardt merchandise is great and your service is even better. You now have a new customer. I have placed 2 orders with you so far and the process is so easy. Merchandise was received remarkable fast. My son is very tall and when ever I buy him a Carhardt sweatshirt it is too short. I am so pleased to see you have Tall sizes. My son was thrilled when he received his 1st shirt from you store. It fit him perfect. Thank you so much.</div>

My husband LOVED the boots so much he returned the pair he had bought a week earlier. And his brother liked them so much he asked me for your website so his wife can get a pair for him for Christmas. You guys should be proud. Your customer service is incredible and I will be coming back again as well as referring folks to your site! Keep up the great work!

Every penny counts, and when you charge $10 LESS than the manufacturer, and I STILL get it direct from them, I have no reason not to be FULLY impressed with your company, recommend you to others, and continue to patronize your "store." AWESOME work!  Keep it up!</div>

		<div class="comment"> Please let me take a moment to thank you for all your help with my recent purchases. I admit I now do the bulk of my purchasing (including furniture for my new home) online and rarely have the opportunity to interact with the merchant's I'm ordering from, so was delighted when I called your shop and was given straightforward answers to my questions. You went above and beyond my expectations for &quot;customer service&quot;, especially when I needed to exchange the items for other sizes. It was a delight to meet you and I look forward to speaking with you again. As I suspect my son will continue to need &quot;Carhartt&quot; products, you have us as lifetime customers.</div>

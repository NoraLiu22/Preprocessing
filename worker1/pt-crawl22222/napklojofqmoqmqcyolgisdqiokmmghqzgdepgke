<p class="style16" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">New York City. They were representing members of Critical Mass, a group a cyclists who organize large bicycle rides in Manhattan. The riders claimed that they had been wrongly detained and arrested by officers during events occurring from 2004 to 2006. </p>
<p class="style16" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style16" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The plaintiff&rsquo;s attorneys were able to demonstrate how absurdly out of proportion the police&rsquo;s presence had been compared to any possible threat or disturbance. One police response plan for a ride in October 2004, for instance, included 547 officers, 81 sergeants, 29 lieutenants and a dozen captains. To track the fast-moving ride, the department employed a helicopter and more than 100 scooters and bicycles.

<p class="style8">The Los Angeles firm of Litt, Estuar, Harrison, &amp; Kitson has successfully sued the city of Long Beach, California on behalf of Thomas Goldstein for $7.95 million. Mr. Goldstein had been convicted in 1979 of murder. The conviction was primarily based on a jailhouse informant who testified that Mr. Goldstein had confessed to him. Two federal judges and a federal appeals panel eventually ruled that Goldstein was wrongly convicted, and he was freed in 2004.</p>
<p class="style8">It turned out that the informant had been offered benefits in exchange for his testimony, something that the informant had denied in his testimony. Even after this denial, the police did not inform the trial prosecutor of the benefits. Long Beach&rsquo;s head prosecutor also knew of the informant&rsquo;s deal. </p>

<p class="style16" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">When the plaintiff was found innocent of the charges he was being held on, the detention officer then charged the plaintiff with assault.

The suit was filed on behalf of 486 former detainees at the prison who were strip searched upon entering prison as well as each time they left for court appearances.

<p class="style8">Oakland Attorneys John Burris and James Chanin have obtained a $6.5 million settlement from the City of Oakland. Their clients were 104 people who had been the targets of search warrants.</p>
<p class="style8">Burris and Chanin filed their case in 2008 when it was discovered that for many years Oakland police officers were claiming that drugs allegedly obtained from informants were tested and served as the bases for obtaining a search warrant from a judge. The drugs were never tested. In many cases innocent people including women and children were treated harshly and in some cases terrorized, according to Burris. </p>
<p class="style8">Chanin notes that <span style="color:black;">the Oakland Police Department&rsquo;s own records reveal that from 2001 to 2008, over 57 percent of all &ldquo;X-Buy&rdquo; warrants (warrants based on an alleged drug buy involving a confidential police informant&rdquo;) obtained by OPD officers on file were based on false information or outright perjury.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="style16" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">When Sauger was arrested, police said that the photojournalist lacked a temporary media credential for the event that had been issued to some news photographers earlier in the day. When he was detained by officers, Sauger was standing in a media area and was wearing his regular press credentials while carrying and using professional photography equipment.</span></p>
<p class="style16" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style16" style="margin-top:0;">In exchange for a smaller monetary reward, Toledo&rsquo;s Police Department agreed to change its policies regarding the media. <span style="color:black;">Hurwitz said that the Police Department policy changes should reduce the possibility of arbitrary and unfair arrests of journalists in the future. According to the settlement and its policy changes, the Toledo Police Department must now recognize all legitimate news media at newsworthy public events. The police have also changed their policy regarding who is considered a &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; member of the news media and how officers are directed to interact with the news media. The new policy now prohibits police from erasing or destroying images on photographers' cameras.</span><span style="font-size:16px;"></span></p>

<p class="style8">In June of 2010, the firm of Rothstein, Donatelli, Hughes, Dahlstrom, Schoenburg &amp; Bienvenu in Santa Fe, New Mexico settled a wrongful death case for $1 million. The victim was a 23 year-old Hispanic man with no criminal history who had been arrested for misdemeanor criminal damage to property while high on cocaine. After being handcuffed without resistance, he refused to get into the police car. </p>
<p class="style8">At this point two of the four officers present tasered the victim on the orders of their sergeant. After being tasered 23 times, his ankles were shackled and he was placed face down across the back seat. Then a 200 lb. officer sat on the victim&rsquo;s upper back in violation of the police&rsquo;s written procedures. When they arrived at the jail, the victim was dead. </p>
<p class="style8">The state pathologist found the cause of death to be excited delirium resulting from cocaine intoxication, while the officers&rsquo; means of restraint &ldquo;significantly contributed to the death.&rdquo; The manner of death was labeled a homicide. Three of the officers, including the sergeant, were indicted by a grand jury, but the charges were later dropped. </p>

<p class="style8">Mr. Gibbs, who is now 62 years old and fighting colon cancer, had spent over 18 years in prison after being framed for the murder of a prostitute in 1986. He was framed by Louis Eppolito, a notoriously corrupt Brooklyn officer. Eppolito was working for the Luchese mob family at the time.

<p class="style8">Woodman, who was 22 years old, was leaving a bar with friends when they passed nine police officers standing at a corner. Woodman joked that &ldquo;there seems to be a lot of crime on this corner.&rdquo; He was holding a beer at the time, and the officers then immediately arrested him. While cuffing him, they pushed him faced down on the ground. When his mother saw him later at the hospital, she said there were cuts all over his face from the pavement. </p>
<p class="style8">Only after Woodman had been lying facedown, cuffed, and not moving did the police flag down a passing ambulance. His parents said he must have been unable to breath for at least four minutes due to the extensive brain damage he suffered. Woodman died days later at the hospital. </p>
<p class="style8">Woodman&rsquo;s parents will use the settlement to start a foundation in David&rsquo;s name at Emmanuel College, where he went to school. <span style="color:black;">&quot;David was active within Boston, tutoring young students and being a friend to those who lived on the streets. He cared deeply about people who are poor, homeless or looked down on by society,'' his parents said. &quot;The foundation started in his name will continue David&rsquo;s work by providing empathy, compassion and support to people who are often ignored in this world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="style8">A federal appeals court upheld the $3.7 million in damages won by NPAP Board member and attorney John Burris. Burris was representing a parolee named Torry Smith. Smith had sued the city of Oakland and two police offers for false arrest in 2008.</p>
<p class="style8">In 2004 the two officers came to Mr. Smth&rsquo;s home to question him about a connection they believed he had with a drug dealer. They arrested Smith and booked him on a charge of possessing a semiautomatic weapon that they said they<br/>
found in his yard. Prosecutors dropped the gun charge, but authorities kept Smith in jail as a possible parole violator for four and a half months.</p>

<p class="style8" style="margin-bottom: 0;">The city of Portland, Oregon agreed to a $1.6 million settlement over the death of James Chasse Jr. It is the city's largest payout for a civil tort claim. The family of Chasse is represented by the firm of <span style="color:black;">Steenson Schumann Tewksbury Creighton and Rose. </span></p>
<p class="style8" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="style8" style="margin-top:0;"><span style="color:black;">James Chasse Jr. was a 42-year-old mentally ill man. In September of 2006, he was arrested by three Portland police officers who believed he was urinating in public, though there was no evidence of this. The officers chased Chasse, slamming him to the pavement and struggled to cuff him. </span>The medical examiner said he died of broad-based blunt-force trauma to the chest. An autopsy revealed that he had 26 breaks to 16 ribs, some of which punctured a lung. Medical experts said Chasse was &quot;repeatedly and viciously punched, struck, kicked, kneed in the head, back, ribs and chest&rdquo; as well as being shot numerous times by a stun gun. Medics did not take him to a hospital, saying Chasse's vital signs were normal. However, jail staff refused to book him because of his physical condition. Chasse died while being taken to the hospital in a police car.</p>
<p class="style8">The three officers not only inflicted this physical violence, but also tried to justify their actions once they realized that there were numerous witnesses. They announced that a bag a bread crumbs on Chasse was cocaine and that he was a transient with prior cocaine convictions and presently high. All of these pronouncements were lies. </p>
<p class="style8">The attorneys for the Chasse family were also able to reach a settlement with the county for $925,000 and the ambulance company for $600,000. </p>

Before this, he had been living, working, raising his family and paying taxes in Ohio for eleven years.</p>
<p class="style8"><span style="color:black;">His attorney claimed that Mr. Rodriguez was &ldquo;seized&rdquo; when he was taken to the construction trailer at the worksite for interrogation in violation of the Fourth Amendment. He also alleged a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. In addition, Gerhardstein argued that the Sheriff did not have power to enforce the federal civil immigration law.</span></p>

Between July 1999 and October 2007, it is estimated that about 100,000 pretrial detainees were illegally searched when they first arrived and/or when they were coming back from court appearances. Some detainees were strip-searched multiple times. Two female plaintiffs were also forced to undergo gynecological exams. The victims faced misdemeanor charges, many no more serious than</span>jumping turnstiles, failing to pay child support, shoplifting and trespassing. </p>

<p class="style16" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Mariann Meier Wang, another attorney for the plaintiffs, called the settlement historic and the illegal strip searches a &quot;form of mass humiliation.&quot; She said they were designed to let inmates know who was in charge.

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:15px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;">The law firm of Friedman and Gilbert in Cleveland, Ohio settled the case of Mark McCullaugh who was arrested for disorderly conduct and assault after a confrontation with a police officer and placed in the Summit County Jail.&nbsp; McCullaugh had a history of bipolar disorder and delusional behavior. &nbsp;While at the jail&rsquo;s mental health unit, he displayed some bizarre behavior in his cell, and was bleeding from an old superficial cut on his hand. &nbsp;The doctor was called and advised that he be placed in a 4 point restraint chair and given a sedative. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:15px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:15px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;">There was no effort to assemble an extraction team with appropriate safety gear. &nbsp;At least 5 deputies went into the cell where Mark, at this point, was simply laying quietly on his bed. When he refused to get up, he was tased twice, and eventually overpowered. &nbsp;During the struggle, he was stomped on his head, then handcuffed and shackled with his chest on the metal bunk in a prone position. &nbsp;The deputies left and came back ten minutes later with a one pound riot control can of OC spray, and doused Mark with a 3-5 second spray on his back and neck. Then, they suited up and returned to find him not breathing and responsive. &nbsp;He was pronounced dead at the scene.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:15px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;"><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;">The deputies were indicted in state court. The most culpable deputy was tried first, but waived a jury and was acquitted. &nbsp;The other four deputies were dismissed. &nbsp;In the civil 1983 action, the attorneys challenged the policies, procedures and training. &nbsp;The Defendants hired a number of experts to say the death had nothing to do with the force used, but was due to a pre-existing heart condition and/or excited delirium. &nbsp;Summary judgment motions by Plaintiff and Defendants had been filed when the case went to mediation.&nbsp; The case was eventually settled for $862,500.</span></span></p>

<h2 class="style5">Landmark victory in wrongful conviction case affirmed</h2>
<p class="style8"><strong><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:15px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:15px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;"><span class="style7"><span style="color:black;"></span></span></span></span></span></span></strong>On August 27, 2009 the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed a landmark verdict for four men framed by the FBI for a murder they did not commit.&nbsp; The appellate judges wrote that the 2007 damages judgment of $101.7 million by US District Judge Nancy Gertner was considerably higher than they would have ordered &ldquo;but when we take into account the severe emotional trauma inflicted upon the scapegoats, we cannot say with any firm conviction that those awards are grossly disproportionate to the injuries sustained.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style8">The case was litigated by a team of lawyers, among them NPAP&rsquo;s Howard Friedman and Michael Avery.&nbsp; Avery calls it &ldquo;the most sordid and shocking case that I came across in nearly four decades of litigating law enforcement misconduct.&rdquo;&nbsp; The FBI agents had suborned perjury, framed four men and conspired to keep them in jail for over thirty years. &nbsp;The four men, Joseph Salvati, Peter J. Limone, Louis Greco and Henry Tameleo, were implicated in the murder of Edward Deegan by Joe Barboza, the FBI&rsquo;s star witness and mafia hit man, who himself was involved in killing Deegan.&nbsp; Based on Barboza&rsquo;s testimony, which the FBI knew to be false, Limone, Tameleo, and Greco were sentenced to death, Salvati to life in prison. &nbsp;The death sentences were reduced to life imprisonment when the death penalty was vacated.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style8">Tameleo and Greco died in prison in 1985 and 1995, respectively. &nbsp;Salvati was freed in 1997 when then Governor Weld commuted his sentence.&nbsp; In 2001, after a lengthy investigation into the Boston office of the FBI, Limone was released and a new trial concluded that there was no good faith basis to further prosecute the defendant. &nbsp;Based on this investigation, all four men were eventually exonerated. &nbsp;The civil lawsuit against the FBI was filed in 2002.</p>

Cunningham secured a favorable Fourth Amendment ruling from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia involving protestors arrested at the September, 2002 IMF protests in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; The defendant, a U.S. Marshal for the Washington, D.C. Superior Court strip searched the protestors just prior to their court appearances and release. &nbsp;The federal district court denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, holding that </span><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;">blanket strip searches of non-violent, non-felony arrestees were unlawful at the time of the searches in September, 2002. </span></span></p>

<p class="style8">On Friday, July 10, 2009 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has ruled to end the checkpoints run by D.C. police in neighborhoods high in crime.

NPAP members Mara Verheyden-Hilliard and Carl Messineo, attorneys for the Partnership for Civil Justice, represented the plaintiffs. The ruling was the reversal of a previous decision made by U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon. The case has been sent back to the lower court for further proceedings.</p>

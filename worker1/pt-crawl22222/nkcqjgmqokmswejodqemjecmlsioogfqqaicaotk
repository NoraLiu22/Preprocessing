<p class="bodytext">This notification relates to the uae-business-directory.com website only, and does not include the websites that can be accessed using the links.</p>
<h2>1. Types of details handled and reasons for handling</h2>
<h3>1.1 Navigation data</h3>
<p class="bodytext">No information is gathered that makes it possible to identify the user (like name, surname, and e-mail address), unless the user is asked to provide the same.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Information such as the time of day, browser type, language used by the browser, and the IP address for each access to the site is acquired and saved.&nbsp; These details may be compared with records available to the site and used in order to extract anonymous statistical information on use of the site as well as for checking that it is working properly, with a view to optimising the services offered via the site.</p>
<h3>1.2 Data provided voluntarily by the user</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Sending of e-mail messages to the addresses indicated on the website, which is entirely optional and voluntary, results in acquisition of the sender’s address as well as any other data contained in the e-mail, in order to reply to requests.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Registration, which is entirely optional and voluntary, in any mailing lists results in the acquisition of at least the e-mail address to be able to provide updating services via e-mail (newsletter, technical updates, or information of some other type).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Registration online, which is entirely optional and voluntary, for conventions and events, results in the acquisition of the participant’s personal details (name, surname, address) for the purposes of organising the event.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Specific summary notifications may be displayed in the various sections of the website.</p>
<h3>1.2 Data provided voluntarily by the user</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Sending of e-mail messages to the addresses indicated on the website, which is entirely optional and voluntary, results in acquisition of the sender’s address as well as any other data contained in the e-mail, in order to reply to requests.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Registration, which is entirely optional and voluntary, in any mailing lists results in the acquisition of at least the e-mail address to be able to provide updating services via e-mail (newsletter, technical updates, or information of some other type).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Registration online, which is entirely optional and voluntary, for conventions and events, results in the acquisition of the participant’s personal details (name, surname, address) for the purposes of organising the event.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Specific summary notifications may be displayed in the various sections of the website.</p>
<h3>1.3 Cookies</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Cookies are not used for sending information of a personal nature, nor as so-called persistent cookies of any kind used, that is, user tracing systems.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The use of so-called session cookies (that are not permanently saved on the user’s computer and disappear when the browser is closed) is strictly limited to the transmission of session identifiers (made up of casual numbers generated by the server), which are necessary for allowing safe, efficient exploration of the website.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The so-called session cookies used on the website avoid the use of other computer techniques that could potentially be prejudicial to the confidentiality of navigation by users and do not allow personal details to be gathered that identify the user.</p>
<h2>2. Nature of provision of details</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Apart from the indications given for navigation details, any provision of details is completely optional.&nbsp; The user is free to provide the personal details requested for the services offered online and failure to provide the same merely leads to it being impossible to obtain what has been requested.</p>
<h2>3. Means of Handling</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Specific security measures are taken to prevent the loss of details, illicit or incorrect use of the same, and unauthorised access.</p>
<h2>4. Entity Responsible for Handling</h2>
<p class="bodytext">The entities responsible for handling the detail are Alexander Tumler &amp; Helmuth Antholzer, both of which have their office at Bahnhofwiesen 6, I-39014 Burgstall – Tel +39 0473 290049, Fax +39 0473 291721 – e-mail address: <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('ocknvq,kphqBwcg/dwukpguu/fktgevqta0eqo');" title="info@uae-business-directory.com">info(at)uae-business-directory.com</a> </p>
<p class="bodytext">The details will be handled by the responsibles, or by anyone tasked with occasional site maintenance operations.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Details are not communicated or distributed.</p>
<h2>5. Rights of the Person Involved</h2>
<p class="bodytext">In terms of art 7 of Legislative Decree 196/03, “The person involved has the right to have the existence or lack of their personal details confirmed, even if they have not yet been recorded, and to have them communicated in a legible format”.</p>
<p class="bodytext">1. The person involved has the right to obtain an indication:<br />a) Of the source of their personal details.<br />b) Of the purpose and manner in which they are handled.<br />c) Of the logic applied in case of handling with the help of electronic equipment.<br />d) Of the details that identify the entity responsible, their managers, and the designated representative in terms of article 5, 2nd comma.<br />e) Of the subjects or categories of subjects to whom their personal details may be communicated or that may become aware of the same, as a designated representative within the State’s territory, managers, or appointed staff.</p>
<p class="bodytext">2. The person involved has the right to obtain:<br />a) Updating, correction or, when in their interests, the addition of details.<br />b) Deletion, transformation into an anonymous format, or the blockage of details handled in violation of the law, including those for which storing in relation to the purposes for which such details were gathered or subsequently handled is not necessary.<br />c) Confirmation that the operations referred to in letters a) and b) have been brought to the attention, also in relation to their content, of those to whom the details have been communicated or distributed, excepting for where such compliance is impossible or involves the use of means that are clearly disproportionate in relation to the right protected.</p>
<p class="bodytext">3. The person involved has the right to oppose, completely or partly:<br />a) For legitimate reasons, to handling of personal details that refer to them, albeit pertinent for the purpose for which they are gathered.<br />b) Handling of personal details that refer to them for the purposes of sending advertising or direct sales materials, or for running market research of commercial communications”.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Requests to exercise the rights indicated above must be addressed to <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('ocknvq,kphqBwcg/dwukpguu/fktgevqta0eqo');" title="info@uae-business-directory.com">info(at)uae-business-directory.com</a>.</p></div>

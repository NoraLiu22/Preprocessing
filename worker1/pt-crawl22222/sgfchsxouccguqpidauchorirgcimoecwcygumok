class="col-lg-9 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><p>This entry includes five subentries: <em>chief of state; head of government; cabinet; elections/appointments; election results</em>. <em>Chief of state</em> includes the name, title, and beginning date in office of the titular leader of the country who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. <em>Head of government</em> includes the name, title of the top executive designated to manage the executive branch of the government, and the beginning date in office. <em>Cabinet</em> includes the official name of the executive branch’s high-ranking body and the method of member selection. <em>Elections/appointments</em> includes the process for accession to office, date of the last election, and date of the next election. <em>Election results</em> includes each candidate&#x27;s political affiliation, percent of direct popular vote or indirect legislative/parliamentary percent vote or vote count in the last election.<br/><br/>
The executive branches in approximately 80% of the world&#x27;s countries have separate chiefs of state and heads of government; for the remainder, the chief of state is also the head of government, such as in Argentina, Kenya, the Philippines, the US, and Venezuela. Chiefs of state in just over 100 countries are directly elected, most by majority popular vote; those in another 55 are indirectly elected by their national legislatures, parliaments, or electoral colleges. Another 29 countries have a monarch as the chief of state. In dependencies, territories, and collectivities of sovereign countries - except those of the US - representatives are appointed to serve as chiefs of state.<br/><br/> 
Heads of government in the majority of countries are appointed either by the president or the monarch or selected by the majority party in the legislative body. Excluding countries where the chief of state is also head of government, in only a few countries is the head of government directly elected through popular vote.<br/><br/>
Most of the world&#x27;s countries have cabinets, the majority of which are appointed by the chief of state or prime minister, many in consultation with each other or with the legislature. Cabinets in only about a dozen countries are elected solely by their legislative bodies.</p><div class="pb30"><h3 class="mt10"><a href="/the-world-factbook/countries/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a></h3><strong>chief of state:</strong> overall Taliban Leader HAYBATULLAH Akhundzada serves as the head of the Taliban as Amir-ul Momineen and as such is seen by the Taliban as head of state; he resides and issues decrees from the city of Kandahar while the legacy government ministries operate from Kabul<br/><br/><strong>head of government:</strong> overall Taliban Leader HAYBATULLAH Akhundzada is the [so-called] Amir-ul Momineen of the Taliban and is seen by them as a head of government <p> </p><br/><br/><strong>cabinet:</strong> <p>the Taliban have announced a “cabinet” for the “caretaker government,” including the “acting prime minister,” “acting deputy prime ministers,” and “ministers” who claim to represent 26 ministries</p><br/><br/><strong>elections/appointments:</strong> the 2004 Afghan constitution directed that the president should be elected by majority popular vote for a 5-year term (eligible for a second term); election last held on 28 September 2019, and the Taliban have given no indication that they intend to reinstate elections or any other mechanism of democratic governance<br/><br/>note 1: the United States has not yet made a decision whether to recognize the Taliban or any other entity as the government of Afghanistan<br/>note 2: note - on 7 September 2021, the Taliban announced Mohammad HASSAN Akhund as the “acting prime minister” of the &quot;caretaker government”; as of November 2021, the group had announced three &quot;acting deputy prime ministers” - Abdul Ghani BARADER, Abdul Salam HANAFI, and Mohammad Abdul KABIR</div><div class="pb30"><h3 class="mt10"><a href="/the-world-factbook/countries/akrotiri-and-dhekelia/">Akrotiri and Dhekelia</a></h3><strong>chief of state:</strong> King CHARLES III (since 8 September 2022)<br/><br/><strong>head of government:</strong> Administrator Air Vice-Marshall Peter J.M.

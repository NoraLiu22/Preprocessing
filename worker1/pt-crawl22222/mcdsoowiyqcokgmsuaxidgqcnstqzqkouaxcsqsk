Unregulated Free Market Fundamentalism Zealotry <img src="/web/20070705213834im_/http://www.rgemonitor.com/images/premiumcontent.gif" width="14" height="10" alt="RGE premium content."> </h1><div class="createdate">Nouriel Roubini   | Mar 19, 2007</div>


<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The sub-prime and overall mortgage carnage is now likely to lead to a financial crisis whose cleanup and bailout costs will make the S&amp;L bailout bill look like spare change. We are only at the beginning of this fallout but, already, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070705213834/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ai0NF1.Z3P9M">several proposals and bills in Congress&nbsp;have been submitted to help millions of sub-prime homeowners on the verge of bankruptcy and foreclosure</a>. The prospect of millions of homeowners thrown homeless on the street is already shaking politicians of every stripe. The relatively <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070705213834/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apmL.3w.r52c">modest bailout envisaged by the first bills currently proposed in Congress</a> will mushroom into a much bigger fiscal bailout of homeowners, borrowers and lenders once the garbage of sub-prime, near-prime and pseudo-prime toxic waste spreads around the economy and likely leads to a hard landing recession&nbsp;that will cause a much bigger financial and banking crisis.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Given the fallout and real, social and financial costs of this disaster the political blame game will soon start. So it is important to make sure that the self-serving spin game that accompanied the game of those who happily ignored since last summer the looming housing, mortgage and economic mess will not be repeated again. Powerful political and financial interests will spin their self-serving ideological spin on who is to blame for this mess. Specifically be ready for a cabal of supply side voodoo ideologues - from the Wall Street Journal editorial page (and its invited op-ed writers) to hacks (calling them economists would be an insult to my profession) such as Arthur Laffer, Steve Hanke and other assorted voodoo religion priests - to start spinning a tale blaming government regulation and interference for this disaster that has instead its core in the lack of sensible government regulation, not the existence of such regulation. <span>&nbsp;</span>In the meanwhile powerful financial interests that repeat the mantra &ndash; or better the proof-less dogma - of unregulated free markets and do not like any &ndash; even sensible &ndash; supervision and regulation of the financial system will happily blame government action &ndash; rather than their own reckless greed and stupidity - for this disaster while happily demanding and receiving billions in bailout funds from the same government that they so happily disdain. This will be the<span>&nbsp;most appalling</span>&nbsp;form of corporate welfare: privatize the profits in good times and socialize the losses in bad times.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font>  <div style="float:right; width:300px;height:250px; margin:5px 0 5px 5px;padding:0px 0px;">

This voodoo religion cabal will also incorrectly blame regulators &ndash;<span>&nbsp; </span>whose true blame was being asleep at the wheel for six years while being drugged by a philosophy of &ldquo;laissez-faire&rdquo; non-interference with free markets while this free market garbage was being originated &ndash; for now finally starting to crack down on monstrous &ldquo;free market&rdquo; practices such as zero downpayments on mortgages or NINJA (No Income, No Jobs and Assets) loans; this cabal will thus now blame regulators for &ldquo;destroying&rdquo; the sub-prime and near-prime mortgage market with their intervention into &ldquo;self-regulating free markets&rdquo;. The same voodoo economics religion priests has and will incorrectly blame the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; Fed monetary policy &ndash; rather than the lack of any sensible regulation of credit and mortgage market lending &ndash; for creating the housing bubble and letting it fester for too long.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will also incorrectly blame the GSEs for creating &ldquo;moral hazard&rdquo; via guarantees of mortgages and thus causing this mess when, instead, the GSEs largely got out of the subprime business in the last few years - and let the free market flourish to originate this toxic waste &ndash; when politicians and policy makers started to bash the GSEs for their &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; role in the mortgage market.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Since a lot of nonsense and financially self-interested ideological spin will be written and said in the months and years to come it is important &ndash; from the beginning &ndash; to be clear about who is at fault for this utter housing and financial disaster. The answer is clear: the blame lies with free market zealot and fanatics and voodoo economics ideologues who captured US economic policy in the last six years in the same way in which a bunch of neo-cons high-jacked US foreign policy to bring &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; to the Middle East while instead leading the country into the Iraq and Mid-East quagmire and now disaster.</font></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">According to these ideologues &ndash; listen for example Larry Kudlow extolling every evening on CNBC the virtue of unregulated&nbsp;wild-west cowboy capitalism - government is always utter evil and the economy could never have a financial or economic crisis if taxes are low, government spending is minimal and government intervention and regulation of the economy and of financial systems is inexistent. This nonsense about bubbles, financial crises and recessions being impossible unless the government over-regulates the economy and/or makes monetary policy mistakes is the main religious dogma of this cabal, an axis of ideological zealotry that goes from the WSJ editorial page to a gang of voodoo economic hacks and to some segments of the financial television.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The truth is the contrary: unregulated free market capitalism that has no sensible rules, regulation and supervision and sensible countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies of financial markets leads to credit and asset bubbles, financial excesses and economic and financial crashes. Economic and financial booms and busts were much more severe in the US in the 19<sup>th</sup> when there was no central bank and no welfare state fiscal actor trying to fine tune the economic business cycle. And business cycle swings have become less frequent since Keynesian countercyclical use of monetary and fiscal policy has been introduced from the Great Depression on.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The reality of the last three US recessions &ndash; the 1990 recession, the 2001 recession and the coming 2007&nbsp;hard landing&nbsp;&ndash; is that each of these recessions started when the government stopped regulating and supervising in moderate and sensible ways financial institutions and allowed credit and financial and investment bubbles to rise and fester until they ended up in bursting bubbles and leading to recessions. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Take the latest subprime and mortgage disaster: the WSJ editorial page will certainly in due time blame the coming recession (that it now happens to predict as likely) on Congress meddling with markets on predatory lending, on excessive regulation of what financial institutions do and on the moral hazard evils of expected bailouts of mortgage lenders and borrowers. But this argument is confusing totally cause and effect. The housing and mortgage and subprime bubble and bust did not occur because of government interference and regulation of free markets. It did instead occur because government regulators were asleep at the wheel while a bunch of voodoo priests of laissez-faire capitalism were running US economic policy and let the housing and mortgage bubble fester. Blaming the now too late government crackdown on free market mortgage practices that were utterly reckless for the final bust and crash is like blaming the doctor for imposing bitter medicine to cure the disease of a <span>&nbsp;</span>reckless patient who lived in a bubble and spent the last few years on a diet of booze, drugs and artery clogging junk food. This latest mortgage carnage did not happen because of excessive over-regulation of markets by the government: it happened instead because &ndash; blinded by the anti-regulation dogmas of a bunch of priests of a voodoo religion &ndash; the government and regulators did nothing to sensibly regulate the housing and mortgage market and thus allowed this cancer to grow and fester.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Booms and busts are regular features of market economies that do not have sensible government supervision and regulation of financial and credit markets. The S&amp;L crisis that led to the credit crunch that caused the 1990 recession started when previously regulated S&amp;Ls were deregulated and there was no sensible supervision of their activities while deposit insurance led them to &ldquo;gambling for redemption&rdquo; reckless lending. And blaming<span>&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;evil&rdquo; government-provided deposit insurance for their moral hazard gambles is again confusing cause and effect: financial institution that do strictly need deposit insurance to avoid free-market capitalism liquidity and bank runs during panic episodes do require sensible government-imposed and monitored capital adequacy ratios as well as supervision and regulation of their lending activities to avoid moral hazard-induced distortions in their lending behavior. It is not government-generated moral hazard via insurance that lead to reckless gambling for redemption: it is the lack of sensible government-based regulation and supervision that leads to credit and asset bubbles. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the 1980s this deregulation of S&amp;L then led to a real estate bubble &ndash; both in commercial and residential real estate in the South of the US &ndash; that ended up in a bust once a glut of shopping strips, shopping malls, office centers, and residential homes piled up as a result of unregulated credit creation by the S&amp;L. Then, the ensuing credit crunch &ndash; rather than the necessary but late government intervention to control this free market made disaster &ndash; led to a painful recession in 1990-1991, a systemic banking crisis and a bailout of these S&amp;Ls that ended up costing the US Treasury &ndash; or better the US taxpayer &ndash; about $200 billion. Unregulated wild-west capitalism without rules and regulations was the cause of the S&amp;L boom and bust, not the eventual government intervention to deal with this mess as the priests of the free markets voodoo religion would want you to believe.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Similarly, the last six years&rsquo; housing and subprime mortgage bubble and bust had little to do with excessive government intervention &ndash; either ex-ante or ex-post. Instead they had all to do with the lack of any basic sensible government regulation of the mortgage market, regulation in practice rather than in theory. Dozens of new subprime lenders emerged and were allowed to lend via monstrous credit practices &ndash; liar or NINJA loans, no down-payment loans, interest rate only loans, negative amortization loans, teaser rates, option ARMs with no limits or controls<span>&nbsp; </span>- that should have never been allowed in the first place. Even now that regulators are starting to crack down on the most patent monstrosities such as zero down-payment and no documentation of income, jobs and assets the voodoo priests and their acolytes in the mortgage industry are starting to blame the government for interfering with free market practices: in their ideological view there were optimal reasons for all of such practices: in market fundamentalism if such practices emerged there was a good reason for them and now the government interfering with these monstrosities will cause a credit crunch that will damage the mortgage market and cause a nasty credit crunch that will lead to an economy-wide recession. What a bunch of nonsense and self-interested baloney! </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These practices instead emerged because the voodoo free market system of financial incentives for lenders &ndash;<span>&nbsp; </span>deceive borrowers with predatory practices, originate reckless mortgages to pile up fees, then securitize those mortgages and shove them on some other investors who had no clue of which toxic waste they were buying &ndash; became a whole con scheme. The way a senior and unnamed market participant put it in a bit exaggerated terms this was &ldquo;an unregulated scam where a bunch of con artists fooled a bunch of clueless deadbeat borrowers&rdquo;.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So do not blame excessive government regulation; it was the lack of any basic regulation that created the bubble. <span>&nbsp;</span>Do not blame Congress for being the cause of the coming credit crunch because of it totally appropriate predatory lending investigations and soon legislation. If such legislation will lead &ndash; as some recent analyses have suggested to the disappearance of one third of the subprime mortgage market, so be it as part of these subprime loans were deceptive, predatory and should have never been made in the first place. Lenders were systematically deceiving poor and uninformed borrowers, many of which minorities who had no clue of what they were getting into. Suppose you were a poor African American or Hispanic or a white poor with low income and no assets who wanted to pursue the American Dream of home ownership and you did not qualify for a regular mortgage because of your low income.<span>&nbsp; </span>No problem &ndash; told you the mortgage broker &ndash; we will give you a NINJA (no income, no job and assets) or liar loan, i.e. a loan with no documentation of your income and assets.<span>&nbsp; </span>You did not afford any down-payment because of little assets? No problem as we will let you to put zero down-payment so that you start with zero equity in your home. You could not afford principal payments? No problem as we will give you an interest only loan. You could not afford a fixed rate mortgage? We will give you a 2-28 ARM where the rate is fixed at low level for two years and then you move to much higher market rates. You did afford even that? We will give you a teaser rate for a little while. You could not afford even that? We will let you capitalize interest on a higher face value of the mortgage for a while so that you will have negative amortization and you pile up negative equity on your home from the very beginning.<span>&nbsp; </span>And the poor, hapless and clueless borrowers said yes to all of this as the lender never told him that after two years its debt servicing rate would balloon by 500% once he/she had to start paying high market rates and principal on an ever increasing &ndash;not decreasing &ndash; stock of mortgage debt. <span>&nbsp;</span>So do not blame Congress for necessary legislation on predatory lending for causing the current credit crunch; it was the lack of such legislation in the first place that allowed millions of mortgages that should have not been originated in the first place to mushroom without control.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Also, did the originators care or had any interest or incentive to warn the borrower that he/she could not afford such predatory and deceptive mortgages? No way as the originator would get very fat originations fees/commissions. then package this toxic waste into mortgage backed securities, get a nice rating on that garbage from oligopolistic credit rating agencies whose income derived from giving a high rating to this junk &ndash; under the pretense that tens of thousands of piles of toxic waste would turn by miracle into gourmet food &ndash; and then sell this securitized toxic junk as if it was fresh roses to even more clueless &ldquo;savvy&rdquo; investors desperately searching for yield and being dumbly ignorant of the risks that they were taking. These investors were not innocent victims; they were blinded by their own search-for-yield greed and did not bother to figure out non-transparent and totally opaque new financial instruments may be toxic waste.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then this entire housing and mortgage and securitization bubble fed an entire industry of originators, brokers, banks, broker dealers who created and securitized this junk and created CDOs, synthetic CDOs,<span>&nbsp; </span>CDOs of CDOs (CDO squared) , CDOs of CDOs of CDOs (CDOs cubed) and another totally not-transparent fog of credit derivatives &ndash; that were being priced based on intuition rather than true analysis of risk. These credit derivatives went, in less than a decade, from non-existent to a notional value of over $26 trillion. In the meanwhile this industry sold this garbage and provided financing for these investments as well as a variety of other prime broker services to a rising mountain of<span>&nbsp; </span>thousands of hedge funds. The fortunes of some of these broker dealers were partly fed for a decade from lending to home builders, to subprime originators or originating the mortgages themselves, securitizing the mortgages into RMBS, creating and managing the CDOs (and all their endless synthetic and cubed variants of them), offering aggressive prime brokerage services to the hedge funds buying this toxic waste, as well as trading on their own accounts the variety of these new instruments. No wonder these broker dealers and large financial institutions stocks are now under pressure while their arguments that they are only marginally directly exposed to subprime sound so lame: they are directly and indirectly exposed to this toxic waste via a dozen of different channels.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Also, please do not blame the GSEs (Fannie and Freddie) for this mess even if the GSE do have very different problems that need to be addressed. The GSEs were bashed for years by Greenspan, Treasury, Bernanke and a wide variety of observers for their excessive size and role in the mortgage market (securitization and guarantees of mortgages), for how they were managing their risks and for the potential moral hazard deriving from an alleged implicit bailout guarantee that allowed them to borrow at quasi-sovereign rates. Indeed some of these critiques of the GSEs do have some merit. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">But the paradoxical effect of the backlash against the GSEs has been that in the last few years these institutions have significantly reduced their role in securitizing and guaranteeing mortgages. Specifically Fannie and Fannie significantly reduced their presence in the MBS market, especially among subprime mortgages and the MBS related to them. Reacting to the persistent arguments from many fronts that the two GSEs should reduce their role in the MBS market, in the last few years the job of originating and securitizing subprime mortgages and many near-prime mortgages was mostly taken over by private sectors institutions. As the GSEs got out of this business, subprime lenders and other major financial institutions originated sub-prime and near-prime mortgages, repackaged them and securitized into MBS then sold to investors and to CDOs. So, the growth of subprime and near-prime toxic waste had little or nothing to do with the role of the GSE in the mortgage market. Fannie and Freddie may have many faults but this subprime disaster is certainly not one of them. So beware of misleading attempts to blame the GSEs and moral hazard distortions from their perceived semi-public status in contributing to this subprime and mortgage disaster. <span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The paradox is instead the fact that pulling the GSEs from any role in the subprime market allowed the &ldquo;free market&rdquo; to develop the excesses and monstrosities that the rise of subprime and near-prime mortgages generated in the last six years. It was the absence of the GSEs from this market, not their presence that contributed to this mess; and it was the presence of an unregulated free market system that allowed this monstrous bubble to be created, to be allowed to fester and to now burst with the nasty collateral damage that is coming with it. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Given the total lack of a role of the GSEs in this subprime and near-prime disaster it is really paradoxical that<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070705213834/http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2007/20070306/"> Bernanke, in his speech last week about the GSEs, pushed for reducing further their financial portfolios and recommended that the main role that they should have from now on should be the one of help support &ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo;, i.e. originating or underwriting and securitizing subprime mortgages</a>. After years of ideological battles against them and after they moved out of the subprime market, and after the unregulated free market was allowed to develop the subprime market and create the toxic disaster whose collateral damage will now be paid by the US taxpayer Bernanke is now telling us that the subprime mortgage business (&ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo;) should not be managed by the private sector but should instead be fully given to the GSEs. He formally fudged the proposal by saying that greater role of GSEs in&nbsp;affordable housing finance does not mean a greater role in the subprime&nbsp;market. But he contradicted himself: having GSEs&nbsp;having a center role in affordable housing means a central role in securitizing subprime mortgages.&nbsp;This is the same ideology that led to the subprime disaster in the first place: privatize the profits of greed and unregulated gambling for redemption; and socialize the costs and losses when disaster from free market fundamentalism occurs. This is outright corporate welfare chutzpah.</font></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Also, it is now clear that making subprime loans is clearly not an economically rational business for the private sector given the current subprime disaster. However whether Fannie and Freddie should do it instead&nbsp;or not is not obvious. If there is a role for the government in this markt&nbsp;then one may want to tax those who can afford to finance the subsidies for affordable housing. So Bernanke wants to reduce the GSE&#39;s interference with free markets by giving them and the public sector a greater role in affordable housing. But if the GSE have to do - and be perceived as doing -&nbsp;business as private sector firms that do not benefit from moral hazard related government&nbsp;how can they subsidize affordable housing and make a profit? If they get a role in affordable housing effectively Bernanke is telling us that they are public institutions, not private ones. So implicitly Bernanke is undermining all his&nbsp;attempts and those of others to make the GSEs truly private institutions that are not perceived as being protected by a Treasury bailout guarantee.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The same free market fundamentalist zealots &ndash; at the WSJ editorial page, among voodoo economics hacks and among the policy makers that mis-managed US economic policy for the last few years &ndash; who bashed the GSEs were also pushing the other mantra of the benefits for growth of low taxation of capital. But take housing. The taxation of investment in housing &ndash; an effectively unproductive form of capital - not only is not heavy; it is rather tax-preferred relative to other productive forms of capital. The zealots who want low taxation of capital got it all in the tax-favorite status of housing investment by households. The result has been another monstrosity: a decade of massive overinvestment by the US in one of the most unproductive forms of capital, housing. This overinvestment fed by low taxation of housing investment has led to large current account deficits - via the increase in housing investment and the fall in private savings that the housing wealth effect had on consumption - and to the accumulation of trillions of foreign liabilities. So instead on increasing its stock of productive physical capital the US has spent a decade piling up trillions <span>&nbsp;</span>of dollars of investment in unproductive housing capital that has no effects on the rate of productivity of the economy. The rest of the world spent the last decade investing in factories that produce world class, high-quality and low costs goods; the US invested in McMansions that have zero productivity value and spillovers for the economy. Again thank the free market fundamentalist zealots who love no regulation and little taxation of capital for this sorry state.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The same free market zealots have now started to blame the Fed for causing the housing bubble. In their view the Fed, by aggressively easing rates after 2001 and keeping the Fed Funds rates too low for too long, created the housing bubble that is now bursting. So they blame the Fed for a disaster that had its source in the private sector behavior and actions. The same free marketers argue that the Fed created the tech bubble that burst in 2000 and led to the 2001 recession. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But while easy Fed policy had some role in the three private sector bubbles of the last two decades that ended up in a recession bust -<span>&nbsp; </span>late 1980s real estate bubble that led to S&amp;L bust and 1990s recession, the late 1990s tech bubble that led to the 2000 tech bust and the 2001 recession, <span>&nbsp;</span>the 2000s housing bubble that led to the housing bust of 2006 and the coming recession of 2007 &ndash; the center of the problem<span>&nbsp; </span>in each one of these three booms and busts was not &ndash; as voodoo religion hacks and zealots spin it now - excessively easy monetary policy by the Fed but rather proper regulation of financial and credit markets. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The center cause of these disasters was the lack of appropriate regulation of free markets. First, in the 1980s S&amp;L were deregulated and wild-west capitalism became the norm of the credit policies of the S&amp;Ls in the South and South-West of the US: then, a bunch of greedy cowboys and at time criminal con artists high-jacked the credit policies of the S&amp;Ls and triggered a private sector real estate boom that, like today, created a massive amount of <span>&nbsp;</span>toxic waste in real estate. This toxic garbage then exploded in the late 1980s in a nasty bust that triggered a credit crunch that was the main cause of the 1990-91 recession. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Second, in the 1990s, the attempt to avoid the liquidity run and crunch caused by another unregulated private sector-related reckless leverage &ndash; the near collapse of LTCM and its collateral damage &ndash; induced the Fed to ease the Fed Funds rate by 75bps in the fall of 1998 and let the tech sector &ldquo;irrational exuberance&rdquo; - that Greenspan had already identified in 1996 - to fester even longer. But higher Fed Funds rates would have not stopped this private sector crazed mania. What was necessary then was again better regulation of the financial system: much tighter margin requirements on leveraged stock market investments; control of leverage in the financial system and among highly leveraged institutions such as hedge funds. Failure to implement sensible regulation &ndash; such as margin requirements on leveraged tech investments - allowed the tech bubble to fester, then go bust in 2000-2001 and cause a painful recession in 2001 . </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Third, this time around it is not true &ndash; like the WSJ editorial page has repeatedly and wrongly argued &ndash; that the housing bubble was mostly caused by a Fed that kept the Fed Funds rate too low for too long. Higher interest rates sooner would have made only little difference, especially in a world where long rates and mortgage rates depended more on global factors - that kept such rates low - rather than on monetary policy. The central Fed failure was not that of keeping the Fed Funds rate too low for too long (that was only a modest misdemeanor) <span>&nbsp;</span>but rather its failure (as well as that of other banking regulators) to control the credit bubble in the housing market via appropriate supervision and regulation of mortgage finance and via prevention of monster lending practices. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Greenspan allowed the tech bubble to fester by first warning about irrational exuberance and then doing nothing about via either monetary policy or, better, proper regulation of the financial system while at the same time becoming the &ldquo;cheerleader of the new economy&rdquo;. And Greenspan/Bernanke allowed the housing bubble to develop in three ways of increasing importance: first, easy Fed Funds policy (but this was a minor role); second, being asleep at the wheel (together with all the banking regulators) in regulating housing lending; third, by becoming the cheerleaders of the monstrosities that were going under the name of &ldquo;financial innovations&rdquo; of housing finance. Specifically, Greenspan explicitly supported in public speeches the development and growth of the risky option ARMs and other exotic mortgage innovations that allowed the subprime and near-prime toxic waste to mushroom. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In a world where the leading ideology was to reduce regulation to a minimum, not only closing one&rsquo;s eyes on monster lending practices but rather actively praising them as brilliant financial innovations, bashing GSEs in the name of letting the superior private sector to take a bigger role in monster housing finance, it is not a surprise that the biggest bubble in U.S. history was created, incentivated and allowed to fester until it imploded. Free market fundamentalist zealotry that did not understand that market capitalism needs some basic and sensible rules, regulation and supervision to control excesses, bubbles, greed and investors&rsquo; manias and panics. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The political neo-con freedom and liberty fundamentalists deluded themselves that free elections and military invasions will automatically lead to democracy in the Middle East. Instead, their free elections and freedom-agenda ended up getting Hamas, Hizbollah and Shite fanatics to come to power in Gaza, Lebanon and Iraq and while destabilizing Iraq and soon a good chunk of Middle-East. In the same way the free market fundamentalism zealots deluded themselves that unregulated free markets and low taxes could never do anything wrong or harm. Too bad that unregulated free markets that systematically lead &ndash; as two hundred years of US economic history show - to bubbles that end up in busts and nasty recessions have been the source of the last two US recessions. The implementation of this ideology is also the source of the latest housing boom and bust that is already leading to a severe credit crunch in the mortgage market and that will lead to an economy-wide recession in 2007 that will be deeper and more painful than those in 1990 and 2001.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So it was a vast range of dogmas and free market fundamentalism pushed by a bunch of ideological zealots - that were handmaiden to financial interests that enjoy private profits in good times and corporate welfare paid by the US taxpayer when their free market greed and excesses lead to nasty financial busts - that created this disaster. It was not an evil, large and over-regulating government that created this disaster. It was instead an ideology and practice of unregulated free markets that fed this mess.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now that the mess has occurred and the financial costs of widespread bankruptcies among borrowers and lenders will be severe the issue will be the one of how to clean up this mess by helping the true victims while not bailing out the true culprits.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The main challenge will be to help the victims of this disaster &ndash; those households that were duped into predatory mortgages and who are now unable to service their resetting ARMs &ndash; without bailing out the private &ldquo;free market&rdquo; institutions that created this mess in the first place. Market capitalism works if equity holders first and bondholders second take the losses of their own investment mistakes. So wide-scale public bail-out of financial institutions should be strictly avoided and minimized. The trouble is that when deposit-taking institutions fail because their net worth is negative (as a consequence of bad lending) deposit insurance limits the losses that can be inflicted on these effectively senior creditors of these banks. Thus first losses should be taken by shareholders and other unsecured bondholders and creditors of the banks. In the case of the subprime lenders until now the failures have been concentrated among institutions that relied on capital markets for funding, rather than on insured bank deposits. Thus losses can and should be allocated to owners and bondholders of these institutions with no use of public money to bailout anyone. However, we cannot exclude that in due time some commercial banks and other deposit-taking institutions will get into trouble and public money may be needed to clean up the balance sheets of such institutions. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Public funds to help borrowers should be used with care for several reasons. First, some forms of borrowers&rsquo; financial support end up bailing out also the culprits of this mess; thus, these specific forms of support of homeowners under financial distress should be avoided. For example, direct subsidies to households who cannot afford their now-reset and excessively high mortgage payments end up helping the victims as well as the culprits. Thus, this kind of support should be avoided. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Second, across the board support of all sub-prime borrowers would be inappropriate: while many borrowers were duped into predatory mortgages by lenders who did not explain to them what were the true terms of these loans, a minority of borrowers recklessly borrowed well knowing they could not afford the terms of the mortgage. They borrowed either gambling into capital gains that never occurred (speculative investment in homes) or planning strategic early default on their mortgage. The latter phenomenon is represented by the epidemic of early payments defaults that we have seem among some subprime mortgages: given the time that it takes to foreclose a home some borrowers intentionally took mortgages that they were not planning to service at all to enjoy the benefits of a few months of free rent of a home. However, these few deadbeat borrowers were able to dupe lenders because underwriting standards of originators were recklessly loose to begin with: anyone lying about their income, job and asset could get a mortgage.</font></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; </font></span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The analysis above suggests some principles for the coming financial support that will be given with public funds to clean up the unfolding mortgage disaster. First, distinguish between true victims of predatory lending and deadbeat borrowers who were into early strategic default. Early payments default is a clear way to distinguish between inability to pay and unwillingness to pay. Also, means testing for financial support is crucial: low income and low asset households who were pursuing the American Dream and were deceived by lenders may deserve support. But subprime borrowers with higher incomes and/or assets do not deserve support and should be pushed into foreclosure if they are unable or unwilling to service their mortgages. Also, condo-flippers and other&nbsp;individuals who bought homes for speculative purposes such as speculating&nbsp;on price increases&nbsp;(i.e. folks who were&nbsp;not&nbsp;first time homeowners&nbsp;who lived&nbsp;in their homes) would get no financial&nbsp;relief at all&nbsp;and will be forced to foreclose if they are unable or unwilling to service their mortgage. &nbsp;Second, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070705213834/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apmL.3w.r52c">financial support to households who were victims of predatory lending (and owners of overvalued homes whose value was incorrectly assessed as much higher than equilibrium) should take the form of reduced debt servicing (as in some recent proposals)&nbsp;rather than subsidies to borrowers; this to prevent the support of the borrowing victims from indirectly bailing out the culprits of reckless or predatory lending</a>. </font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">For example, suppose that the value of a home (with zero down-payment) has fallen 10% (following the current housing bust) and that the borrower cannot now pay the full value of the mortgage debt servicing payments that are now being reset at much higher interest rates. Then, if the borrower can afford a lower string of service payments<span>&nbsp; </span>that, in NPV terms, is 10% lower than the initial terms of the mortgage (and equal to the true value of the home), the solution will be to allow a reduction of 10% (in NPV terms) of the debt-servicing payments for the borrower. Instead, a public subsidy to the borrower in the same amount would have the same effect on the borrower while bailing out a reckless or predatory lender.<span>&nbsp; </span></font></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Suppose instead that the home value has fallen 10% but the household cannot afford even a 10% NPV reduction of the stream of debt payments associated with the initial mortgage (say at zero initial down-payment). Then, the household &ndash; duped or not &ndash; was buying a home with a bundle of housing services that was too large relative to its ability to afford it even after the value of the mortgage has been adjusted to the lower market value of the home. In this case if it takes more than a 10% reduction in the NPV of the debt payments to allow the household to be able (or equivalently willing) to afford the home. Thus, it make sense to foreclose the home and not provide financial support to the household: duped or not the household had bought a home whose real housing services were too large relative to even its ability to afford it at a reduced market value. Thus, financial support of the household is not warranted and foreclosure is a socially efficient solution. The bank should take the loss of a mortgage with a home value lower than the mortgage. And such household should rent a lower amount of housing services by renting a smaller home/apartment rather than own a home with a bundle of housing services that it cannot afford.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Finally, if deposit-taking institutions whose depositors benefit of deposit insurance go bankrupt (have negative net worth) because of housing related losses, equity holders should be wiped out first and unsecured bondholders should suffer next before any public funds are used to recapitalize and fiscalize the losses of the bank. This simple principle would minimize the fiscal costs of cleaning up distressed banks while minimizing the moral hazard distortions of deposit insurance.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In summary, lack of sensible supervision and regulation of banks, mortgage lenders and other financial institution &ndash; partly induced by an ideology of free market fundamentalism &ndash; has been the core cause of this private sector created disaster, not excesses of regulation or of government policy. Thus, to minimize the fiscal costs of cleaning up this mess, use of public funds should be carefully managed and targeted to help the true victims of this mess &ndash; borrowers duped by predatory lending practices &ndash; while avoiding any bail-out of the culprits of this mess. Privatizing profits in good times while socializing losses in bad times is another form of reckless corporate welfare that generates moral hazard while fostering new bubbles.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ideological supply side&nbsp;voodoo&nbsp;zealots should not be allowed to spin a tale where evil government intervention caused this disaster. And the private sector institutions and investors that indulged in this unregulated reckless behavior should take their losses. Market economies are the best economic system but they work properly when private greed, manias, panics, stupidity and recklessness is tempered by sensible supervision and regulation. And may the unfolding mortgage disaster bury once and for all the neo-con supply side voodoo economics&nbsp;religion of unregulated free markets fundamentalism.</font></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>	<div style="margin:10px;border:1px solid red; padding-top:10px;text-align:center; color:red;font-weight:bold;">

In this instance, "Trust" does not refer to monopolistic operations a la Standard Oil, but the following: a "Trust" would be formed to purchase listed shares in holding companies of dubious assets, sometimes on margin.

The government needs to provide at-risk homeowners ``forbearance or something like that to give them a chance to work through and get a new financial instrument here that they can manage financially better,'' Dodd said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Delinquencies among subprime mortgage borrowers hit a four- year high in the fourth quarter, the Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association said today. The trade group said 13.33 percent of subprime borrowers were behind on payments in the quarter, the highest rate since the third quarter of 2002. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>More than two dozen mortgage lenders have gone bankrupt, closed operations or sought buyers since the beginning of last year as the effect of looser lending standards, slowing home- price gains, and less wage growth left banks holding bad loans. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Looking to Help &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Congress ``may need to do something much more quickly to provide some protection or you could end up with a lot of poverty and blight,'' Dodd said. Federal aid of a few billion dollars ``may be a lot less costly'' than $164 billion in lost wealth, he said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Mortgage defaults during the next two years may rise to $225 billion, with about $170 billion tied to subprime loans, according to a report yesterday by analyst at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. led by Srinivas Modukuri. Subprime borrowers are those with poor or limited credit backgrounds or high debt. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Dodd didn't specify the channel through which federal aid would be offered. ``I don't want to settle on the specifics of it, but clearly we are looking at what we can do to help out.'' &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Any formal legislation would have to be approved by Dodd's committee, then passed by both the full Senate and the House of Representatives before being signed into law by the president. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Costly Solution &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Federal aid ``would come at a cost,'' said Douglas Duncan, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. ``It has to be paid for and the question is would the 34 percent of homeowners who have no mortgage be willing to pay taxes to support the bailout of people who traditionally have not managed credit well?'' &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Duncan expressed doubt that 2.2 million subprime mortgage borrowers will lose their homes, noting that the association lists only 300,000 such borrowers as being in foreclosure now. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Senator Richard Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democratic leader, said he is open to the idea of helping subprime borrowers while noting that Democratic leaders haven't decided whether to do so. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>``We have not discussed it, but that doesn't mean that we can't or shouldn't,'' Durbin said in an interview. ``Senator Dodd is in a key position on the Banking Committee and he's talked to us about the scope of this problem and what the reasonable response might be. I'm sensitive to it. There's nothing worse than a person losing their home.'' &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Durbin said that Democratic leaders will look to Dodd for recommendations as Dodd's committee examines the issue. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>New Bill &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, reiterated today that he intends to introduce a bill to deter lenders from offering consumers mortgages they can't afford. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>``We plan to legislate to restrict those kinds of mortgages going forward,'' Frank said after a hearing in Washington. He declined to elaborate on the timing or details of such legislation. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Dodd reaffirmed a plan to introduce a bill that would combat predatory lending. ``There is a difference between a subprime lender and a predator, and I don't want to lose the subprime lender,'' he said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and other U.S. regulators on March 2 directed banks to scrutinize underwriting standards, provide more information to customers about borrowing risks and ensure borrowers are able to repay loans. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>``Finally the federal regulators are beginning to indicate that they want to start requiring similar standards to be used for prime and subprime lending,'' Dodd said, referring to the new guidelines. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>``I am a strong advocate of subprime lending,'' Dodd said. ``I don't want that word to become a pejorative as junk bonds did.'' &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>While not constituting a drag on the economy, defaults may increase to $300 billion if home prices fall and borrowers forgo refinancing because of stricter lending standards, Lehman said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

The changes would help the agency develop new mortgage products and serve a larger number of borrowers, Clinton said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Turmoil in the subprime mortgage market is grabbing the attention of Congress, regulators and consumer groups in the face of a surge in delinquencies and foreclosures. Late payments on U.S. subprime loans reached a four-year high of 13.3 percent in the fourth quarter, while foreclosures on all home loans reached record levels, the Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association announced this week. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>``The market will not address the millions of families trapped in unworkable mortgages hounded by delinquency and facing the grim possibility of foreclosure,'' Clinton said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Pre-Payment Penalties &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Clinton proposed eliminating pre-payment penalties that she said are ``designed to trap borrowers'' by imposing high fees for paying off loans ahead of time. Such penalties apply to 70 percent of subprime loans and less than 5 percent of prime loans, she said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Lenders should give borrowers who fall behind on their mortgages a ``foreclosure timeout'' to allow them time develop a payment plan, Clinton said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>She also called for independent counseling to help borrowers avoid becoming saddled with high interest rates and penalties. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The FHA has proposed its own legislative changes to give the agency additional authority. Steve O'Halloran, a spokesman for the agency, welcomed Clinton's proposals in an e-mailed statement. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>John Taylor, the president of the Washington-based coalition sponsoring the conference, blamed the Federal Reserve for the problems faced by subprime borrowers. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Consumers Not Protected &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The central bank had the regulatory authority to protect consumers and go after lenders using deceptive practices ``and simply has chosen not to do it,'' he said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Fed spokeswoman Susan Stawick declined to comment. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Taylor called for legislation that improves loan underwriting standards and curbs ``unsustainable loans.'' &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>``Once and for all, we need to have legislation that will not allow anybody in the lending industry to be able to push a loan toward a person that any reasonable person would agree they should not have gotten,'' Taylor said. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>A House subcommittee is scheduled to hold a hearing on predatory lending in the subprime market on March 27. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

At the present time, Fannie and Freddie&nbsp;<br/>appear to fail this test. Indeed, by OFHEO's estimation, less than 30 percent of the GSEs' current portfolio holdings are oriented toward affordable housing (Lockhart, 2007).&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>"A straightforward means of anchoring the GSE portfolios to a clear public mission would be to require Fannie and Freddie to focus their&nbsp;<br/>portfolios almost exclusively on holdings of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities that support affordable housing.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>"... Given the size and depth of the secondary market for most residential mortgages, the GSEs' purchase and retention of highly rated mortgages and of their own MBS are unlikely to do much to enhance liquidity in the secondary markets for these assets or to promote&nbsp;<br/>affordable housing.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>"... the market for affordable-housing products--particularly mortgages extended to households with below-median-income--is less deep and liquid&nbsp;<br/>than the broader market for residential mortgages. GSE portfolio purchases might add significant liquidity to the secondary markets for such assets, thereby reducing costs and increasing credit availability&nbsp;<br/>to prospective home purchasers. In addition, increasing the presence of the GSEs in the market for affordable housing could help banks fulfill their CRA obligations by providing them with greater opportunities for securitizing such loans. In all, from a social perspective, focusing the GSE portfolios on affordable housing could provide benefits that might&nbsp;<br/>offset some of the risks that these more-targeted portfolios might pose to financial markets and to taxpayers. The key principle here is that the GSEs' senior debt--which investors view as government-backed--should be used only to finance assets (such as affordable-housing mortgages) that have, in the view of the Congress, a clear and measurable public&nbsp;<br/>benefit.16 Such an approach would set some functional limits on the size of the portfolios and on the range of assets that GSEs would be allowed to purchase, while preserving the ability of these companies to operate profitably."&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>"To be clear, I am not advocating a change in the exposure of GSEs to subprime loans.17 Orienting the GSEs' portfolios more toward affordable housing is an approach which can succeed under the current GSE credit&nbsp;<br/>standards. Indeed, the credit risks associated with an&nbsp;<br/>affordable-housing portfolio need not be any greater than mortgage portfolios generally, so long as the GSEs continue to adhere to sound underwriting practices. Moreover, a renewal of the GSE affordable-housing mission might stimulate the development of innovative approaches to measuring and managing the credit risks associated with such mortgages."&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070705213834/http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2007/20070306/" target="_blank">http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2007/20070306/</a>&nbsp;<br/>

The Govt's efforts to do so, waged over the past 5+ years, have largely failed.  Bernanke appears to have devised a politically attractive way to re-direct the GSE's so as to shrink their role:&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>1.  Reduce their profitability (offset current income with loan losses).&nbsp;<br/>2.  Reduce their leverage (because of the danger of large losses).&nbsp;<br/>3.  Increase their "social utility" to the public by giving them a role in the subprime/affordable housing space.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The political appeal of supporting homeownership for low income families might suffice to defeat the massive political strength of the housing industry.  Note that the banks will want to help eliminate this powerful competitor.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

As soon as the Federal Reserve loosened its shackles, the economy promptly took off again, propelled by pent-up demand. For the first time in history, the U.S. economy went into recession against the backdrop of most rampant money and credit growth. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Manifestly, the forces depressing the economy this time are radically different from past experience. The typical, major imbalance in post-war business cycles has usually been in inventories. To correct it, retailers and manufacturers temporarily sold from stock, depressing production. Once the stocks were down to desired levels, production came into its right again. At the heart of the regular V-shaped business cycles was the inventory cycle. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>In contrast, the present downturn has its brunt in the combination of a profit and capital-spending crisis. At the same time, there has accumulated an array of economic and financial dislocations that tend to depress the economy in many ways, such as extremely poor profits, badly ravaged balance sheets, a variety of asset bubbles in different stages of development, excessive leverage in the whole financial system and shrinking cash flow. There is nothing normal anymore in the U.S. economy and its financial system.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>For the old economists, investment in tangible assets — factories, commercial buildings and machinery — was paramount in creating both economic growth and wealth. It creates demand, employment and income as the capital goods are produced. And with their installment, all these new buildings, plant and equipment create increased supply along with increasing employment and income with increased productivity.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The United States has always been a low-savings and low-investment economy. Putting it in reverse: a high-consumption economy. But all three went to unprecedented extremes over the past several years. Savings and investment have been run down to atrociously low levels that are typical for underdeveloped countries.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>To repeat: Investment in tangible assets is paramount in creating everything that is decisive in generating our wealth and raising our living standards. Given the low levels of saving and investment in the United States, American policymakers and economists in recent years have elevated productivity growth to the single most important achievement of an economy. But just by itself, productivity growth creates only unemployment. It is the normally associated capital spending that makes for the necessary, simultaneous demand and employment growth. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>This simple recognition — gross lack of saving and capital formation — is really at the root of our controversial and highly critical view of the U.S. economy’s sanity and vitality. True, its growth rate has been the highest among the industrial countries for years. But it has all the time been economic growth of the most miserable quality. The striking hallmarks of this extremely poor quality were collapsing savings, low rates of business fixed investment, a profit carnage that began at the height of the boom, exploding consumer and business debts and an exploding trade deficit.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Today’s economists have at their disposal information in quantity and speed as never before. But reading numerous reports, we have the impression that very few are making use of it. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Particularly shocking in this respect were the immediate euphoric reports about growth acceleration in the second quarter.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>During the 1960–70s, by the way, the U.S. accumulated on average about 1.5 dollars of additional debt for each dollar of additional GDP. Just extrapolate this escalating relationship between the use of debt and economic activity. And think of it: the GDP growth of today is tomorrow a thing of the past, while the debts incurred remain. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Plainly, Greenspan’s policy has collapsed into uncontrolled money and debt creation that has rapidly diminishing returns on economic activity. The late economist Hyman P. Mynsky would call this a Ponzi economy, where debt payments on outstanding and soaring indebtedness are no longer met out of current income, but through new borrowing. Soaring unpaid interests become capitalized. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>P.S. We keep asking the question of the American economists: Are they providing deliberate misinformation or simply performing slipshod work? In our view, as usual, the latter rings true. &nbsp;<br/>

To put this as frankly as possible, this is just nonsense.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Even if subprime delinquencies and defaults are up, they're a tiny portion of total mortgages. Suppose 13 percent of subprime mortgages are in default. Subprime itself is less than 15 percent of total mortgage debt, so that means that roughly 2 percent of mortgage debt is delinquent or in default.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Yes, that's more than it used to be, and is a disaster for the subprime mortgage companies.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>But when a mortgage defaults, the lender takes back the house or condo, sells it, and usually recovers about 75 percent of the loan value or more. That means the real loss would be about 25 percent of 2 percent, or 1/2 of 1 percent.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>In the context of a market as huge as the nation's mortgage market, that's not a lot. A few companies will go bankrupt, and someone will make a killing buying their bonds and portfolios at a huge discount as they turn out to be worth a lot more than people thought in March 2007. But it won't mean a lot to a roughly $14 trillion economy, of which the subprime mortgage market is a tiny blip.&nbsp;<br/>

Why should government bail out those speculators who bought those exotic securitized instruments?  And just how does the government effectively differentiate between borrowers who were genuinely duped and speculators who should be responsible for their reckless actions?  And is it fair to tax-payers who did not benefit at all from this subprime bubble?  It just seems morally worng that speculators who got us into this mess in the first place wind up getting bailed out by government.  That is incentive for further abuse -- just make sure the abuse is big enough to take the entire system hostage so government will bail them out again.

Freeze trading in the old CDO's: whoever has them, has them to maturity, except that another institution can buy them (at the lower price) if it agrees to assume recourse AND provide the same discount to the original mortgage's principal amount, resulting in lower homeowner payments.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

In the old days when banks and credit unions keep the underlying mortgages on their own book, they can work with borrowers to restructure the loan and that would also make it easier to manage government assistance.  But now with securitization, banks have already sold the loans and mortgages are handled by a servicing company who has no incentive to spend the time  and efforts to restructure these debts.  So the issue is the abuse in the system when large sum of government money is involved.  There are no easy answers.&nbsp;<br/>CMC

However, free markets do not mean unregulated markets. At least where I come from, banks and other financial institutions are not allowed to sell a mortgage without a 20% down payment and strict rules to verify the borrower's income and assets. And that is a very sensible thing since it prevents, to a great extent, losses for banks and financial institutions as well as defaults from borrowers, and keeps the finance sector well oiled. Mortgage buyers can also request a consumer credit loan to pay their down payment. But this is subject to interest rates similar to credit card rates (very high) and are short term loans. And the bank has to verify net assets and income again before being authorized to give the loan. I think this is a reasonable regulation, helping both lenders (by trying to make sure they'll get their money back) and borrowers (by making sure they're able to repay the loan). I frankly never understood how regulators allowed such lax lending practices in the US. I believe the system I just described is a reasonable system to be put in practice. This does not mean that bad loans won't happen. But they are contained in a reasonable range.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Ernst

This process began with the Depository Institutions Deregulatory and Monetary Control Act of 1980.  They have benefited greatly, and will now probably escape with a bailout.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>For the legal options of borrowers, I direct you to section 608 of the Depository Institutions Deregulatory and Monetary Control Act and Section 108 of the Truth in Lending Act.

It is pathetic that mainstream media keeps driving with blinders on: the recent BusinessWeek touts how families are taking advantage of 30 year fixed which are going lower...

It is a bunch of hogwash, because  the valley never really recovered from the tech winter of 2001/2002, real unemployment is more like 15% to 20% (if one includes wives who are looking but can't find jobs) and double-income families are rare here, which a family needs to afford the $700,000 home (median-price in SFO Bay Area). I did some preliminary analysis and am recommending that people rent and not buy, since renting is half of mortgage. My complete article on the Bay Area housing (more to come in the next few weeks) can be found below, for those interested in California real-estate (I also am urging my readers to read your blog, as one of my recommendations....)&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070705213834/http://economy.franteractive.com/real-estate/bay-area1.html" target="_blank">http://economy.franteractive.com/real-estate/bay-area1.html</a>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Best regards,&nbsp;<br/>Sam

Greenspan and co. dropping the FF rate to one measly percentage point, and implicitly condoning the development of the bubble by denying that it even existed, while lauding the risky lending practices that developed in its wake. &nbsp;<br/>meanhile, when Mr. Bernanke asserts that the GSEs are NOT deemed 'too big to fail' the whole world has a good belly-laugh; everybody knows they will be bailed out - it's an absolute certainty, more certain than  gravity. &nbsp;<br/>this allows them to indulge in risks no rational economic agent in a truly free market would likely ever take on. &nbsp;<br/>so please, let's for a change not blame the  'free markets' , but instead put blame where it belongs, with interventionist monetary and fiscal policy. &nbsp;<br/>in this context note that the very foundation of the financial system - the currency system itself - is NOT a free market. if it were, there would not be a 'central bank', and there would not be any 'fiat money' either. these are features of central economic planning, which of course doesn't work (never has, never will). &nbsp;<br/>why people would believe - and by and large unthinkingly accept - that money should be excepted from the rules of the market is a bit of a mystery, but no discussion of a financial boom/bust situation such as this one makes sense without considering this central root cause of booms and busts.

I think we must ask just what would a "bailout" distressed homeowners accomplish, and whom would it really help? The chances are good that many of the distrssed homeowners have little equity in their homes, and some of those that do only have it by virtue of its appreciation during the bubble phase. Other distressed homeowners have sucked the equity out and transformed it into current consumption. For many of these of these situations, the real loss would be the idea of home ownership as opposed to a loss of material net worth. If these homes were foreclosed, there would be a greater demand for rentals. It appears to me that the real beneficiaries of any kind of bailout, or government intervention would be the insitutional beneficiaries who have already profited so handsomely during the inflation of the real estate bubble. There has been ample discussion in this blog of the potential adverse systemwide financial effects of this sub-prime/alt-a meltdown. When the demogogic rhetoric is pierced, it is these institutions that will be given forebearance. If a sub-prime mortgagee is currently in trouble, why would they be less in trouble in the future? Better job, better consumption and credit management, lower health care costs? I don't think so.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>As to who is to blame, in a complex socio-economic system such as ours there is such implicit and explicit complicity that there is usually enoough blame to go around. The question of free market idealogues or a more regulated environment serves to more polarize positions. In reality free markets are more of a hypothetcial construct than anything which exists in reality. By the same token&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>"Booms and busts are regular features of market economies that do not have sensible government supervision and regulation of financial and credit markets." leaves open the question as to what is sensible, and even if sensible in conception, does the corruptable human element of implementation hold within it the seed of its own demise? There does not appear to be a party monopoly on malfeasance and less than ethical behavior. Both the democrats and republicans seem to have ample skill in this regard.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The real question crux of the matter seems to come down to human behavior and character.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Ryan Darwish&nbsp;<br/>www.investmentmegatends.com&nbsp;<br/>Author of The Emperor's Clothes: A Look at the Megatrends Affecting Your Financial and Investment Decisions

I spent endless ink in this blog explaining why low Fed Funds rate were not the main source of the housing bubble and why the GSEs - who may be blamed for a lot - were not at the center of the subprime securitization as they left that business to free private markets for the last few years. And i explained in detail how supporters of true victims (not all borrowers) can be provided without bailing out reckless lenders. So you make the usual fundamentalist arguments blaming government policies for this mess without bringing a shred of analysis and evidence for it. Try harder next time around.&nbsp;<br/> 
<br/><div class="commentcredit">Written by Nouriel on 2007-03-19 13:44:32</div></div><a name="akocomment44728"></a> <div class="commentbox">Pater Tenebrarum &nbsp;<br/>As I mentioned before, I believe that the cause of all this is that the financial markets lack reasonable regulations. The main one in this case is that lenders should verify if their borrowers will be able to repay. And there are many ways to regulate this without becoming a serious impediment to a free market. The Central Bank uses interest rates to smoothen the extremes of a cyclical market. Or that's what it should do. Obviously lenders did not put a gun to the head on borrowers. Borrowers were either stupid or malicious. There always will be bad loans since checking that borrowers are able to repay does not mean they are willing to repay. There is a certain percentage of crooks in every society. And banks and businesses know roughly that percentage amount and annualy or quarterly make a provision for uncollectible receivables against profits. &nbsp;<br/>But the Fed rates have nothing to do with people being forced to enter unpayable debts. Interest rates normally rise and fall in the US. They may not be so variable in Switzerland, but they are in the US. So US consumers are perfectly aware of this fact since they have been experiencing this for tens of years in their credit cards. So don't, please, put so much blame on the Fed. Why the heck would a sane person enter a contract he will not be able to repay instead of renting a home, which he can afford? I am at a loss to understand. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Ernst

Had the market gone the other way and produced 30%/ 40% gains over the next year or so would anyone be suggesting that those priced out of the mkt in that case should have a large subsidy to make up for the fact that they didn't buy earlier?  Of course not.  If the government bails people out of this mess then that is a green light that propoerty investment and speculation has little downside and the bubble will become scarily large.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I do think that in the relatively small number of cases where it can be shown that products were so mis-sold it's obvious that they shouldn't have some redress should be considered.  I strongly feel though that this should be the responsibilty of the finance companies and their parents who made these loans and profited hfrom the repackaging and reselling.  It should not be down to the general taxpayer who was not complicit in this arrangement.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Overall I believe that we are all responsible for our actions and the conequences of them and do not believe that being bailed out by an already bankrupt taxpayer is relevant.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Ibid I think that this was an unfair comment to Brian.  It was indeed greed for money which has put people in stretched situations that have caused problems, either their own or the greed of the industry that sold to them.  My understanding is that this risk taking is part of the american way, and if people guess correctly they do well, if not they don't.  It's not appropriate to have a one sided subsidy, nor in my opinion to change the rules once the game has started.  Holistically I agree with your comment, but the way in which we live and in which our society operates is so far from the way in which it should that it is a different debate and not one for an economic blog I feel.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

Perhaps there is some disagreement on the appropriate prison terms or method of execution.  But if you are under the impression that anyone who is a "libertarian" must believe Milton Friedman made useful contributions to economics, it is not difficult to disabuse yourself.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>It is certainly an error to assume that refuting the latter, which is easy, refutes the former.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The proposition that inadequate regulation can be responsible for financial disasters is not at all inconsistent with Austrian "praxeology."  In fact, Austrians will tell you that this is exactly how intrinsically unstable systems which include a regulatory central point of failure fail.  The political power of the regulator is overcome by corrupt interests - precisely as you document.  The obvious near-term solution is making the regulator bigger and stronger.  In the short term this works.  In the long term it provides more points of access by which corrupt interests can capture the system.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Austrians think the world works better without bandaids, but that doesn't mean that if you have a spouting artery you shouldn't throw some duct tape on it.  It means that a financial system should be designed in such a way that it does not end up as a giant sphere of incrementally applied adhesives with a continually spreading pool of blood at the bottom.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Yet I can think of no better way to describe the place to which the indefinitely sustainable tension of Keynesian mandarin dirigisme and Friedmanite mathemolatrous "free-market dogmatism" has brought us.  If the history of the last 50 years has taught us anything, it is that neither of these forces can inflict a final defeat on the other.  This does not prove that both are pseudosciences, but it hardly contradicts the hypothesis.

But, it makes a great deal of sense.  I drive through all the new subdivisions currently destroying agricultural land in my area and it amazes me that none of the capital or credit used in their construction is being put to productive use.  I am glad to see that I have some support in this belief.  I think that much error is generated by thinking that people make rational choices in things like house purchases.  I have been attempting to sell a small split level house in a small town with some severe economic challenges.  I had a person try for 5 months to buy it last year who was handicapped and who could not navigate the stairs nor use the upstairs bathroom.  She was strung along by a variety of mortgage scam artists for 5 months.  Her only documented income was Socialist Security Disability, and was being paid in cash for some sort of a job.  Her reported income was far too low to support the mortgage payments for even a cheap house like mine.  There was no way that she should even have been considered for a mortgage.  She could not even afford a down payment.  But, she was told that if she had only applied for a certain mortgage before December 15, 2006 she would have qualified for a mortgage!  So, here was a person seeking to buy a house that was totally ill suited for her needs, with no money, and not enough income to support the deal.  And, was planning on doing extensive renovations to boot.  Not much rationality involved there.  My realtor went to a  continuing education course and they spent an afternoon on mortgage fraud.  Virtually all of what they covered had happened during this abortive process.  If this sort of sad case is common, and it sure seems that it is, then Professor Roubini's stark predictions are probably even a bit optimistic.  There is a need for some sort of sub prime market for people starting out.  But first time buyers are not the only ones to inflate assets and income to buy more house than they can really afford.  I suspect that fraud is equally present in the more expensive mortgage realms as well.  The difficulty lies in coming up with some ways of fixing what can be fixed in this disaster, without subsidizing moral hazard or fraud.

If there is any borrower who can offer better interest rates than the slightly negative performance of simple storage, lending will occur.  Lenders, in other words, are comparing apples to apples - money to money.  No oranges need appear in the equation.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>From the perspective of the borrower, his ability to offer a return does not depend on any generalized price index.  It depends on the specific prices that the borrower pays for the factors of production, and the prices that the consumers will pay the borrower.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I believe you'll find that in many industries, very profitable financial investment occurs despite exponentially falling consumer prices.  The classic example is semiconductors.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Fisherine price stabilization was simply a new suit of clothes for the traditional mercantilist strategy of diluting the money supply.  It was accepted in the 20s because it was convenient to the desires of the power centers of that day.  It since has been taken into the canon as a revealed truth.  But it cannot withstand any intelligent scrutiny.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Austrians would be happiest with a fixed supply of money, which would not "stabilize" prices but eliminate exogenous political effects on them, making it as easy as possible to forecast price changes (but, as Einstein put it, no easier).  In theory a fixed money supply could be implemented in a fiat currency, but in practice the temptation to dilute has always proved irresistible.  This is why Austrians, in general, favor the gold standard.

Because US people have a marked tendency to spend (or keep up with the Jones', as was the old saying). In Japan, and other Eastern countries, where their people have a marked tendency to save, reducing interest rates would have very little if any effect. I believe the Fed has misjudged the psychology of the American consumer, just like the BOJ misjudged theirs' some years ago.

The numerator and denominator are both in money - the good being stored.  The rate is negative because of the cost of secure storage.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>In the "catastrophically negative performance of hyperinflation," the numerator is money and the denominator is something else.  Even in a hyperinflation, the laws of logic are not bent and a dollar is still a dollar.  Thus these two situations can coexist.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Various terms such as "inflation," "real," etc, have Fisher's assumption built in.  Ie, they are only meaningful relative to some price index.  If you have any interest in reconsidering Fisher's assumption, you may want to temporarily suspend your usage of these terms.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Pretty beads and the color blue are unlikely to be competitive currencies, because the latter is not scarce and the former is not inelastically supplied.  Vanadium would make a perfectly good currency, especially in an age where electronic cash can denote a warehouse receipt and not require direct coinage, although because of the novelty of this usage any large, correlated increase in the price of vanadium relative to other goods would probably result in a very large increase in global stocks of mined vanadium, making the stuff relatively uncompetitive relative to other candidate currencies.  Gold is the leader both because 5000 years of aggressive gold mining have created an extremely inelastic supply curve, and because only one good needs to have currency status for a stable equilibrium, and gold tends to be chosen because others will choose it (Schelling effect).

If the supply of goods and services is increasing (economic growth) then it must become harder and harder to get dollars in a fixed money supply environment.  The best strategy would seem then to be to hoard dollars and never go into debt.  This doesn't seem to be a good set of incentives to design an economy around.  What am I missing?&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I am sorry if this seems like it is going off the topic of the thread, but the discussion of 'what to do next?' seems to get quickly to fundamental ideas of Friedmanism vs. Austrian libertarianism vs. Keynsian monetarism vs. Rawls vs. utilitarianism.   At least it is naturally going to lead to questioning the role of the Fed, which goes toward the fundamental monetary policy.

But what does he get out of educating another family's child? What does he get out of paving Interstates he may never use? What does he get out of treating the tuberculosis of a prison inmate? &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>He gets a *society*, instead of a bunch of animals trying to grab everything they can for themselves. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>No, the comment was not unfair. We can discuss whether speculators should be excluded from help with mortgages, whether there should be a cap on property size covered by relief, and so on. But to fail to see that we all have a stake in keeping people from homelessness deserves rebuttal. Free market fundamentalism is extremism, and Nouriel was exactly right to slam it. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>As for the doubts expressed by various posters that being evicted will lead to homelessness, they have failed to consider transaction costs. Once you have exhausted your savings and piled debt onto credit cards in an attempt to avoid eviction, you don't have enough to pay a mover, your credit is shot, and you are emotionally at the end of things. The odds of ending up homeless, if not worse, are very high. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>One other point that jg's post reminds me of: foreigners bought a lot, probably 25%, of the securitized mortgages. The US market as a whole will lose credibility if we fail to deal with this problem fairly.

The age of trying to come by easy money. Forget about hard work, saving, getting value an education.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>People have lost the sense of reality; e.g., if you work in the post office you cannot afford to drive a Hummer/live in a million dollar house. People in the US are consuming beyond their means. If you do not produce you are not entitled to consume.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The Professor says:&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>"The analysis above suggests some principles for the coming financial support that will be given with public funds to clean up the unfolding mortgage disaster. First, distinguish between true victims of predatory lending and deadbeat borrowers who were into early strategic default. Early payments default is a clear way to distinguish between inability to pay and unwillingness to pay. Also, means testing for financial support is crucial: low income and low asset households who were pursuing the American Dream and were deceived by lenders may deserve support. But subprime borrowers with higher incomes and/or assets do not deserve support and should be pushed into foreclosure if they are unable or unwilling to service their mortgages."&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>IMO, coming up with any kind of objective/fair scheme to decide who gets help is virtually impossible. The harder I think about it the more I believe that the "optimal solution" (my background is optimization) is the "do nothing approach". Let the chips fall where they should. Anyone who believes they were cheated/forced to take a loan (writing this feels ridiculous) theyy could not afford can take legal action. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Let the bubble burst. Trying to help people stay in houses they cannot afford is ridiculous. Perhaps, once prices correct they can start from zero: bust their behinds working hard to save 20% for a down payment on a piece of property they can afford. Or just pay rent which may even be a smarter alternative.

It is also generally accepted. But, like all intuitively appealing and generally accepted ideas, it needs to be looked at carefully. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>To put the same proposition in slightly different terms, we are very used to thinking the money supply needs to grow as the economy "grows," and if it doesn't there will be some kind of "crunch." In which debtors will, indeed, suffer. And all the historical evidence we have certainly appears to confirm this relationship.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>But historical evidence is not empirical evidence. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Empirical evidence means a controlled experiment in which variables are isolated. Historical evidence gives us the results of a variety of uncontrolled situations whose consequences we know. Anyone doing empirical research who set up his or her experiments in the kinds of random patterns that history gives us would be shot. Feynman's essay on cargo cult science is essential reading for anyone interested in the perils of uncontrolled experiment.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>It is presently impractical to experiment with economic systems containing actual human actors. But, with the growth of virtual worlds, it's starting to become at least conceivable. Suppose this trend continues, and granting agencies support the creation of a software framework for a virtual world which can actually attract real users, and which is designed so that its economic parameters can be tweaked. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>If such controlled experiments then become practical, it is fairly easy to see that they represent altogether another order of science than the results of the uncontrolled experiments that history has presented us with. The latter can then be discarded - along with pretty much all of 20th-century positivist economics, which from the perspective of the 21st century will appear to be nothing more than a pseudoscience. Nor is it clear that we need to wait for the results of these experiments to appear. For if the word "science" has any meaning, pseudoscience is pseudoscience - it is invariably inferior to honest and acknowledged ignorance.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The problem with uncontrolled experiments is that they are subject to selection bias. In other words, they tend to tell you what you want (or at least expect) to hear.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>So the historical evidence gives us some reason to believe that there is a relationship between policies that freeze or contract the supply of present money, and unpleasant economic effects. We can agree that these effects are not desirable.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>But what we don't know is the nature of this relationship. We don't know the structure of cause and effect. All we have is a few simple mathematical models that are back-tested against history. These models (such as the quantity theory of money, the IS-LM curve, the Phillips curve, the Taylor rule, etc, etc) in general do not purport to describe any emergent behavior of real economic actors. They are a mix of tautologies (Murray Rothbard once compared the quantity theory of money to the hypothesis that the amount of water that hits the ground is the amount of rain that falls out of the sky) and historically validated rules of thumb.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The idea that any policy formed as a result of these kinds of models must be "scientific" is astounding. I suspect to our children it will appear comical, though ruefully so.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>To understand this, let's consider two different perspectives that are consistent with the historical relationship between monetary growth and macroeconomic stability that we've observed so far.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Perspective A tells us that monetary growth is like eating. You can injure yourself by eating too little, or too much. You can starve to death, or you can get fat and even burst your stomach, as in the Monty Python sketch. Perhaps deflation is like starving yourself, and hyperinflation is like bursting your stomach. Therefore the optimal policy must be a moderate and stable balance between these two extreme endpoints.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Perspective B tells us that monetary growth is like shooting heroin. When you stop shooting heroin, you are guaranteed to feel awful. In fact, for some drugs (like barbiturates) withdrawal can actually be fatal. Heroin addicts have to do heroin all the time just to feel normal, but (I assume) there's still a little rush when you shoot up, then a crash later. And, of course, if you do too much, you can kill yourself. So deflation is like withdrawal and hyperinflation is like overdose. It is possible to coast along as a functional addict on a maintenance dose, with those little ups and downs, surviving indefinitely. But this certainly does not change the fact that the optimal amount of heroin for anyone to be shooting is none at all.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>My point is that historical evidence does not give us any way to distinguish between these alternatives. If we are unable to run a controlled experiment and we want to decide which perspective is right, we need to resort to deductive logic - the Austrian specialty. (Sometimes you will hear people call it "praxeology" or "catallactics," but these terms never really caught on.)&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Deductive logic has gotten a bad rap because it is very easy to construct gigantic, intricate chains of deductive reasoning which have some little syllogistic screw loose, and thus are effectively a cathedral of lies. There is no way around this difficulty. One simply has to be careful. Compared to the risks of uncontrolled experiment, as I think I've demonstrated, these ancient, creaky castles of Teutonic logic are positively salubrious. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>One notes, for example, that there is no math at all in Dr. Roubini's post above. Deductive economics, which was the method not only of the 19th century but of all preceding ones, was widely mocked as "literary economics." But those who laugh last laugh loudest.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>So let's apply the analytical method again to your question.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>We see immediately that the analysis of lending given in my prior post above is correct - for new loans. Lending will occur when some method of production can produce any positive rate of interest (or even a negative rate which nonetheless exceeds the cost of secure monetary storage). Of course, this is an inherently speculative process and can only be predicted by the "wisdom of crowds," but both historical and analytic methods agree on said wisdom.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>However - contrary to the "free-market fundamentalists" - market projection of results is not magic. It is the result of a consensus about reality. The market will be wrong - and the borrowers, for example, default unexpectedly - if its projection about the results of the borrowers' business activity is incorrect.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>An exogenous change in price levels due to an unanticipated money supply shock is certainly a force that can result in such error. Again for both historical and analytic reasons, we would expect monetary contraction to lead, ceteris paribus, to falling prices. That is, prices fall relative to the borrower's projections, and this causes his or her calculations of profitability to be incorrect, resulting in defaults, etc.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>This analysis therefore corresponds to perspective B of the choice above. It says that "deflation" is like heroin withdrawal, not like starvation. And it suggests that the reason 20th-century attempts to return to the gold standard did not succeed is the same reason that most people don't succeed in getting off heroin. Perhaps naive liquidation, Andrew Mellon style, simply doesn't work, or at least is too stressful for our political system.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>(Incidentally, there is historical evidence to "support" this analysis: the Bank of Amsterdam period in the Dutch Golden Age, in which there was no fractional-reserve banking and all money supply increases were due to new gold production. Lending, even very risky lending, was by no means absent in this period. But I put "support" in quotes for a reason - I think a better word is "illustrate." For reasons which I now hope are obvious.)&nbsp;<br/>

Again thank the free market fundamentalist zealots who love no regulation and little taxation of capital for this sorry state." &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I couldn't agree with you more! We, as a nation, have wasted so much time. As we continue to export manufacturing jobs, our reliance on imported energy only deepens. There are a number of organizations, that would like to see this nation embrace renewable energy. We're talking about creating tens of thousands of jobs. Are "Financial Products" the best we can do? We used to be a nation of builders. And I'm not talking about houses. There are some great, small startup companies with great idea's. Silicon valley is sprouting up a number of them. "Tesla" is one of them; they build electric sports cars. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Having an "Oil man" in the White House is the last thing we need right now. We need new ideas, not the same old tired cr*p! Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world. We all now this is the reason we're in Iraq now. It's a terrible waste of lives and money. We should be running away from oil, not toward it! &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Bush likes to pretend he favors renewable energy. But don't forget, a few months ago he had to restore funding in a hurry to the NREL lab in Boulder, CO because his trainers &nbsp;<br/>had scheduled a PR stop shortly before layoffs were going to occur due to his funding cuts. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>With the proper incentives, renewable energy products such as advanced batteries, solar cells, ocean power, advanced geothermal power and wind energy could increase production in this country. Also, electric cars, and plug-in hybrid cars, these could be the products worth building. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

Those who originated the loans knowing full well that those who were granted these loans would never be able to repay them.  These companies were driven by greed knowing that they would sell the loan, where it would be repackaged and end up in some poor slobs 401k.  (Probably mine).  So I’m getting hit twice for these practices.  Once in my retirement account, and again when the government uses money to bail them out that could be put to good use somewhere else. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>What also bothers me are those who treated their homes like ATM machines and withdrew every last bit of equity and then some to finance their spending sprees.

Will it be thousands? Hundreds of thousands? Millions? A lot will depend on leadership by the national government. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>You also claim that "If people were the victim of fraud, then a crime was committed and they won't be foreclosed."&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>So *you* say. The law takes a long time to act, and many people will face foreclosure before some of the criminal schemes that have been operating are prosecuted. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>artichoke says, "If people need help, there are some programs like section 8 subsidized rent, and AFDC if they have dependent children.

I think there is a tendency to take having a reasonably functioning society for granted, but history shows that this is by far the exception.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Still, in the sense that a radical critique can be an useful analytical tool and guide useful change, I think that questioning down to first principles can be extremely valuable.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Many are protesting that Dr. Roubini is veering into 'politics', but there will certainly be some forms of political response to what is happening in the marketplace. Judging from the comments, determining the best course of action involves fundamental ideas of economic justice which informs people's view of how our current institutional framework may have failed.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>On the one hand there is a strong influence of libertarian ideas of justice, that the just society is one in which the distribution of economic goods most closely adheres to the decisions of free individuals in the marketplace. On the other hand there is also a strong influence of utilitarian ideas of justice, in which the just society is one in which the distribution of economic goods produces the best outcome for the most people. Libertarians often accuse utilitarians of being 'socialist' but this isn't true at all. Most libertarians are utilitarians on odd days of the week anyway. Besides, nearly all utilitarians view the free market as the best way to means to achieve material progress and prosperity for society.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Both the Friedmanist and Austrian flavors of libertarian economics aren't really libertarian. They are utilitarian when convenient and libertarian when convenient. In one paragraph you have, 'Don't use my money to solve society', which is libertarian, and in the next, 'If the government would just get out of the way, we would all be better off,' which is utilitarian.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I think that we are reaching a crisis point soon in which the libertarian arguments have a real possibility of preventing our society from acting to head off a deep economic collapse. This is why the politics are important, and why thoughtful people need to sharpen their arguments. I think there is a real complacency to the idea that 'they will just become renters', which conveniently ignores the possibility of a banking and monetary crisis which may just take 'your money' and 'your opportunity' whether you like it or not.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I am afraid that the quality of our current politics in Washington is too degraded to arrive at useful solutions. Quality discussion only seems to happen when there is big money on both sides of an issue 'satellite vs. cable' or 'candy makers vs. sugar producers'. The idea that we are going to have a productive debate when it is 'the people' as a whole whose interests need representing has become laughable at best. As a life-long Democrat, I am really hoping for my party to step forward but not holding my breath.

Their loans are beginning to reset. &nbsp;<br/>I could easily take either side of this discussion. Why should I have to help homebuyers (via taxes) that decided to buy a house at such high, unsustainable prices? Then again, how many people were pulled into the “mania” that home prices will go up forever? Two years ago, I remember having doubts about my decision to continue renting. My wife thought I was wrong at the time. &nbsp;<br/>The solution must involve prosecution of solicitors of predatory loans, and of appraisers, lenders and realtors involved in schemes to pump up the value of homes for 120% loans for quick profits. &nbsp;<br/>The solutions will be many for the plight of those caught in the housing mania. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>For my family, the solution is to move out of California.

Next month, 3 year ARM holders will understand why that was a bad decision. There are 2 waves of ARM mortgage rate increases coming. The first wave will occur in April on 3 year ARMs. This is hard to believe, but if interest rates remain the same in the next few weeks, then these ARM mortgage holders will see a 100% increase in their interest rate. If they were to refinance today, they would see a 60% increase in their rate. The second wave of increases will begin this Summer on the 5 year ARMs, and will continue to run for the next few years unless homeowners refinance. The best hope these people have now, is for us to have a large enough slowdown in the economy that would cause Bernanke to lower interest rates.&nbsp;<br/>      While some market analyst were only worrying about defaults coming from sub-prime loans, they forgot to look at the mortgage defaults that will occur because of the 3 and 5 year ARMs. What this means is that we are likely to see these problems filter down to the banking industry, and that would put pressure on the market. Analyst are telling us that these problems are not affecting the banks. The reality is, that these problems take time to filter down to banking financials. Over the next few months, you will hear how banks will have to increase their default reserves, and how it will begin to affect their profits."

Corn is not a good feedstock for ethanol production. I believe to energy ratio is 1.2:1.  While with sugar cane it is 7:1, that is seven times as much energy is obtained that that used to process the sugar cane.  The one good thing about corn ethanol is that it’s helping to produce a need for flex-fuel vehicles.  I strongly support cellulose ethanol production. Making ethanol from waste products makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;<br/>A few years ago, I got on the hydrogen bandwagon, as did many others.  IMHO, with current technology, it just doesn’t make sense.  If you use natural gas to produce hydrogen, you’re still using a finite fossil fuel.  If you produce hydrogen via electrolysis of water, you’re losing energy in the conversion process.  Better to use the electricity directly.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>IMO, plug-in hybrids make the most sense.  Battery development has reached an interesting level.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Coal gasification makes more sense than extracting energy from “oil sands”, though I worry about the CO2 release.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Another interesting fuel is Bio-Butanol, which doesn’t require any modification to an engine.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I realize that many on this blog probably feel that I’ve gotten way off topic.  Please keep in mind that cheap energy helped kick start this nation in the first place.  During WWII, the U.S. was the largest oil producer. Germany and Japan were envious. Oil prices in the $50-$60 range is a flat tax on all Americans.  Those that can least afford the higher gas prices are the same folks that are in trouble with their subprime mortgages. &nbsp;<br/>

Brazil even exports this cheap ethanol since they produce more than enough to satisfy their own needs. And most Brazilian cars run on pure ethanol. However the US has imposed a tariff of somewhere around 50 cents/gallon on imported ethanol from Brazil. This is interference in free trade, just like the agricultural subsidies, and makes fuel more expensive for US consumers. In order to protect some special interest group with some voting power I guess.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Ernst

Most of what is said on this thread is reasonable considering that we all have different perspectives from our own life experiences. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Renting is not something that would suit me or most people given a choice. There are many factors besides the monetary issues. There is the ownership. That gives people a different outlook from a renter. Mowing your own lawn is a much different feeling than mowing the owner’s lawn. Some on this thread must never have been poor and had to rent. Let me tell you, it wasn’t hard to talk those people into a risky loan with the promise of ownership. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I have things that belonged to grand parents and things I have acquired over the years. I also have tools which at one point in my life were very important to me and I still use. Having a secure place to have them vs. a 30 day notice to move to me makes the issue of ownership a much bigger issue for me. How can a person travel for weeks and longer with out a place to have keepsakes and comfort to return to. It would be extremely uncomfortable for me to rent. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>That said, I think I understand why people get in over their heads. Some are pure speculators and take risks but most others just get caught. They need a place and are offered a loan which on the surface they can afford. How many of you have been to a real estate closing involving a loan. Many times the package of papers is three quarters of an inch thick. People aren’t given the loan documents a week a head of time to read and ask questions about. The first time they see them is at the closing. The mortgage broker is on a commission and makes more money with more transactions. They really don’t want to be educators, they may not even understand all the language themselves. In most states, they don’t even have a license much less any real training about what they sell themselves. This part of the system is the wild west and totally unregulated. There are suppose to be checks and balances but the people responsible are often the same people who benefit from the volume. It is like the rating agencies which get paid by the people they rate. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>So, people take the risky loans because the nice person wearing nice clothes told them that they could afford it. Then over the next year some unexpected thing happens, the car breaks down or the kid has to go to the emergency room or the heating system has to be repaired and the next thing they know they are behind on their payments. All the while the government makes deals with the corn growers to produce ethanol and food has been costing more almost each week and gasoline has gone up too. So at the end of the month do they pay their mortgage or the credit card which they can not live with out as they need it to buy gas and food. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>This is the frog in the water syndrome. Inflation is the real killer and will continue to hurt. The fed says it is fighting inflation while all the figures I have seen show that the money supply continues to grow. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>At this point, if the fed doesn’t fight inflation, they will put more and more people  at risk of losing their homes but if they do fight it, they could cause stocks to drop and harm themselves and their friends. What do you think they will do tomorrow? What is best for the most people or what is best for their own peer group? &nbsp;<br/>

If the late, "great" subprime sector had a tombstone, that would be a fitting epitaph for New Century Financial and others.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>...&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070705213834/http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/ContrarianChronicles/WarningThisMessWillOnlyGetWorse.aspx" target="_blank">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/ContrarianChronicles/WarningThisMessWillOnlyGetWorse.aspx</a>

Yes, there certainly seems to be a strong possibility of a banking and monetary crisis. Day by day emerging evidence seems to suggest that it has even gone beyond possibility to emerging actuality.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The possibility that this crisis may take 'your money' and 'your opportunity' is all too real. There are at least two choices, to try the bandaid, or glue and duct tape, approach to keeping a financial and monetary system, which has served some well and some not so well, afloat, or alternatively allow the natural consequences of poor financial and economic choices to run their course by taking its own medicine. In all likelihood, the the first alternatives would probably be doing litle more than delaying the second alternative.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Moreover, since this seems to be a juncture we have not been to before in our global economic and monetary system, it is a speculative to believe that there are not some entities who have made wiser economic choices who will step into the picture and acquire assets at firesale prices. Good for them, not so good for those parting with the assets. It does appear, however, to be the way of human economic behavior.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Rather than the anguished hand wringing over the possible end of an established order, it might be more productive to try to identify where the shelters from the storm may lie and be ready to step in to help rebuild at the appropriate time, both for the greater good as well as in self-interest.

This entry needs a lot of editing. You basically say the same thing over &amp; over &amp; over until you've run out of ways to describe "free market voodoo economic fundamentalist laissez-faire zealot extremsists" in the most reactionary &amp; hyperbolic terms available. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>All forms of regulation are pragmatic &amp; sensible &amp; carry zero consequences. People who support regulation for the sake of regulation are all right thinking, pragmatic &amp; sensible people, and the only people who could oppose such regulation, or lobby for less of it is a hard-core free-market extremsist cowboy capitalist apparantly. For a reference point, since we know Mr. Roubini is the bench mark for right-thinking pragmatic &amp; sensible economic thought(those economic commentators who disagree with him being extremist zealots), just how far are you allowed to diverge from this view without being labeled an extremist free market fundamentalist voodoo economics supply-side laissez-faire zealot?

I especially like your increasingly colorful language as this mess unfolds.  I did not, however, understand your point about the U.S. investing in housing while the rest of the world has been investing in more productive assets.  It seems that you are suggesting that the housing bubble is a uniquely American phenomenon.  I don't think this is accurate.  Many parts of the world, such as many countries in Western Europe, Australia, South Korea, etc. have seen price runups even greater than our own.  I believe that when we go into recession their housing bubbles will burst as well.

I say.  I’m sick of hearing stories about the “poor people” who got duped into bad loans.  Call it schadenfreude.  (My favorite word)  &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Let’s take a second to think about it.  There are a few big decisions you have to make in life.  Getting married, having children, buying a car and buying a house.  (sure there are other big decisions, but I’ll keep this as short as I can.)  Why would someone throw caution to the wind on any of these decisions?  …and if and when something goes wrong with one of these decisions, it usually takes a great deal of time/work/effort to recover.  That recovery usually builds character, and teaches us valuable lessons!&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>As I’ve stated on past posts, my wife and I do pretty well with income and savings.  In addition, we are nearly debt free. (with our only exception being the remaining half of my wife’s student loan for law school.)  We are still renting a 1 bedroom apartment and have been for almost 8 years now!  (while trying to save up enough for a house.)  We have 2 kids.  (1 in our bedroom, and 1 in a makeshift bedroom)&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Am I actually supposed to feel sympathy for the schlep that got themselves in over their head and didn’t make a RESPONSIBLE DECISION with what amounts to the most important fiancial decision most of us will ever make in our life?  NO!  Am I actually supposed to pay more in taxes so that the same schlep can keep their house that they didn’t deserve in the first place?  NO! &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Losing something you shouldn’t have had isn’t really “losing something”.  It was borrowed, and now it’s time to return it!  &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I’m glad to say this!  Put their house on the market!  Flood the market.  (8 years into renting and I can only now just afford a house in my Brooklyn neighborhood with 20% down payment.)  Let’s see a devaluation of at least 10% on houses.  So I don’t have to use my entire savings on that 20%.  (I’ve been responsible for 8 years, and it’s time I get some reward!)&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Foreclose away, and when that family of 4 needs a place to stay, I’ll hopefully have a 1 bedroom apartment available for them.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Rich H&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>p.s.  I’m beginning to think this credit crunch / crash will never happen.  Between the Gov’t pumping money into the system, and financial institutions being allowed to use loose accounting methods to mask losses, all we keep seeing is “record earnings”  (MS today).  If $millions/billions/trillions of dollars are really missing or overstated, and no institutions are forced to show these loses, then the bulls/gov’t/brokers/hedgefds/corrupt will never slow down.  How does this cycle stop?  Who stops it?&nbsp;<br/>

I thought we would have paid a long time ago, but trends are persistent -- but not eternal!&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The only thing I disagree with -- strongly -- is that any of these borrowers should get a special bailout.  As I said earlier, there is AFDC, section 8 rental, and other programs for poor people.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>People who become poor because they were over-consuming housing don't deserve better treatment (to say the least) than those who become poor because -- say -- they are not blessed with high intelligence or had bad family circumstances or other reasons.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The comment from Rich H is exactly right.  He's been responsible and saved and probably been looked down on by others who played the max-mortgage real estate game.  Now he deserves at least some reward at their expense. 
<br/><div class="commentcredit">Written by artichoke on 2007-03-21 11:03:25</div></div><a name="akocomment44828"></a> <div class="commentbox">I too agree with Rich H that there should be no bailout for anyone. Not because I am a free market fundamentalist; far from it. Nor because I love schadenfreude.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>But because the bubble priced out even many highly accomplished people who couldn't do anything but wait, sometimes at great personal and social costs. There was no reason for a rational human being to jump in if he/she could not afford the mortgage.  Those who did jump in, in the anticipation of prices continuing to rise, cannot expect to be rewarded now for their bad decisions. In cases where buyers were misled by lenders or brokers, it is for some NGO's or the Fed Govt. to take legal action and make the offenders pay.  &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>When there is a game of life all of us are expected (and forced for our own survival) to play, there cannot be a change in the rules of the game halfway, favoring some people selectively. One either changes the game entirely, or the players live with whatever outcome results from the game.

You are solely responsible for your RGE registration and account information, content, messages or other information (&quot;User Content&quot;) that You submit, publish or display (herein after, &quot;post&quot;) on any RGE Site or transmit to other Users. By posting User Content to any RGE Site, You automatically grant, and You represent and warrant that You have the right to grant, to RGE an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid, worldwide license to use, copy, perform, display, and distribute such User Content and to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such User Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses thereof.

By posting User Content to any public or non-public area of any RGE Site, including message boards and forums, You grant the Company and its affiliates the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers), non-exclusive right (including any moral rights) and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, communicate to the public, perform and display the User Content (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed, for the full term of any rights that may exist in such content.

Subject to the foregoing, the owner of such User Content placed any RGE Site retains any and all rights that may exist in such User Content.

The Company acts as a passive conduit for the online distribution and publication of User Content and has no obligation to screen communications or information in advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring User Content posted by Users.

The Company reserves the right to expel Users and prevent their further access to the RGE Blog Sites for violating the Terms of Use or applicable law, rule or regulation and the right to remove User Content which is in violation of the Terms of Use, abusive, illegal, or disruptive. The Company may take any action with respect to User Content that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if it believes it may create liability for the Company or may cause the Company to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its ISPs or other suppliers.

The following is a partial list of User Content that is prohibited on the RGE Blog Sites. The list below is for illustration only and is not a complete list of all prohibited User Content:

It is also a violation of the Terms of Use, to include in any User Content submitted to RGE Monitor that may be interpreted as direct solicitation, advertisement or recruitment for an available job position directed to individuals seeking employment on either a full time or part time basis.

In order to protect our RGE Monitor Users from unauthorized commercial advertising or solicitation, RGE reserves the right to restrict the number of Comments a user may send in a 24 hour period to a number which RGE deems appropriate in its sole discretion.

RGE reserves the right in its sole discretion to investigate and take legal action against anyone who engages in any illegal or prohibited conduct or otherwise violates these Terms of Use, including without limitation, removing the User Content from the RGE Blog Sites and/or terminating the offending User's ability to access the RGE Blog Sites and/or use RGE services.

If, despite our request, You send us creative suggestions, ideas, drawings, concepts, inventions, or other information (collectively the &quot;Submission&quot;), the Submission shall be the property of the Company. None of the Submission shall be subject to any obligation of confidentiality on our part and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submission.

8. The Company's Liability. 

Rgemonitor.com acts as an information service that aggregated global macro economic and geostrategic information. The Company is not involved in the actual transactions based on the content posted on the RGE Site. As a result, the Company has no control over the quality, safety or legality of the linked content.

Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, the Company cannot and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be.

If You are a California resident, You waive California Civil Code d1542, which says: &quot;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&quot;

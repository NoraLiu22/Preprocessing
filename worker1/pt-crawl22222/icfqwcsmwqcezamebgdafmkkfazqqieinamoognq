  <p>New Yorkers are falling for Australian-style cafes, complete with flat whites and smashed avocado.</p><p>It's not just the good coffee and healthy, delicious food, according to Oliver Strand, a food critic who publishes in the New York Times.</p><p>Australian cafes also bring a different vibe to the Big Apple.</p><p>"With the audience in New York, I think it's a welcome surprise," he told 7.30.</p><p>"This is not as cold and mean a town as some people might think — it's actually a very warm place.</p><p>"But it's also a busy place, so to have these places to go for breakfast and a coffee is a novelty.</p><p>"It's lovely, you know, it's like having flowers and chocolates and a spa day or something like that.</p><p>"It's not what you do in New York, you grab it, you go, you grab it, you throw it back. It's very rush, rush."</p><h2>Bluestone Lane Coffee</h2><div class="inline-content photo full">

      </a></div><p> </p><p>Giles Russell is another member of the Australian cohort.</p><p>With Two Hands, he's transplanted a version of his local Bondi coastal cafe into urban New York.</p><p>"We wanted to work together to tell the rest of New York, 'hey, this is a different style of coffee, a different style of food and a different style of culture that you're buying into'," Mr Russell told 7.30.</p><p>"[In Australia] when you walked out your front door that was like the logical next step — I'm going to go to a cafe and get my flat white or my three-quarter flat white and the barista will know me, the owner will know me, I'll be greeted, that will make me feel good, I'll feel comfortable in here.</p><p>"I felt that was really missing in New York."</p><p>Two Hands general manager Tim Burnett said while it was the coffee that initially turned heads, it's the vibe that really captures New Yorkers.</p><p>"The coffee really amazes people, but I think good coffee is catching on in the US, and has been for a few years," he said.</p><p>"But the culture, definitely, it does amaze people.</p><p>"They really enjoy coming in and having this really nice vibe, really casual vibe."</p><p>"It's a good experience, I think, for Americans."</p><p>And for Australians it also means a trip to America can now include a decent coffee.</p><div class="inline-content photo right">

       Food critic Oliver Strand first alerted New Yorkers to the phenomenon of Australian cafes in an article published in the New York Times</a></div><p> </p><p>"Once Australians realised that they could bring what they know from home and that New Yorkers would respond, then it freed them to open Australian-style coffee shops," Strand said.</p><p>"You didn't have to adhere to any model or a US model, you could actually do what you want, you could put an avocado toast on the menu and it will fly out the door."</p><p>Strand now places Aussie cafes next to what he calls the 'unofficial embassies' like British pubs and French bistros, that bring something from home to America.</p><p>"New York will always be New York, but it's like a snapshot, it's almost a postcard, of what you have in Australia," he said.</p><p>And then there's the accent.</p><p>"Americans love an Australian accent," Strand said.</p><p>"So for somebody to say, 'would you like a coffee' in an Australian accent is like having somebody whisper a love poem in French in your ear."</p>

<h2 class="operationsTitle">2012 UNHCR country operations profile - Afghanistan</h2>
<h3>Working environment</h3>
<h4>The context</h4>
<p><a class="lightbox floatright" rel="lightbox" href="/web/20120604063834/http://www.unhcr.org/images/operationsMaps/country-afg.jpg"><img src="/web/20120604063834im_/http://www.unhcr.org/images/operationsMaps/country-afg-400.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The situation in Afghanistan remains volatile, with continuing conflict and random violence causing further internal displacement. The lack of security hinders UNHCR's operations and access to people of concern. Another challenge is to ensure regular and reliable information on areas in which UNHCR operates, so that policies can be implemented effectively and safely. The political situation continues to be in flux, although measures to promote security and stability are pursued by international and national actors.</p>
<p>The people of concern to UNHCR in Afghanistan total some 1.3 million, comprising asylum-seekers, refugees, returning refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). UNHCR provides protection and supports policies and mechanisms that promote the sustainable reintegration of returning refugees. It also responds to the immediate humanitarian needs of IDPs and, where possible, pursues durable solutions for them.</p>
<p>In addition to the establishment of peace and security, the key to Afghanistan's future stability is an improvement in the services provided by the Government to its citizens. It is a cornerstone of UNHCR's strategy to support the efforts of the Government in this area, particularly through District Offices throughout the country.</p>
<p>Preparations are ongoing for the Afghan Stakeholders Conference scheduled for early 2012. The Conference will establish a platform for dialogue among relevant stakeholders from Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan. A three-year road map for action will be drawn up and will include the identification of strategic partnerships, and the investments required to achieve a set of comprehensive solutions to the displacement issues that have risen as a result of the conflict in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Through its leadership of the protection and emergency-shelter clusters, as well as the IDP Task Force, UNHCR is responsible for coordinating joint humanitarian activities in Afghanistan.</p>
<h4>The needs</h4>
<p>More than 5.7 million refugees -- 4.6 million of them with UNHCR assistance -- have returned to Afghanistan since 2002, increasing the population of the country by some 25 per cent. UNHCR has conducted an assessment in 2011, to gauge the level of reintegration achieved by the returnees. The survey, which covered both urban and rural areas, has shown that more than 40 per cent of returnees have not reintegrated into their home communities. Similar conclusions were reached by a joint UNHCR and World Bank study among urban populations. Specific areas needing improvement include land tenure and housing, livelihood opportunities, and access to public services and water.</p>
<p>The first half of 2011 has seen a rapid increase in conflict-induced internal displacement in Afghanistan, creating nearly 100,000 new IDPs and bringing the total IDP population to approximately 500,000 people. Securing access to the displaced, responding to their immediate needs and pursuing advocacy aimed at reducing displacement and promoting returns are key tasks for UNHCR. The same applies to the humanitarian assistance being provided by UNHCR to those affected and displaced by natural disasters.</p>
<p>Although the number of refugees who have fled to Afghanistan is small in comparison with that of IDPs and returnees in the country, there is neither a legal framework nor appropriate mechanisms to respond to their protection and assistance needs. Another systemic problem is the lack of facilities to solve land disputes, which prolongs displacement.</p>
<p>Cultural, informal and religious laws, which are frequently used in the settlement of disputes, are often at odds with international standards. This is particularly the case with regard to the protection needs of women and girls. Carefully calibrated approaches are therefore required to ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to address such issues. Another cause of concern is the number of Afghan minors arriving in Europe in recent years. Dealing with this will require coordination with the Afghan authorities and relevant international organizations.</p>

<h3>Main objectives and targets for 2012</h3>
<h4>Basic needs and essential services</h4>
<p>People of concern are provided with sufficient supplies of basic and domestic items.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Some 300,000 refugee returnees (50,000 families), including those who had returned the previous year, and 120,000 IDPs (20,000 families) receive non-food item (NFI) packages.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Durable solutions</h4>
<p>The potential for voluntary return to Afghanistan is realized.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Some 162,000 Afghan refugees repatriate voluntarily and receive a cash grant.  </em></li>
<li><em>About 7,400 of the most vulnerable refugee returnees receive additional material support upon arrival.  </em></li>
</ul>
<p>The potential for resettlement is realized.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Individuals identified for resettlement are provided with travel expenses to third countries.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>External relations</h4>
<p>Coordination and partnerships with other actors are strengthened through joint assessments, planning and evaluation as well as the establishment of coordination mechanisms.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Government, relevant UN agencies, NGO partners and donors provide reintegration assistance to beneficiaries at a number of selected sites and communities to ensure sustainable return.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy and activities in 2012</h3>
<p>UNHCR's objectives are aligned with the Afghanistan National Development Strategy and the UN Integrated Strategic Framework. With more than 2.7 million Afghan refugees in the region and an estimated 3 million around the world, UNHCR will continue to support members of this caseload to repatriate voluntarily to Afghanistan. It will seek to improve immediate return assistance and also pursue a more comprehensive approach to sustainable reintegration.</p>
<p>UNHCR's transitional solutions initiative, which bridges the gap between humanitarian assistance and development, seeks closer cooperation with other UN agencies and Afghan line ministries. Lessons learned from a pilot reintegration programme implemented in 2011 are currently informing this multi-year strategy, which promotes targeted community-based interventions in areas of high return, designed to raise returnees' standards of living to national levels. Key areas of intervention include shelter, income generation, livelihoods, water and education. Up to 20,000 houses will also be provided to returning refugees to order to sustain their return.</p>
<p>For IDPs, UNHCR is engaged in direct data management, tracking, protection coordination and humanitarian assistance. Advocacy in support of prevention, response and durable solutions also remains key. UNHCR helps IDPs to return to their areas of origin in safety and dignity by providing them with logistics and shelter support, as well as protection.</p>
<p>UNHCR is working with the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation in drafting refugee legislation. Pending the establishment of Government procedures, UNHCR conducts direct refugee status determination (RSD) and pursues durable solutions for those found to be in need of international protection.</p>
<p>UNHCR provides legal information and advice to people of concern in Afghanistan, and provides material assistance to people with specific needs.</p>
<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>Insecurity, political instability and economic and social problems are likely to continue in 2012 and may increase as international forces transfer security responsibilities to national partners. Military operations, including those in response to violent incidents and armed fighters, may cause further displacement. Efforts to access and provide immediate and timely humanitarian assistance to the newly displaced may be hampered by insecurity. Currently, the UN has direct access to less than half the country. Though UNHCR has put in place innovative measures to expand its reach, including through partners, access to people of concern remains precarious. UNHCR will continue to review its operational environment to ensure staff safety and security. Appropiate mitigation measures may have significant resource implications.</p>
<p>Sustainable reintegration is facing new challenges as competition for land, water, natural resources and employment grows sharper. Access to employment is frequently constrained by the lack of social and economic networks. Moreover, the overwhelming development needs in the country make it increasingly difficult for UNHCR to secure sufficient resources to support returning refugees.</p>
<h3>Organization and implementation</h3>
<h4>Coordination</h4>
<p>UNHCR engages actively with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Rural Rehabilitation, and Housing and Urban Development. The main government counterpart -- the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation -- will be assisted to strengthen its management capacity related to policy development, emergency response and technical assistance. Greater operational responsibilities for repatriation, monitoring and speedy identification of IDPs will be entrusted to relevant District Offices.</p>
<p>The active engagement of other key partners will also be sought. These partners include the Ministries of Justice; Labour and Social Welfare (for skills training and employment of returnees); and Women's Affairs, as well as local civil society organizations for gender issues. UNHCR will continue to support the Information and Legal Aid Centres run by the Norwegian Refugee Council. The centres provide legal services and train lawyers, judges, local authorities and other actors who participate in informal systems for the resolution of disputes.</p>
<p>As part of the UN Country Team, UNHCR works with UNAMA, UNDP, UN-Habitat, WFP, ILO, WHO and UNICEF as well as the World Bank. UNHCR's role in leading the protection and emergency shelter clusters as well as co-chairing the national and regional IDP task forces will continue. Cooperation will be strengthened with OCHA and with IOM, as designated lead agency for the coordination of natural disaster-induced displacements, assistance to vulnerable deportees and migration issues.</p>
<p>Special attention will be paid to fostering cooperation with major UN agencies, relevant government departments and other actors in selected sites and communities, to ensure comprehensive reintegration interventions. An MOU recently concluded with UNDP will form an integral part of the new reintegration strategy. Partner mobilization will aim to enhance the protection and reintegration of people of concern and to optimize UNHCR's response to emergency situations. Communications with other stakeholders and public information campaigns will highlight the impact of these efforts.</p>
<h3>Financial information</h3>
<p>The budget in 2012 for Afghanistan has increased by USD 39 million from 2011, owing to renewed efforts to promote the sustainable reintegration of refugee returnees, to address the needs of increasing numbers of IDPs, and to enhance the security of staff and implementing partners. The trends over the past years show that the funds required for Afghanistan have remained stable, though substantial, reflecting the needs of the continuously growing number of people of concern to UNHCR in the country.</p>

<div class="rightComponent"><div class="inlineGBlurb hidTag" id="inlineGBlurb-49c3bcf77"><h2>Rebuilding Lives in Afghanistan</h2><p>With elections scheduled in October, 2004 is a crucial year for the future of Afghanistan, and Afghans are returning to their homeland in record numbers. In the first seven months of 2004 alone, more than half a million returned from exile. In all, more than 3.6 million Afghans have returned since UNHCR's voluntary repatriation programme started in 2002.</p>

<p>The UN refugee agency and its partner organisations are working hard to help the returnees rebuild their lives in Afghanistan. Returnees receive a grant to cover basic needs, as well as access to medical facilities, immunisations and landmine awareness training.</p>

<p>UNHCR's housing programme provides tool kits and building supplies for families to build new homes where old ones have been destroyed. The agency also supports the rehabilitation of public buildings as well as programmes to rehabilitate the water supply, vocational training and cash-for-work projects.</p>

<p>Return is only the first step on Afghanistan's long road to recovery. UNHCR is helping returnees settle back home with repatriation packages, shelter kits, mine-awareness training and vaccination against diseases. Slowly but surely, Afghans across the land are reuniting with loved ones, reconstructing homes, going back to school and resuming work. A new phase in their lives has begun.</p>

<p>Although landless returnees are eligible for the Afghan government's land allocation scheme, demand far outstrips supply. By the end of 2007, the authorities were developing 14 settlements countrywide. Nearly 300,000 returnee families had applied for land, out of which 61,000 had been selected and 3,400 families had actually moved into the settlements.</p>

<p>Desperate returnees sometimes have to camp in open areas or squat in abandoned buildings. Others occupy disputed land where aid agencies are not allowed to build permanent structures such as wells or schools.</p>

<p>One resilient community planted itself in a desert area called Tangi in eastern Afghanistan. With help from the Afghan private sector and the international community, water, homes, mosques and other facilities have sprouted &#8211; proof that the right investment and commitment can turn barren land into the good earth.</p>

</h2><p>A UNHCR-funded project in Kabul, Afghanistan, is helping to keep returnee children off the streets by teaching them to read and write, give them room to play and offer vocational training in useful skills such as tailoring, flower making, and hairstyling.</p>

<p>Every day, Afghan children ply the streets of Kabul selling anything from newspapers to chewing gum, phone cards and plastic bags. Some station themselves at busy junctions and weave through traffic waving a can of smoking coal to ward off the evil eye. Others simply beg from passing strangers.</p>

<p>There are an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 street children in the Afghan capital alone. Among them are those who could not afford an education as refugees in Iran or Pakistan, and are unable to go to school as returnees in Afghanistan because they have to work from dawn to dusk to support their families. For the past seven years, a UNHCR-funded project has been working to bring change.</p>

With more than 5 million Afghans returning home since 2002, Afghanistan's absorption capacity is reaching saturation point.</p>

<p>Landmine awareness training at UNHCR's encashment centres &#8211; their first stop after returning from decades in exile &#8211; is a sombre reminder of the immense challenges facing this war-torn country. Many returnees and internally displaced Afghans are struggling to rebuild their lives. Some are squatting in tents in the capital, Kabul. Basic needs like shelter, land and safe drinking water are seldom met. Jobs are scarce, and long queues of men looking for work are a common sight in marketplaces.</p>

<p>Despite the obstacles, their spirit is strong. Returning Afghans &#8211; young and old, women and men &#8211; seem determined to do their bit for nation building, one brick at a time.</p>

<p>After more than two decades of war, Afghanistan faces enormous recovery needs. The rugged, landlocked nation remains one of the poorest in the world, with more than half its 25 million citizens living below the poverty line. Furthermore, the rise in global food prices has affected more than 2.5 million Afghans, who can no longer afford to buy staples such as wheat flour.</p>

<p>Since 2002, more than 5 million Afghans have gone back home, with a large proportion returning to the eastern provinces. The returnees face huge challenges, such as insecurity, food shortages, insufficient shelter, unemployment and a lack of access to basic services.</p>

<p>UNHCR and WFP are working in partnership to help returnees in Afghanistan to rebuild their lives, particularly in the east. Programmes such as skills training, micro hydroelectricity projects and food distribution have helped Afghans get back on their feet and work towards creating sustainable livelihoods.</p>

</h2><p><em>In the six months since some 150 families returned from Pakistan's Jalozai refugee village, they have faced land problems and ethnic tensions. Today, however, they face the prospect of spending a bitter winter in northern Afghanistan with little more for shelter than canvas tents.</em></p>
<p>After 23 years of exile in Pakistan, Qayum and his family returned home to northern Afghanistan earlier this year ago after negotiating to buy land in Sholgara district. But a local tribe refused to let Qayum and his neighbours unload their trucks. The provincial authorities moved them to their current site at Mohajir Qeshlaq. The government has promised Qayum and his neighbours land, but until individual plots can be demarcated and distributed, nobody can build. This means that the entire returnee village - some 150 families - lives under canvas. As the weather turns cold, the prospect of spending an Afghan winter in a tent becomes reality. Returnees also face a food shortage, insufficient water and lack of livelihood opportunities.</p>
<p>In an effort to help, UNHCR will provide supplies to Qayum and his community through the winter. Once the land issue is resolved, the agency will also dig wells and provide shelter assistance to the most vulnerable families at Mohajir Qeshlaq. But it will take more to turn this makeshift settlement into something they can call home.</p>

</h2><p>See Afghanistan through the eyes of a returning refugee as Afghan photographer Zalma&iuml; revisits his homeland after more than 20 years in exile. 
<p>&quot;My project tries to capture the determination and the courage of a people that has rarely known peace, their optimism against all odds, and their worry that Afghanistan could still return to the nightmarish condition it is trying to escape,&quot; says Zalma&iuml;.
<p>In addition to the emotional journey, this exhibition also marked an aesthetic milestone for the photographer. &quot;I felt that now, after such a long time, there was hope again for Afghanistan. It seemed to me that colours were returning and that they would be those of a peaceful country. And so I set out to find this hope, with &#150; for the first time &#150; colour film in my camera.&quot;
<p>Take a peep into this kaleidoscope of Zalma&iuml;'s Afghanistan.

</h4></div><div class="rightComponent"><div class="inlineGBlurb hidTag" id="inlineGBlurb-4a1155d96"><h2>Afghanistan: An Uncertain Future</h2><p>For over a quarter of a century, Afghanistan has been devastated by conflict and civil strife, with some 8 million people uprooted internally and in neighbouring countries. The overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 resulted in one of the largest and most successful return operations in history.</p>
<p>Seven years on, more than 5 million Afghan refugees have returned - increasing Afghanistan's population by an estimated 20 percent.The large majority have gone back to their areas of origin. However, some recent returnees are facing more difficulties as the country's absorption capacity reaches its limits in some areas. Last year, some Afghans returned before they were ready or able to successfully reintegrate due to the closure of refugee villages as well as the deteriorating conditions in Pakistan. In consequence, 30,000 Afghan refugees returned to further displacement in their homeland, unable to return to their villages due to conflict, lack of land, shelter materials, basic services and job opportunities. These challenges have been compounded elsewhere across the country by food insecurity and severe drought.</p>
<p>UNHCR and the Afghan Foreign Ministry highlighted the requirements for sustainable refugee return and reintegration at an international conference in Kabul in November 2008. The donor community welcomed the inclusion of refugee reintegration within the government's five-year national development strategy and the emphasis on land, shelter, water, sanitation, education, health care and livelihoods. It is anticipated that repatriation and reintegration will become more challenging in future.</p>

During a 10-day trip, the best-selling author visited UNHCR projects and met returnees in the northern provinces of Kunduz, Baghlan, Balkh, Parwan and Kabul. Hosseini, a former Afghan refugee now settled in the United States, noted that it would take time and effort for Afghanistan to provide returnees with adequate infrastructure and services. He urged the international community to remain committed to Afghanistan and to give the country time. Hosseini could not visit the south and parts of the east, where insecurity is impacting on the ability of UNHCR to assess needs and provide assistance to those who need it the most. Since 2003, UNHCR has helped more than 4 million refugees return to Afghanistan. This year, some 300,000 Afghan refugees have returned from Pakistan. More than 900,000 remain in Iran and 2 million in Pakistan.</p>

On her second trip to the country, the acclaimed actress called for greater focus to be put on the reintegration of former refugees. More than 5.5 million refugees have returned since 2002, mainly from Pakistan and Iran, and now make up 20 per cent of the population. UNHCR is concerned that too many of these refugees continue to live without jobs, shelter and other basic needs.</p>
<p>Jolie caught up with several families she had met in 2008, still living in a dilapidated warehouse in Kabul. She was moved to see the families struggling to survive in the cold damp building. Children spend their days washing cars for money instead of attending school; the old and sick told Jolie of their pain to be such a burden on the young.</p>
<p>The actress also visited returned refugees living on the Alice Ghan and Barikab land allocation schemes north of Kabul. The returnees told her they were grateful for their houses but needed help with livelihoods. Jolie also visited Qala Gadu village, where she is funding the construction of a girls' primary school.</p>

Lack of land, job opportunities and other services, combined with poor security in some places, has caused many returnees to head to urban areas. While cities offer the promise of informal day labour, the rising cost of rental accommodation and basic commodities relegate many returnees to life in one of the informal settlements which have mushroomed across Kabul in recent years. Some families are living under canvases and the constant threat of eviction, while others have gained a toe-hold in abandoned buildings around the city.</p>
<p>UNHCR gives humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable, and is currently rallying support from donors and humanitarian and development agencies to redouble efforts to help returning refugees reintegrate in Afghanistan.</p>

The plan, drawn up between Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and UNHCR, aims to support repatriation, sustainable reintegration and assistance to host countries.</p>
<p>It will benefit refugee returnees to Afghanistan as well as 3 million Afghan refugees, including 1 million in Iran and 1.7 million in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Many of the refugees in Iran have been living there for more than three decades. This photo set captures the lives of some of these exiles, who wait in hope of a lasting solution to their situation.</p>

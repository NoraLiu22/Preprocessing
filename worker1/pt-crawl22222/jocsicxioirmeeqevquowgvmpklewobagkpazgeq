					<p class="lead">Category 2 Centres under the auspices of UNESCO related to World Heritage</p>
<p>In recent years, the framework for training and research in the field of World Heritage has changed significantly. Among the factors that have contributed to these rapid changes, is the emerging of many new institutions now offering capacity building within the World Heritage context. In this regard, a major development was the establishment, in various regions of the world, of capacity building institutions that have been granted the status of "<a href="http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=47720&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html">category 2 centres under the auspices of UNESCO</a>", dealing specifically with World Heritage.</p>
<p>These organizations are not legally part of the Organization, but are associated with it through formal arrangements approved by the General Conference and are committed to engage in support of UNESCO's strategic programme objectives (in this case support for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention). They are funded directly by Member States where they are located, but their scope goes beyond the boundaries of their country. Some are regional in scope while others cover more than one region or are organized around a thematic issue. Many are involved in capacity building and research, while some are set up as foundations or funds to support activities carried out by other organizations.</p>
<h2>Where are they? What do they do?</h2>

<h2>How do they coordinate with the World Heritage Centre and among them?</h2>
<p class="lead">The Category 2 Centres related to World Heritage work under a very comprehensive strategic framework and in a coordinated manner.</p>
<p>Their activities are expected to contribute to the World Heritage Strategy for Capacity Building as well as to the policies and programmes agreed by the governing bodies of the Convention, that is the General Assembly of the States Parties and the World Heritage Committee. They are in constant touch with the World Heritage Centre and take part in numerous initiatives and programmes related to World Heritage, notably in the process of the Periodic Reporting.</p>
<p>World Heritage Category 2 Centres also meet regularly among themselves to share their experiences and harmonize their activities.</p>
<h3>Coordination Meetings</h3>

<li><u>Commends</u> the progress made by the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, the Advisory Bodies, the States Parties, the category 2 centres under the auspices of UNESCO related to World Heritage, as well as the UNESCO Chairs with the implementation of the World Heritage Capacity-Building Strategy (WHCBS), and notably the efforts to maintain and adapt capacity-building activities during the global COVID-19 pandemic;</li>
<li><u>Takes note</u> of the progress made with the implementation of the regional and thematic capacity-building strategies and initiatives, the role of the regional category 2 centre in supporting the implementation of the Regional Action Plan for Africa (2021-2027) and <u>calls upon</u> States Parties and all concerned partners and stakeholders, including the Advisory Bodies (ICCROM, ICOMOS and IUCN), to support and follow up on the implementation of the strategies and initiatives developed for each regional and thematic area;</li>
<li><u>Thanks</u> the Governments of Norway, the Republic of Korea, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Switzerland for the continued financial support they extended to the WHCBS and the World Heritage Leadership Programme, <u>also thanks</u> the States Parties of the People’s Republic of China, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, France and the Sultanate of Oman for supporting World Heritage capacity-building activities, notably in the Africa region, and <u>further thanks</u> those States Parties who have contributed to the African World Heritage Fund, including Norway, South Africa, Uganda, Mauritius, Namibia, Germany, Burkina Faso, Azerbaijan, Serbia, France, United Arab Emirates and Rwanda;</li>
<li><u>Encourages</u> States Parties and other stakeholders to continue supporting the implementation of the WHCBS by providing financial support and/or reinforcing the human resources of the institutions involved;</li>
<li><u>Recalls</u> that category 2 centres and UNESCO Chairs have the mandate of contributing to the implementation of the Organization’s strategic priorities, programmes and global development agendas, notably through capacity building, <u>welcomes</u> the progress made by category 2 centres and UNESCO Chairs in the field of World Heritage, and <u>encourages</u> States Parties to make full use of the services and resources that category 2 centres and UNESCO Chairs provide, in a spirit of international cooperation;</li>
<li><u>Commends</u> the organisation of the 8th Coordination Meeting of the World Heritage-related category 2 centres, hosted by the International Centre for the Interpretation and Presentation of World Heritage Sites (Republic of Korea), <u>takes note</u> of the “Sejong Declaration of Understanding and Cooperation among UNESCO Category 2 World Heritage Centres” adopted on this occasion, and <u>notes with thanks</u> that the Regional World Heritage Institute in Zacatecas (Mexico) has expressed its intention to organise the 9th edition of the Coordination Meeting;</li>
<li><u>Expresses again its gratitude</u> to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for providing the financial support required to carry out the independent evaluation of the WHCBS;</li>
<li><u>Takes note</u> of the independent evaluation of the WHCBS, initiated through cooperation between UNESCO, ICCROM, IUCN and ICOMOS and carried out by the E.C.O. Institute for Ecology, and <u>endorses</u> its conclusions and recommendations;</li>

<li><u>Invites</u> all States Parties to provide dedicated voluntary contributions under the World Heritage Fund and/or extra-budgetary support to the World Heritage Centre for capacity building, since the Evaluation has further demonstrated the need to enhance capacity building and highlighted the lack of dedicated funding for capacity-building activities under the World Heritage Fund thus far;</li>
<li><u>Reiterates its appeal</u> to States Parties to contribute financial resources for the update of the WHCBS through earmarked contributions to the World Heritage Fund or by providing extra-budgetary support to the World Heritage Centre and the World Heritage-related category 2 centres for this purpose;</li>
<li><u>Requests</u> the World Heritage Centre, in cooperation with ICCROM, IUCN and ICOMOS, to develop a new World Heritage Capacity-Building Strategy for the decade 2025-2035, including clear priorities, strategic objectives, expected outputs and outcomes, relying on the outcomes of the independent evaluation of the WHCBS and the guidelines developed by the Evaluators for this purpose, and taking into account the results of the Periodic Reporting process, to be presented for review at its 47th session, if funding allows;</li>
<li><u>Further</u><u> requests</u> the World Heritage Centre and ICCROM to submit a progress report on the World Heritage-related capacity building activities and the revision of the WHCBS, for examination at its 46th session;</li>
<li><u>Mindful</u> that contributions by category 2 centres to the implementation of the World Heritage Convention are not confined to capacity building, <u>finally requests</u> the category 2 centres to submit a progress report on all the activities concerning the implementation of the World Heritage Convention by the World Heritage-related category 2 centres, presented as a specific agenda item during the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee.</li>

<li><u>Expresses its concern</u> over the challenges faced by the States Parties in the protection and conservation of World Heritage properties in the face of increased global economic, social, digital and environmental challenges, as well as the need to strengthen national and local capacities through enhanced knowledge exchange, capacity-building and training of current and future national and local officials in heritage conservation and management;</li>

<li><u>Also takes note</u> of the 10-year anniversary of the WHCBS in 2021 and, <u>further recalling</u> its request for an evaluation of the WHCBS, <u>notes</u> that no funding has been made available for this purpose to date, and therefore <u>will consider</u> reallocating USD 30,000 as seed money from the World Heritage Fund under item 14 of the agenda, to initiate the evaluation and the creation of a new WHCBS;</li>
<li><u>R</u><u>equests</u> the World Heritage Centre and ICCROM, in cooperation with IUCN and ICOMOS, to submit an independent results-based evaluation of the outcomes of the WHCBS, based on close consultation and a participatory, transparent, and inclusive process with the States Parties and other capacity building stakeholders and beneficiaries, for examination at its 45th session;</li>

											<p><p>The World Heritage Committee,<br />1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Having examined</span> Documents WHC-14/38.COM/8B.Add and WHC-14/38.COM/INF.8B2.Add,<br />2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inscribes</span> the Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area, India, on the World Heritage List on the basis of criterion (x);<br />3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adopts</span> the following Statement of Outstanding Universal Value:<br /><br /><strong>Brief synthesis</strong><br />The Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area is located in the western part of the Himalayan Mountains in the northern Indian State of Himachal Pradesh. The 90,540 ha property includes the upper mountain glacial and snow melt water source origins of the westerly flowing Jiwa Nal, Sainj and Tirthan Rivers and the north-westerly flowing Parvati River which are all headwater tributaries to the River Beas and subsequently, the Indus River. The property includes an elevational range from high alpine peaks of over 6,000m a.s.l to riverine forest at altitudes below 2,000m a.s.l. The Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area encompasses the catchments of water supplies which are vital to millions of downstream users.<br /><br />The property lies within the ecologically distinct Western Himalayas at the junction between two of the world’s major biogeographic realms, the Palearctic and Indomalayan Realms. Displaying biotic elements from both these realms, the Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area protects the monsoon affected forests and alpine meadows of the Himalayan front ranges which sustain a unique biota comprised of many distinct altitude-sensitive ecosystems. The property is home to many plants and animals endemic to the region. The Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area displays distinct broadleaf and conifer forest types forming mosaics of habitat across steep valley side landscapes. It is a compact, natural and biodiverse protected area system that includes 25 forest types and an associated rich assemblage of fauna species.<br /><br />The Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area is at the core of a larger area of surrounding protected areas which form an island of undisturbed environments in the greater Western Himalayan landscape. The diversity of species present is rich; however it is the abundance and health of individual species’ populations supported by healthy ecosystem processes where the Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area demonstrates its outstanding significance for biodiversity conservation.<br /><br /><strong>Criterion (x):</strong> The Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area is located within the globally significant “Western Himalayan Temperate Forests” ecoregion. The property also protects part of Conservation International’s Himalaya “biodiversity hot spot” and is part of the BirdLife International’s Western Himalaya Endemic Bird Area. The Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area is home to 805 vascular plant species, 192 species of lichen, 12 species of liverworts and 25 species of mosses. Some 58% of its angiosperms are endemic to the Western Himalayas. The property also protects some 31 species of mammals, 209 birds, 9 amphibians, 12 reptiles and 125 insects. The Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area provides habitat for 4 globally threatened mammals, 3 globally threatened birds and a large number of medicinal plants. The protection of lower altitude valleys provides for more complete protection and management of important habitats and endangered species such as the Western Tragopan and the Musk Deer. <br /><br /><strong>Integrity</strong><br />The property is of a sufficient size to ensure the natural functioning of ecological processes. Its rugged topography and inaccessibility together with its location within a much larger ecological complex of protected areas ensures its integrity. The altitudinal range within the property together with its diversity of habitat types provide a buffer to climate change impacts and the needs of altitude sensitive plants and animals to find refuge from climate variability.<br /><br />A 26,560 ha buffer zone known as an Ecozone is defined along the south-western side of the property. This buffer zone coincides with the areas of greatest human pressure and is managed in sympathy with the core values of the Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area. The property is further buffered by high mountain systems to the north-west which include several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. These areas also offer scope to progressively increase the size of the World Heritage property.<br /><br />Human settlement related threats pose the greatest concern and include agriculture, localised poaching, traditional grazing, human-wildlife conflicts and hydropower development. Tourism impact is minimal and trekking routes are closely regulated. <br /><br /><strong>Protection and management requirements</strong> <br />The property is subject to sound legal protection, however, this needs to be strengthened to ensure consistent high level protection across all areas. Tirthan and Sainj Wildlife Sanctuaries are designated in recognition of their ecological and zoological significance and are subject to wildlife management objectives, and a higher level of strict protection is provided to Great Himalayan National Park which is a national park. National parks under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 provide for strict protection without human disturbance. <br /><br />The property’s boundaries are considered appropriate and an effective management regime is in place including an overall management plan and adequate resourcing. The property has a buffer zone along its south-western side which corresponds to the 26,560 ha Ecozone, the area of greatest human population pressure. Continued attention is required to manage sensitive community development issues in this buffer zone and in some parts of the property itself. <br /><br />The sensitive resolution of access and use rights by communities is needed to bolster protection as is fostering alternative livelihoods which are sympathetic to the conservation of the area. Local communities are engaged in management decisions; however more work is needed to fully empower communities and continue to build a strong sense of support and stewardship for the Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area.<br /><br />Included within the property is the Sainj Wildlife Sanctuary with 120 inhabitants and the Tirthan Wildlife Sanctuary, which is uninhabited but currently subject to traditional grazing. The inclusion of these two Wildlife Sanctuaries supports the integrity of the nomination; however, it opens up concerns regarding the impacts of grazing and human settlements. Both these aspects are being actively managed, a process that will need to be maintained. The extent and impacts of high pasture grazing in the Tirthan area of the property needs to be assessed and grazing phased out as soon as practicable. Other impacts arising from small human settlements within the Sainj area of the property also need to be addressed as soon as practicable.</p>
<p><br />4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requests</span> the State Party to:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">a) expedite, in accordance with legislated processes, the resolution of community rights based issues with respect to local communities and indigenous peoples in the Tirthan and Sainj Wildlife Sanctuaries, including in relation to the phasing out of grazing in the Tirthan Wildlife Sanctuary,</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">b) continue, in consultation with communities and stakeholders, longer term plans to progressively increase the size of the property, in order to increase integrity and better provide for the conservation of wide-ranging species, through extensions of other surrounding protected areas potentially including the Rupi Bhabha Wildlife Sanctuary, Pin Valley National Park, Khirganga National Park and the Kanawar Wildlife Sanctuary;</div>
5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commends</span> the State Party and the range of stakeholders in the nominated property for their efficient and effective action to address concerns related to the property’s integrity, protection and management, as previously raised by the World Heritage Committee;<br />6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommends</span> the States Parties to consider undertaking a regional comparative study with the possible support of the IUCN, other partners such as the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and the newly established UNESCO Category 2 Centre on World Natural Heritage Management and Training for Asia-Pacific Region in India to assess the scope of ecosystems within the Himalayas and adjacent mountain regions with a view to identifying potential World Heritage candidate areas and boundary configurations in this region, including potential serial nominations / extensions;<br />7. Requests the State Party of India to submit to the World Heritage Centre by 1 December 2015, a report, including a 1-page executive summary, on the state of conservation of the property, including confirmation of progress on the above-mentioned requests, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 40th session in 2016.</p>

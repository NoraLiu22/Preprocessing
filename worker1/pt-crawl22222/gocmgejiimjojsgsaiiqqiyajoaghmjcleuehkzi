                    The bones of an early member of our species, Homo sapiens, 
                    known as Omo I, excavated from Ethiopia's Kibish rock formation. 
                    The bones are kept in the National Museum of Ethiopia. When 
                    the first bones from Omo I were found in 1967, they were thought 
                    to be 130,000 years old. Later, 160,000-year-old bones of 
                    our species were found elsewhere. Now, a new study by scientists 
                    from the University of Utah and elsewhere determined that 
                    Omo I lived about 195,000 years ago -- the oldest known bones

                    humans in 1967 and estimated they were 130,000 years old. 
                    But in a new study in the journal Nature, scientists from 
                    Utah, New York state and Australia determined those bones 
                    and newly excavated fossils actually were from members of 
                    our species who roamed the area 195,000 years ago. They are 
                    the oldest known fossils of Homo sapiens.<br>

                    found in Ethiopia's Kibish formation. The bottom piece was

              <p align="left"> Feb. 16, 2005 &#8211; When the bones of two early 
                humans were found in 1967 near Kibish, Ethiopia, they were thought 
                to be 130,000 years old. A few years ago, researchers found 154,000- 
                to 160,000-year-old human bones at Herto, Ethiopia. Now, a new 
                study of the 1967 fossil site indicates the earliest known members 
                of our species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, roamed Africa about 195,000 
                years ago.<br>
                <br>
                &#8220;It pushes back the beginning of anatomically modern humans,&#8221; 
                says geologist Frank Brown, a co-author of the study and dean 
                of the University of Utah&#8217;s College of Mines and Earth Sciences.<br>
                <br>
                The journal <em>Nature</em> is publishing the study in its Thursday 
                Feb. 17, 2005, issue. Brown conducted the research with geologist 
                and geochronologist Ian McDougall of Australian National University 
                in Canberra, and anthropologist John Fleagle of New York state&#8217;s 
                Stony Brook University.<br>
                <br>
                The researchers dated mineral crystals in volcanic ash layers 
                above and below layers of river sediments that contain the early 
                human bones. They conclude the fossils are much older than a 104,000-year-old 
                volcanic layer and very close in age to a 196,000-year-old layer, 
                says Brown. <br>
                <br>
                &#8220;These are the oldest well-dated fossils of modern humans 
                (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) currently known anywhere in the world,&#8221; 
                the scientists say in a summary of the study.</p>
              <p><strong>Significance of an Earlier Emergence of <em>Homo sapiens</em></strong><br>
                <br>
                Brown says that pushing the emergence of <em>Homo sapiens</em> 
                from about 160,000 years ago back to about 195,000 years ago &#8220;is 
                significant because the cultural aspects of humanity in most cases 
                appear much later in the record &#8211; only 50,000 years ago 
                &#8211; which would mean 150,000 years of <em>Homo sapiens</em> 
                without cultural stuff, such as evidence of eating fish, of harpoons, 
                anything to do with music (flutes and that sort of thing), needles, 
                even tools. This stuff all comes in very late, except for stone 
                knife blades, which appeared between 50,000 and 200,000 years 
                ago, depending on whom you believe.&#8221;<br>
                <br>
                Fleagle adds: &#8220;There is a huge debate in the archeological 
                literature regarding the first appearance of modern aspects of 
                behavior such as bone carving for religious reasons, or tools 
                (harpoons and things), ornamentation (bead jewelry and such), 
                drawn images, arrowheads. They only appear as a coherent package 
                about 50,000 years ago, and the first modern humans that left 
                Africa between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago seem to have had the 
                full set. As modern human anatomy is documented at earlier and 
                earlier sites, it becomes evident that there was a great time 
                gap between the appearance of the modern skeleton and &#8216;modern 
                behavior.&#8217;&#8221;<br>
                <br>
                The study moves the date of human skulls found in Ethiopia&#8217;s 
                Kibish rock formation in 1967 back from 130,000 years to a newly 
                determined date of 195,000 years ago, give or take 5,000 years. 
                Fossils from an individual known as Omo I look like bones of modern 
                humans, but other bones are from a more primitive cousin named 
                Omo II.<br>
                <br>
                In addition to the cultural question, the earlier date for humanity&#8217;s 
                emergence is important for other reasons.<br>
                <br>
                &#8220;First, it makes the dates in the fossil record almost exactly 
                concordant with the dates suggested by genetic studies for the 
                origin of our species,&#8221; Fleagle says. &#8220;Second, it 
                places the first appearance of modern <em>Homo sapiens</em> in 
                Africa many more thousands of years before our species appears 
                on any other continent. It lengthens that gap. &#8230; Finally, 
                the similar dating of the two skulls indicates that when modern 
                humans first appeared there were other contemporary populations 
                [Omo II] that were less modern.&#8221;<br>
                <br>
                The study was funded by the National Science Foundation, the L. 
                S. B. Leakey Foundation, the National Geographic Society and the 
                Australian National University.</p>
              <p><strong>Modern Homo in the Valley of the Omo</strong><br>
                <br>
                Richard Leakey and his team of paleontologists traveled in 1967 
                to the Kibish Formation along the Omo River in southernmost Ethiopia, 
                near the town of Kibish. They found the skull (minus the face) 
                and partial skeleton (parts of arms, legs, feet and the pelvis) 
                of Omo I, and the top and back of the skull of Omo II. Brown was 
                not part of the 1967 expedition, but was working nearby and got 
                to look at the site and the fossils.<br>
                <br>
                &#8220;Anthropologists said they looked very different in their 
                evolutionary status,&#8221; Brown recalls. &#8220;Omo I appeared 
                to be essentially modern <em>Homo sapiens</em>, and Omo II appeared 
                to be more primitive.&#8221;<br>
                <br>
                In 1967, the fossils were dated as being 130,000 years old, although 
                the scientists doubted the accuracy of their dating technique, 
                which was based on the decay of uranium-238 to thorium-238 in 
                oyster shells from a rock layer near the skulls.<br>

                Fleagle says no scientist has been bold enough to suggest Omo 
                II is anything other than <em>Homo sapiens</em>, and that &#8220;quite 
                often at the time of major events in evolution, one finds an increase 
                in morphological [anatomical] diversity.&#8221; Now that the new 
                study confirms Omo I and Omo II are the same age &#8211; living 
                within a few hundred years of each other about 195,000 years ago 
                &#8211; some anthropologist suggest &#8220;maybe it [Omo II] isn&#8217;t 
                so primitive after all,&#8221; Brown says.<br>
                <br>
                McDougall, Brown and Fleagle and researchers from other universities 
                returned to Kibish in 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2003. They identified 
                sites where Omo I and Omo II were found in 1967, and obtained 
                more of Omo I, including part of the femur (upper leg bone) that 
                fit a piece found in 1967. They also found animal fossils and 
                stone tools, and studied local geology. The <em>Nature</em> study 
                includes initial results from those expeditions.<br>
                <br>
                The fossil record of human ancestors may go back 6 million years 
                or more, and the genus <em>Homo</em> arose at least 1.8 million 
                years ago when australopithecines evolved into human ancestors 
                known as <em>Homo habilis</em>. Brown says the fossil record of 
                humans is poor from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago, so Omo I is 
                significant because it now is well dated.</p>
              <p><strong>Dating the Dawn of Humanity</strong><br>
                <br>
                Both Omo I and Omo II were buried in the lowermost portion or 
                &#8220;member&#8221; of the Kibish Formation, a series of annual 
                flood sediments laid down rapidly by the ancient Omo River on 
                the delta where it once entered Lake Turkana. Lake levels now 
                are much lower, and the river enters the lake about 60 miles (100 
                kilometers) south of Kibish.<br>
                <br>
                The 330-foot-thick (100-meter-thick) formation is divided into 
                at least four members, with each of the four sets of layers separated 
                from the other by an &#8220;unconformity,&#8221; which represents 
                a period of time when rock eroded away instead of being deposited. 
                For example, the lowermost Kibish I member was deposited in layers 
                as the Omo River flooded each year. After thousands of years, 
                rainfall diminished, lake levels dropped, and the upper part of 
                Kibish I eroded away. Later, the lake rose and deposition resumed 
                to create layers of Kibish member II.<br>
                <br>
                Interspersed among the river sediments are occasional layers of 
                volcanic ash from ancient eruptions of nearby volcanoes. Some 
                ash layers contain chunks of pumice, which in turn contain feldspar 
                mineral crystals. Feldspar has small amounts of radioactive potassium-40, 
                which decays into argon-40 gas at a known rate. The gas, trapped 
                inside feldspar crystals, allows scientists to date the feldspar 
                and the pumice and ash encasing it.<br>
                <br>
                Brown says potassium-argon dating shows that a layer of ash no 
                more than 10 feet (3 meters) below Omo I&#8217;s and Omo II&#8217;s 
                burial place is 196,000 years old, give or take 2,000 years. Another 
                layer is 104,000 years old. It is almost 160 feet (50 meters) 
                above the layer that yielded the Omo humans. The unconformities 
                represent periods of time when rock was eroded, so the fossils 
                must be much older than the 104,000-year-old layer and close in 
                age to the 196,000-year-old layer, Brown says.<br>
                <br>
                The clinching evidence, he says, comes from sapropels, which are 
                dark rock layers on the Mediterranean seafloor that were deposited 
                when floods of fresh water poured out of the Nile River during 
                rainy times. The Blue Nile and White Nile tributaries share a 
                drainage divide with the Omo River. During ancient wet periods, 
                monsoons on the Ethiopian highlands sent annual floods surging 
                down the Nile system, causing sapropels to form on the seafloor, 
                and sent floods down the Omo, making Lake Turkana rise and depositing 
                Kibish Formation sediments on the river&#8217;s ancient delta. 
                (During dry periods, Lake Turkana was smaller, flood sediments 
                were deposited farther south and rocks at Kibish were eroded.) 
                <br>
                <br>
                No other sediments on land have been found to record wet and dry 
                periods that correlate so well with the same climate pattern in 
                ocean sediments, Brown says. The new study found that the &#8220;members&#8221; 
                &#8211; or groups of rock layers &#8211; of the Kibish formation 
                were laid down at the same time as the Mediterranean sapropels. 
                In particular, the volcanic layer right beneath Omo I and II dates 
                to 196,000 years ago by potassium-argon dating, and it corresponds 
                almost perfectly to a sapropel layer previously dated as 195,000 
                years old, Brown says.<br>
                <br>
                &#8220;It is pretty conclusive,&#8221; says Brown, who disputes 
                any contention that the fossils might be closer to 104,000 years 
                old.<br>

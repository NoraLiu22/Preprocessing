<h1>The Real Prince Philip.</h1>
		
<p><i>'He looked like a sort of young Viking, very blond and strong and very handsome. 
  Oh, I think he was everybody's heart-throb'.<br>
        </i>Lady Kennard, cousin to Prince Philip.</p>
						
      <p>The public perception of Prince Philip today tends to be that of an arrogant, 
        cantankerous elderly man suffering from a severe case of foot-in-mouth 
        disease. Yet is this troubled picture a true reflection of the man who 
        always has to walk two steps behind the queen?</p>
						<p>The makers of the two-part Channel 4 special <i>The Real Prince Philip</i> had unique access to royal intimates and friends and rarely seen documentary footage from the royal archive. The programmes illuminated our knowledge of one of the least understood members of the royal family and charted his life from princely refugee to debonair naval officer and from modernising royal to arch traditionalist.</p>
						
      <p>The programmes included interviews with childhood friends (and cousins) 
        Lady Mountbatten, Lady Kennard and Lady Butter, as well as: Michael Parker, 
        Philip's private secretary from 1947 to 1957; Constantine II, former king 
        of Greece; John Gibson, former royal footman; naval contemporaries Lord 
        Lewin and Admiral William O'Brien; Charles de Haes, former Director of 
        the World Wildlife Fund (now the World Wide Fund for Nature); and Martin 
        Palmer, Prince Philip's religious adviser.</p>
      <p><i>The Real Prince Philip</i> also included footage from the ground-breaking 
        television programme <i>Royal Family,</i> seen for the first time since 
        its broadcast in 1969.</p>
						
      
<p><b>1921-1952.</b></p>
						<p>In 1921, Philip was born on Corfu into the atmosphere of extreme uncertainty and danger that shrouded the Greek royal family. At the age of 18 months, he was carried aboard a Royal Navy ship in an orange box as his family fled the military junta that had overthrown the Greek monarchy following the country's defeat at the hands of the Turks. From then on, Philip had a rootless existence, drifting between the minor royal households of Europe. His mother, Princess Alice, sister of Louis Mountbatten, became increasingly estranged from Philip's father Prince Andrew and the two eventually separated. Alice retreated to a nunnery and Andrew to Monte Carlo, where he died in the arms of his mistress. Philip's inheritance was an ivory-handled shaving brush and a few moth-eaten suits.</p>
						<p>Yet Philip appeared to thrive. He was educated at Cheam and at the German public school Salem, and when the latter's Jewish headmaster Kurt Hahn fled Nazi persecution, Philip followed him to the new public school he set up in Scotland &#150; Gordonstoun.</p>
						<p>In 1939, Philip joined the Royal Navy, and it was at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth that he met the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth. Marion Crawford, Elizabeth's governess, remembered that first meeting: 'A fair-haired boy, rather like a Viking with a sharp face and piercing blue eyes, came in. He was good looking, though rather off-hand in his manner. Lillibet never took her eyes off him the whole time.'</p>
						
      <p>Philip's uncle and godfather Lord Louis Mountbatten had organised the 
        royal visit to Dartmouth and for Philip to escort the young princess. 
        Lillibet did not forget her 'Viking', but although Mountbatten continued 
        over the next few years to fight the corner of his young protege, the 
        path to a royal romance was strewn with obstacles, including the Second 
        World War. Philip himself had a 'good' war, serving in the Mediterranean 
        &#150; when he took part in the battle of Matapan &#150; and in the Pacific. 
        However, by the time he married Elizabeth in 1947, he had had to distance 
        himself from his own sisters, one of whom was married to a prominent Nazi, 
        renounce his religion and his nationality, and even change his name: Philip 
        Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg became Philip Mountbatten.</p>
						<p>However, the marriage seemed happy, and never more than during Philip and Elizabeth's tour of Kenya in 1952. This was brought to a halt by the unexpected death of George VI and Elizabeth's sudden accession to the throne. At that moment, Philip stopped being his own man and became subservient to his wife. It was a transition he found hard to make. </p>
						
<p><b>1952 to the present.</b></p>
						
      <p>In the 1950s, rumours of affairs and problems in the royal marriage swept 
        the international press, yet the prince kept busy &#150; in 1956, he founded 
        the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme to encourage creative achievement 
        among young people &#150; and scandal was avoided. In 1969 came the royal 
        family's first attempt at modern spin-doctoring with the television documentary 
        <i>Royal Family</i>: its making was championed by Philip who wanted to 
        portray the Windsors as an ordinary family doing an extraordinary job.</p>
						
      <p>However, his role as President of the World Wildlife Fund was tinged 
        with controversy, owing to his penchant for shooting wildlife. Then there 
        was his unfortunate knack of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time 
        &#150; including the infamous 'slitty eyes' comment on a royal tour of 
        China. In later life, he has journeyed back to Greek Orthodoxy. The programme 
        ended with the question: why has the man who brought a modernising breath 
        of fresh air to Buckingham Palace in the early days of his marriage apparently 
        become a reactionary traditionalist? </p>
						<p><i>The Real Prince Philip</i> revealed the life of a royal paradox; the man who is at the centre of the British monarchy but who can never play a part in the nation's constitutional life. </p>

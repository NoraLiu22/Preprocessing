				<h2>The K'atun Histories and Period-ending Rites of the Temple of Inscriptions</h2>
				<p class="image-caption"><img src="/web/20060901074300im_/http://learningobjects.wesleyan.edu/palenque/images/structures/temple_inscriptions/image01_texts.jpg" alt="Tablets from the temple of Inscriptions" width="510" height="140"/><br/>
				From left: East Tablet (<a href="javascript:popup('../../zoomify/inscriptions_east_schele.html')">magnify</a>),
				Center table <a href="javascript:popup('../../zoomify/inscriptions_center_schele.html')">(magnify</a>),
				and West tablet (<a href="javascript:popup('../../zoomify/inscriptions_west_schele.html')">magnify</a>)
				from the Temple of Inscriptions. </p>
				<p>Linda Schele succinctly described the general themes and structure of
					the Temple of Inscriptions texts in the opening to her 1986 <i>Notebook for
						the Maya Hieroglyphic Writing Workshop at Texas</i> (Schele and Wald 1999:12).
				</p>
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The inscriptions of the first two and one third of the panels of the
						Temple of Inscriptions are composed of the histories of the Katun 4 through
						Katun 13, and in many ways these inscriptions can be considered the proto-type
						of the katun histories as they are known in the books of the Chilam Balam
						of Yucatan. These particular katuns seem to have been chosen because they
						form the number nine which can be divided in sections of three each, and,
						therefore, provide the locking dates of the inscription of the sarcophagus
						sides at the one-third intervals, or at 9.7.0.0.0 and 9.10.0.0.0. </p>
					<p> The katun histories themselves are recorded in very restricted formulas
						which can be described in terms of the following three types: (1) those
						katuns [katun 4-8] which lead up to the katun in which Pacal, the builder
						of the temple, was born; (2) the katun of his mother's reign, and the three
						katun endings of his own reign; and, (3) those katuns and other period
						endings which fall in the future after the construction of the temple and
					the design of the inscriptions. </p>
				</blockquote>
				<p> Since Schele's above observations the Temple of Inscriptions narrative
					has received surprisingly little scholarly investigation. This is especially
					perplexing considering its great length and obvious importance for
					understanding Palenque's history. Exceptions to this trend include the Notebooks
					of the annual Maya Meetings at the University of Texas, Austin (cf. Schele
					and Wald 1999; Martin et al. 2002), Schele and Mathews' (1998) recent general
					book on Maya ruins that includes a chapter on the Temple of Inscriptions
					and highlights, however briefly, the ritual actions that are clearly
					the central focus of the narrative. Martin and Grube (2000; Martin et al.
					2002), looking again at the historical information of the text, make heavy
					use of the Temple of Inscription texts in their outline of Palenque's history.
					Nevertheless, despite these enlightening studies few attempts have
					been made to present a translation of major portions of the text or to underscore
					the poetic beauty of its structure (for exception see Hull 2003). In
					the following, I present a transcription, transliteration, and translation
					of the passages concerning the period ending rituals of the 10th-12th K'atuns,
					which covers the East Panel S8-T12 through the entire Middle Panel
					and A1-A8 of the West Panel. In the spring (2005) a PDF version will be
					available including arguments for particular glyphic readings and interpretations
				and additional contextual information.</p>

				<h2>Translation</h2>
				<p>The end of the 1 Ajaw K'atun was the first stone-seating of K'inich
					Janaab' Pakal, the Divine Palenque Lord. He gave the bundles of his gods. </p>
				<p> On his second stone-seating, 12 Ajaw 8 Keh was the 11th K'atun, <br/>
					the face-of-the-sky-maize-god had become lord, <br/>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; the face of the jewel/moon tree had sprouted, <br/>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the face of the &ldquo;Five origins&rdquo; tree had sprouted,<br/>
					<br/>
					the heavenly bundle, <br/>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; the earthly bundle, <br/>
					<br/>
					the necklace, <br/>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; the earspool<br/>
					<br/>
					&hellip;He is the B'olon Tz'akb'u Ajaw, [the Nine Successor Lord] <br/>
					<br/>
					It was the end of the 12 Ajaw K'atun, the Winikhaab' Ch'aho'm, K'ihnich
					Janaab' Pakal, the Divine Palenque Lord witnessed it. <br/>
					<br/>
					He gave the &#8220;Quadripartite badge,&#8221; it was headdress of the twenty bundles
					of Chaak. <br/>
					He gave Tziik, it was the headdress of the twenty bundles of the infant
					K'awiil. <br/>
					He gave white bark-paper, it was the headdress of the twenty bundles
					of the Sun Lord. <br/>
					<br/>
					The headdress-tying of the icons of the &ldquo;three ? gods,&rdquo; the Maize God,
					the Infant K'awiil, and the Fire God was the diligent service of K'ihnich
					Janaab' Pakal, the Divine Palenque Lord. <br/>
					<br/>
					It was his third stone-seating as the king of Palenque.<br/>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; 10 Ajaw 8 Yaxk'in was the 12th K'atun, <br/>
					<br/>
					K'ihnich Janaab' Pakal, the Divine Palenque Lord witnessed it. <br/>
					<br/>
					The face of Laju'n Ajaw became lord, <br/>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; it was the face of the final year. <br/>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dried became the face of the jewel/moon tree. <br/>
					<br/>
					Lost were the eastern lords, <br/>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the western lords. <br/>
					<br/>
					&#8230;He is the B'olon Tz'ab'u Ajaw, [the Nine Successor Lord] <br/>
					<br/>
					Tied again was the white bark-paper of the icon of his gods. <br/>
					<br/>
					He gave the divine bundle of [the deity Sak B'olon],<br/>
					twenty wrappings were its white bark-paper jewel, <br/>
					the first fire god was its earspool, <br/>
					the divine sacrificial bowl [quadripartite badge] was the headdress
					of Chaahk, Sak B'olon. <br/>
					<br/>
					The Winikhaab' Ch'aho'm Janaab' Pakal, the divine Palenque Lord gave
					[these bundles]. <br/>
					<br/>
					He gave the divine bundle of [the Infant K'awiil], <br/>
					twenty wrappings were its white bark-paper necklace, <br/>
					the first <i>jopoy</i> sky-face was its earspool, <br/>
					Divine veneration (<i>tziik?</i>) was the headdress of the sprout, <br/>
					the Infant K'awiil. <br/>
					<br/>
					He gave the bundle of [the K'inich Ajaw], <br/>
					twenty wrappings were its white bark-paper necklace, <br/>
					the first pa'k (?) was its earspool, <br/>
					the divine bark-paper was the headdress of the Lord of Fire, K'inich
					Ajaw, the three ? gods, Ju'n Ajaw. <br/>
					<br/>
					The Red House, the Red Skin Sky, the Six Skies was the shrine [oven]
					of the One-Grain-of-Maize Chaahk, the Sak B'olon, the thrice progenitor. <br/>
					<br/>
					The tying of the headband of the icons of his gods&#8212;the Maize God,
					the Infant K'awiil, and the Sun God&mdash;was the diligent service of the
					Winikhaab' Chaho'm K'ihnich Janaab' Pakal to his gods, [and thus by this]
					he appeased the heart his gods. </p>

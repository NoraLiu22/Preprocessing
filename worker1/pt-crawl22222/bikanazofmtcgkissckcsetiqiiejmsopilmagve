<p><strong>African cinema boasts a rich, exhilarating ferment  of styles and themes and major directing talents to rival those of any other  continent. How is it, then, that its masterworks are so hard to see in the  west, wonders Mark Cousins</strong></p>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld was half right. There's what we know we know,  and there's what we don't know we don't know. What he didn't say is that, in  between, there's what we (in the north) have heard of, what we know we should  know, but which remains penumbral. In this mental shadowland lies a world of  cinema: film-makers as significant as Martin Scorsese, as discrepant as Orson  Welles; imagery as mythic as that of Sergei Paradjanov or Nicolas Roeg; life  stories with the amplitude of Francis Ford Coppola's. These are films from a  continent three times the size of the US, with more than 50 countries,  over 1,000 languages, and nearly 300 film-makers in the Francophone territories  alone. Many of us know something about Ousmane Sembène or Djibril Diop Mambéty,  but their films don't become obsessions, something we rave about when drunk, or  need to own, or show to lovers, or give to friends. Should they? Let's see.</p>
<p>The northern hemisphere invented cinema  and set the ball rolling. East Asia ran with  it and from the 1930s gave it new pace and direction. Africa, however, didn't  get a decent touch until 1935 when the MISR film studio in Cairo became the first of its kind in the  African (or Arab) world. Its output was mostly formulaic comedies and musicals,  but films like Kamal Selim's <cite>The Will</cite> (1939) showed more serious potential. The Egyptian Youssef Chahine built on  that potential with the seminal <cite>Cairo  Station</cite> (1958) - polygeneric, prefiguring Hitchcock's <cite>Psycho</cite>, and laying the foundation stone for Arab film-making.  Fuelled by Nasserian socialism, Chahine was the first of Africa's  directors to see that the continent's cinema would be energised by  decolonisation. At the inaugural Carthage Film Festival in Tunisia in 1966  he declared that "freedom of expression is not given, it is taken", later  adding: "<cite>I'm</cite> the first world. I've  been here for 7,000 years." </p>
<p>New alliances forged at 1955's Bandung conference of African and Asian states in Indonesia and the wind of self-determination in Africa fanned the flames, and by the mid-1960s the idea  of indigenous African cinema had caught fire. Egypt  continued to have a functioning film industry and Algeria started making great work  like Ahmed Rachedi's <cite>Dawn of the Damned</cite> (1965), but it was in sub-Saharan Francophone Senegal that the promise burned  brightest. There, in 1965, three years before the first major American film  directed by a black person, African cinema's second artistic father-figure  emerged. Most of those who followed were born into educated middle-class  families, </p>
<p>but Ousmane Sembène started as a bricklayer, became a Citroën factory worker  and eventually a novelist. Like Chahine, he was angry, a Marxist who pointed  out in his seminal paper ‘Man Is Culture' that the word ‘art' doesn't exist in  any of the languages of West Africa. Such talk makes him sound didactic, but if  he's often accused of preaching, that's only because he has taken on most of  the big issues of his time. From 1966's <cite>La  Noire de...,</cite> through the hilarious <cite>Xala</cite> in 1974, Sembène tackled gender. In <cite>Camp  de Thiaroye </cite>(1988) he tracked the <cite>tirailleurs  senegalais</cite>, the black African troops who fought for French colonial armies. <cite>Ceddo</cite> was ballsy in 1976, but  consider its theme now: the arrival of Islam in 19th-century West   Africa. Like Euro-Christianity, it brings violence and forces  compliance; its advocates are fanatics, blind to cultural freedoms. The film  ends with the local Wolof princess shooting an imam. </p>
<p>Such range made Sembène not so much a  state-of-the-nation film-maker as a state-of-the-continent one, the John Ford  of Africa. In his monograph on Sembène, David  Murphy quotes Edward Said as saying that in his films we see "the  transformation from <cite>filiation</cite> to <cite>affiliation</cite>": the change in society from  blood relations to civic ones. Sembène's work is all about rethinking and  modernisation, and by the mid-1970s his voice had been joined by others. In Mauritania in  1970 Med Hondo had made <cite>Soleil O</cite>, the  first, greatest, incandescent film about African immigrants. Safi Faye's  feature debut, the first film by a black African woman, was the beautiful <cite>Letter from My Village</cite> (Senegal, 1975).  In the same year Algeria won  the Palme d'Or at Cannes  with Mohamed Lakhdar-Hamina's <cite>Chronicle  of the Years of Embers</cite>, shot on 70mm. Still in 1975, Hailé Gerima's  Godardian<cite> Harvest: 3,000 Years</cite> not  only put Ethiopia  on the film-making map but, with lines like "Is there anywhere in the world  where there are no flies or Europeans?", turned African cinema white hot.  Sembène had said, "You don't tell a story for revenge but to find your place in  the world", and now lots of African film-makers were doing so. </p>
<p>Those of us who were paying attention  found the pace of these debuts, the rich ferment of styles and themes,  exhilarating. Just as Scorsese, Coppola, Spielberg and Bogdanovich were  reinventing US  film, so Sembène, Hondo, Faye, Gerima and Lakhdar-Hamina were inventing African  cinema. </p>
<p>But to say so is to leave out  Senegalese man of the theatre-turned-director Djibril Diop Mambéty. Mambéty  drank like Sam Peckinpah and was as disinterested in polish and the niceties of  synch sound as Orson Welles. At the age of 28 he made a caustic road movie, <cite>Touki Bouki</cite> (1973), Africa's  equivalent of <cite>Easy Rider</cite> or <cite>A bout de souffle</cite>. Author of <cite>African Cinema</cite> Manthia Diawara wrote  that <cite>Touki Bouki</cite> "tears up the screen with fantasies of  African modernity never before seen in film" - and he was right. Mambéty, like  his polar-opposite Dakar visionary Sembène, was calling forth a  here-and-nowness for Africa, a cubist, layered modernity, a filiation untouched  by revenge but bustling with recovery. <cite>Touki  Bouki</cite> means "journey of the hyenas" and Mambéty saw the snarl of these  beasts as the greedy face of the World Bank. Scandalously, it would be 20 years  before he made his next feature, itself called <cite>Hyenas</cite>.</p>
<h3>Mythic dreamtime</h3>
<p>Even those who were following  this ferment of film form were unlikely to predict what happened in the 1980s.  Many African nations were forced to mortgage their economies to the IMF, and as  their currencies dropped in value producers found that on average their budgets  bought just one-twentieth of the film stock they had before. And African film  dropped its love of the here and now, of the newly self-determined, and started  to look backwards. Oral storytellers - griots - became a focus, along with  village life, medieval settings, tribal culture and the world before Arab-Islam  and Euro-Christianity began to dominate. Senegal  was still a centre but Burkina Faso  and Mali  came to the fore. Their film-makers asked new questions: not ‘What do we do now  that the colonisers have gone?' but ‘What were we like before they arrived?'  The Maghreb film-makers of the north and the black African masters Sembène,  Mambéty and Hondo were joined by three new directors of world class: Burkina Faso's Gaston Kaboré and Idrissa  Ouédraogo, and Mali's  Souleymane Cissé. </p>
<p>Kaboré's <cite>Wend Kuuni</cite> (1982), set sometime before 1800, centres on a mute boy  found in the bush who is adopted by villagers. Cissé's <cite>Yeelen</cite> (1987), set around 1500, takes a young man with magical  powers on an Oedipal journey into the complex cosmology of his tribe.  Ouédraogo's <cite>Yaaba </cite>(1989) shows how a  boy bonds with an old woman whom the locals call a witch. In these encounters  with mythic dreamtime, men talk to animals and trees; in <cite>Yeelen</cite> a dog walks backwards as if he's in Notting Hill at the end  of <cite>Performance</cite>. </p>
<p>I watched my first African film, <cite>Yeelen</cite>, in 1990 and it changed my taste  in cinema. I had read Roy Armes' book <cite>Third  World Film Making and the West</cite> sometime after it came out in paperback in  1987, and so carried in my head the names of African films I wanted to pursue.  Armes himself had seen his first African films in Bulgaria in 1978-9. He writes: "I  discovered, much to my surprise, that there was indeed an African cinema, made  by African film-makers, happily removed from the Tarzan films I devoured as a  child." Removed indeed: <cite>Yeelen </cite>rained  on the parade of pleasures I'd experienced watching Tarzan and <cite>The African Queen</cite> and <cite>Pépé le Moko</cite>. I turned 20 when <cite>Out of Africa </cite>was released, and seeing <cite>Yeelen</cite> made it look like Edenic  paternalism.</p>
<p>After <cite>Yeelen</cite> I sought out Hondo's <cite>Sarraounia</cite> (1986), then <cite>Yaaba </cite>(1989), then  Mambéty's <cite>Touki Bouki</cite>. By this stage  the escapist, erotic pleasures I'd felt watching western films about Africa had been turned upside down. I was hungry for more  films from Dakar  - a place, I'd decided, that was as exciting cinematically in the 1970s as LA.  Why was Sembène not part of the canon of great directors, like Sergio Leone or  Ingmar Bergman? And I hadn't yet heard of Hailé Gerima or Safi Faye.</p>
<p>Now that I was belatedly paying  attention, I began to see what a feast African cinema in the 1990s was turning out to be.  In the Maghreb, Morocco's  Mohamed Abderrahman Tazi made the delightful comedy <cite>Looking for My</cite> <cite>Wife's Husband</cite> (1994). Tunisia  fired out Férid Boughedir's <cite>Halfaouine</cite> (1990), about a 12-year-old boy negotiating the difference between female and  male culture as he becomes a man; Moncef Dhouib's bleak semi-response to  Boughedir's film, <cite>The Sultan of the City</cite> (1992); and Moufida Tlatli's <cite>The Silences  of the Palace </cite>(1994). And from Algeria  came Merzak Allouache's <cite>Bab</cite><cite> El-Oued   City</cite> (1994). These  last five all challenge the reactionary elements of Islam.</p>
<p>Black African cinema in the 1990s was  equally concerned with tolerance and modernity. In <cite>Guelwaar </cite>(1992) Sembène was again at his best, tearing into a story  about attempts to find and bury a body with comic energy and humanism. In Burkina Faso,  Dani Kouyate's <cite>Keita! The Voice of the  Griot</cite> (1995) seemed to suck in a fusion of 1970s and 1980s African movies  and breath out a dazzling portrait of a city boy who's been taught Darwinism  only to be told by a griot about his mythic ancestors. <cite>Guimba the Tyrant</cite> (1995), made by Cheick Oumar Sissoko (not to be  confused with Sissako), was framed by a griot too; this and <cite>Genesis</cite> (1999) show the Malian director  to be a master. In Lusophone Guinea-Bissau,  Flora Gomes' <cite>Tree of Blood</cite> (1996) was  again about the opposed values of rural and modern life, and his follow-up, the  musical <cite>Nha Fala</cite> (2002), was just as  good.</p>
<p>Another of these 1990s directors, Mauritania's Abderrahmane Sissako (see page 30),  is in the process of being acclaimed in Europe.  His <cite>Waiting for Happiness</cite> - as good  as Antonioni's <cite>The Passenger </cite>-  debuted in Cannes  in 2002, by which time he had already made three beautiful films: <cite>Sabriya</cite> and <cite>Rostov-Luanda</cite> in 1997 and <cite>Life  on Earth</cite> in 1998. Sissako's <cite>Bamako</cite> (2006),  with its caustic denunciation of African subservience and the World Bank,  signals a shift in the direction of Mambéty. </p>
<h3>Pasolini meets Mambéty</h3>
<p>The attention Sissako has  received represents a new chance for African cinema. But then it has had other  recent chances too. BBC4 ran a short season of films. In Edinburgh,  the Africa in Motion festival showed 15 programmes of classic African cinema,  some of it never before screened in the UK. Sembène and Chahine both had  films in competition at Cannes  in 2004, a concurrence that acted as a reminder of how <cite>young </cite>African cinema is - it was like seeing D.W. Griffith on the  Croisette. Yet when I tried to raise the funds for a television programme in  which these men who have invented the language of African film and excoriated  militant Islam and social conservatism would meet and talk, no British company  would commission it. Shame on them. Sissako <cite>en  fete</cite> is a chance for African cinema, but perhaps a small one. </p>
<p>A quarter of a million people marched  around Edinburgh in July 2005 wearing white T-shirts and wristbands that said  ‘Make Poverty History' because they had read in newspapers and watched on  television accounts of a continent eviscerated by debt repayments, poverty and  illness. Yet how many people in the UK  will buy a ticket for <cite>Bamako</cite>, a great  work of art that addresses some of these themes? And how many British film  lovers have seen Mambéty's excoriating <cite>Hyenas</cite>?  African cinema, despite its bravura, inventiveness and loveliness, remains on  the to-do list. </p>
<p>This has several implications. The  first is that the innovations of African film have not had much influence.  Surely Werner Herzog, who at the age of 18 ventured across the Sudan, would  have collaborated with or have been affected by Sembène if he'd seen his work.  Wouldn't Pier Paolo Pasolini, who filmed several times in Africa,  have found a kindred spirit in Mambéty or Gerima? And might Sembène's  combination of neorealism and poetry, his elevation of the objects and events  of everyday life into something resonant, not have influenced the evolution of  the great Iranian directors? Daryush Mehrjui started rethinking Iranian cinema  in 1970, four years after Sembène's first important work. Arabic and Indian  popular cinema have always found enthusiastic audiences in Africa,  but the iniquities of film history have deprived us of a possible collaboration  between the great African and Persian directors.</p>
<p>It is time to stop having to imagine  such encounters, but instead to commission books, films, articles, seasons and  documentaries that restore this film culture to its proper place. Then,  perhaps, when we talk with our friends about the great films of the 1970s,  we'll mention Mambéty in the same breath as Scorsese, Bertolucci or Wenders.  Then <cite>Ceddo</cite> will be as familiar to us  as <cite>Taxi Driver</cite>.</p>

          <h1><a name="top">Prague Celtic History Remains Route Celtic Walk in Prague</a></h1>
          	<p><img src="images/Celtic.jpg" class="floatright" alt="" width="200" height="282" /> At the South periphery of Prague is a territory, which could have been, instead of <a href="http://www.prague.net/prague-castle">Prague Castle, the centre of our capital city</a>, and so, of the Czech country. At both the banks of Breznansky potok there once was an extensive Celtic oppidum, which is introduced to you by the educational footpath.</p>

	<p>The fortified Celtic settlements, known as oppidums, were extensive centres of business, territory management and spiritual sphere, something like capital city of the whole tribal territory. Oppidum among Tocna and Dolejsi Breznany originates in sixth century BC. And it was placed on who hills above the Vrezanske udoli. The southern part, located outside the capital city border is called Zaviost, the northern one, the one in Prague, is called Sance. Both parts were connected by a continuous line of fortifications long cca nine kilometres and the total area of the oppidum is 170 hectares. </p>

	<p>Judging according to the area, it is the most extensive Celtic settlement in the Czech Republic, and one of the biggest in Europe. If you want to see it with your own eyes and make a nice trip to the nature on your summer afternoon, there is nothing easier. You just get to Namesti Antonina Pecaka by Bus 173, 341, or 342 to the station Tocna, from where you will continue by the yellow tourist sign through the street Na Strankach, at which end is the introductory panel of the tourist rout you are on. </p>

	<p>You will go by a nice forest-park most of the time, at one spot there is a steep hill, for climbing it, you will be rewarded by a view to Zbraslav form a mountrain terrace above the Breznske udoli. After the return to the road, you will continue by the Vltava river, to the remains of Zavist settlement. </p>

	<p>The whole educational road is long about two kilometres, has eleven information stops and it is touristically marked. </p>

	<p>The most unique Celtic find is the Celt warrior head which was found in Msecke Zehrovice not far from Prague in 1943. It is deposited (together with other Celt finds) <a href="http://www.prague.net/national-museum">in Prague National Museum</a>.</p>

	<p>The fact is that Celts used to live in Prague&#8217;s vicinity and that the settlements were densely populated. Celts came to Bohemia between 5th and 4th century B.C. and one of their tribes, the Boii, gave it the name (Bohemia).This tribe also dwelt in Bavaria which means that the Celtic settlements stretched from Prague to France. There are some theories about Czechs being their descendants. It appears that Celts didn&#8217;t come here thanks to their wars and attacks that are described in Roman historical books; there was a gradual development from previous cultures.</p>

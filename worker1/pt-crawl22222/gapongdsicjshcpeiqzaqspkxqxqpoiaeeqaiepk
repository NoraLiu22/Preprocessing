                        in the 1560s they discovered that the native languages,
                        particularly Tagalog, Ilocano and Visayan, had no native
                        Alphabet to speak of. What passed for their Alphabet was
                        some kind of a syllabary, called Baybayin or Al�bat�,
                        inherited from a vague Arab influence that irradiated
                        from the previously dominant Sultanate of Jol� or Sul�.</font><o:p>

                        time, what was, perhaps, one Al�bata or Baybayin took
                        many written forms to the extent that the Tagalog Al�bata
                        or Baybayin , for instance, could no longer be read by
                        Ilocanos and Visayans for it had developed independently
                        from that used in Tagalog until it just became
                        different.<o:p>

                        of respectively the Ilocanos and the Visayans, because
                        these, too, developed into different or unintelligible
                        forms.<o:p>

                        the first typographer and printer of these islands, the
                        Chino Cristiano Tom�s Pinp�n, was commissioned to
                        print the first Doctrina Cristiana booklets for each
                        native language, different typographical sets of the
                        Alibat�s had to be manufactured. Tom�s Pinpin saw that
                        he had to hand-make each typographic letter from each
                        Alibata. Thus, as Tom�s Pinpin was to painstakingly
                        make, by hand, wooden letter chips, to form each word to
                        be printed, he realized that the completion of so many
                        sets of Alibata, was to take a lot of time, possibly
                        years.<o:p>

                        is but a fact that the printing procedure used by his
                        immediate predecessor, Juan de Vera Ken Yong, consisted
                        in carving out letters or characters from a flat wooden
                        board upon which ink was later sprinkled to reproduce
                        the letters, or characters, on a piece of rice paper
                        laid and pressed over that same board. This was the
                        printing system then known as the xylographic method,
                        which originated from the Chinese.<o:p>

                        the Friar-Doctrinas, must have really seen himself
                        immersed in a dilemma, in view of the several ancient
                        Alphabets, or Alibatas or baybayins, as researched by
                        Dr. T.H. Pardo de Tavera.<o:p>

                        being Chinese in origin, Tom�s Pinpin was well aware of
                        the fact that mainland China, like his Islas Filipinas,
                        also had many languages, ---with the difference that all
                        those languages of China always had one common system of
                        writing.<o:p>

                        that time, generally the same in all the Chinese
                        languages including Japanese and Korean.<o:p>

                        different sets of Alibat�s for every major language of
                        the Islands, the first Filipino typographer and printer
                        in Tom�s Pinpin did decide, with the tacit conformity
                        of the Spanish Dominican missionaries, to adopt for all
                        the native languages, the Spanish-European Alphabet and

                        system of letters and no longer write using the

                        made Tom�s Pinp�n introduce for Tagalog, Ilocano and

                        planned destruction of Tagalog as the potential basis of
                        the Filipino national language began in 1935 when the
                        twenty letter Abakada, which is an almost
                        transliteration of the pre-Hispanic Baybayin or Alibata,
                        was imposed as its alphabet through the Lope K. Santos
                        Balarila. But, by 1973, due to the language controversy
                        that visited the National Language Committee of the
                        1971-73 Philippine Constitutional Convention, it was
                        decided that the 20-letter-Abakada that came with the
                        Balarila textbook introduced after 1935 was an
                        anachronism, therefore useless, that tended to even harm
                        the Tagalog Language itself as the proposed basis of the
                        national language.<o:p>

                        was actually clearly shown, during the National Language
                        Committee hearings of the 1971-1973 Philippine
                        Constitutional Convention, that the Balarila-Abakada
                        &quot;innovation&quot; surreptitiously introduced into
                        the Tagalog Language since 1935 was there to hamstrung,
                        if not to deliberately frustrate, the development of
                        Tagalog as the basis of the national language then
                        called &quot;Pilipino&quot;.<o:p>

                        is, of course, the earlier conviction that Dean C.
                        Worcester, then Director of Education in these Islands
                        during the early years of the U.S. WASP occupation, had
                        a direct hand in persuading Lope K. Santos to use the
                        20-letter Abakada in the Balarila instead of retaining
                        the 32-letter Abecedario used by Francisco Balagt�s
                        when the latter wrote Florante at Laura about hundred
                        years earlier. Dean C. Worcester was also well-known as
                        the filer of the El Renacimiento-Muling Pagsilang libel
                        case (1908) which threateningly ordered the imprisonment
                        of Lope K. Santos as the editor of Muling Pagsilang.<o:p>

                        that time, Lope K. Santos was already known as a great
                        grammarian in both Spanish and Tagalog. In an interview
                        with Iloilo writer Guillermo G�mezWindham, it is
                        revealed that Lope K. Santos was persuaded to include in
                        his Balarila textbook the 20-letter Abakada in line with
                        the sectarian WASP's agenda to debase Tagalog so that it
                        would not serve, in the long run, as the strong basis,
                        that it should be, for the national language project.
                        And once Tagalog had been turned into a debased language
                        of so many coined or &quot;purista&quot; words due to
                        its limited and outmoded Abakada introduced into its
                        orthography, it could then be declared as defective and
                        backward with the proviso that for it to improve it
                        needed the imposition in it of the English Alphabet.<o:p>

                        process of &quot;purifying&quot; Tagalog with the
                        Abakada was but a phase to destroy it at the end by
                        turning it into a vile Pidgin of English through the
                        treachery of ramming into it, the entire unphonetic
                        English Alphabet.</font><o:p>

                        is not far-fetched to conclude that Dean C. Worcester
                        already saw in the Tagalog language of 1901 a future
                        obstacle to the neocolonial imposition of English in the
                        Philippines. And because of that fear, Tagalog had to be
                        treacherously, albeit subtly, crippled from the start
                        with the imposition of an inadequate pre-Hispanic
                        Abakada (with its consonants read with a flat
                        &quot;AH&quot;) in lieu of its already fully-developed
                        32-letter Balagt�s Alphabet which consonants, as we
                        said, are read with the Batangue�o &quot;EH&quot;.<o:p>

                        the Abakada and the complicated Balarila were then
                        engineered to discredit Tagalog by still making it
                        appear as a pre-Hispanic language so that it could never
                        compete, in the future, with English in its own country
                        as the official language in fact.. Dean C. Worcester and
                        his ilk, moreover, knew that Tagalog, with its 32-letter
                        Balagt�s Alphabet was structurally superior to English
                        in phonics and spelling. (Mahirap ispilingin ang Ingl�s.)<o:p>

                        and as we have already pointed out, since the 1971-73
                        Constitutional Convention, the Abakada became a thing of
                        the past. But, to continue with Worcester's obvious plan
                        to destroy Tagalog, the &quot;Commission on
                        Filipino&quot; leadership has managed to now ram into
                        this language the entire English Alphabet to cripple
                        Tagalog anew.<o:p>

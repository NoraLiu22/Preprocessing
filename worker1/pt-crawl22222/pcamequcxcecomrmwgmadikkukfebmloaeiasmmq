		system (often called hieroglyphics from a vague superficial resemblance 
		to the Egyptian writing, to which it is not related) was a combination 
		of phonetic symbols and ideograms. It is the only writing system of the 
		Pre-Columbian New World that can completely represent spoken language to 
		the same degree as the written language of the old world. Early sites 
			such as <a href="takalik.htm">Takalik Abaj </a>in the
			<a href="pacific_lowlands.htm">Pacific Lowlands </a>has inscriptions 
			with the early Maya style. The <a href="san_bartolo1.htm">San

			oldest known, dating to 300 BC. &quot;The text is 1,000 years before the 
			late Classic writing, which we are good at reading � up to 95 
			percent of it,&quot; Dr. Stuart said. &quot;Any script is going to go through 
			significant changes over that time. But these glyphs are very 
			unusual, very different from later writing.&quot;<br>
			The single glyph he thought he could read was the seventh one down 
			the column. It includes the sign for the word lord or noble. &quot;But if 
			it referred to a true king,&quot; Dr. Stuart said, &quot;the sign would have a 
			symbol with it to say 'divine lord.' &quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
			inability to read the text, Dr. Houston said, may be because the 
			Maya system underwent a major change at the time the Preclassic 
			culture collapsed, around A.D. 100 to 200, with widespread evidence 
			of destroyed or abandoned cities. Archaeologists expressed hope that 
			more of the text or similar ones would eventually be found and that 
			new efforts would be made to search for writing at larger Preclassic

		accelerated rapidly thereafter, so that now the majority of Maya texts 
		can be read nearly completely in their original languages. Recently it 
			was suggested that Classic texts were written not in Ch'olan and/or 
			Yukatekan Mayan, as long assumed, but in a &quot;prestige&quot; or &quot;high&quot; 
			language called Classic Ch'olti'an, related to the now extinct 
			Ch'olti' language of the Eastern Ch'olan Maya language family

		decipherment for years. Indeed, it was only in the mid-twentieth century 
		following a breakthrough by Mayanist Tatiana Proskouriakoff, studying 
			the <a href="piedras_negras1.htm">Piedras Negras</a> Stela 14 in Pet�n (Above), She suggested that 
			these &quot;niche&quot; scenes represented rulers newly seated on their 
			thrones. She pointed out that the &quot;niche&quot; Stela always carried the 
			earliest dates of their series and that a certain set of &quot;inaugural&quot; 
			hieroglyphs followed those dates whenever they appeared in later 
			texts. This breakthrough led to the recognition of birth and death 
			glyphs, the name-glyphs of the rulers, parentage information, the 
			capture of enemies, and other biographical items from the lives of 
			the Maya rulers. Since then, 
		epigraphers (or glyphic experts) could finally agree that Maya 
		Hieroglyphic Writing was a fully functional system based on phonetic 
		signs.&nbsp; In 1958 by Heinrich Berlin,&nbsp; discovered the &quot;emblem 
			glyph.&quot; After surveying a wide range of Maya inscriptions, Berlin 
			noticed the presence of a specialized type of hieroglyph that always 
			consisted of a standard set of affixes combined with variable main 
			signs. Each main sign had a limited distribution, occurring, with a 
			few exceptions, at one site and no other. Today it is recognized as

			</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFF00">huun</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF">,

			bark-cloth tunics as a possible means of transmitting information: 
			�early in their history the Mayas produced a kind of tapa cloth from 
			the inner bark of certain trees, the main being the wild fig tree or 
			Amate.&nbsp; Bark-cloth manufacture apparently evolved into 
			papermaking, although when this occurred is not known�. This 
			�paper,� superior in texture, durability, and plasticity to Egyptian 
			papyrus, was thus perfected anonymously and communally by the Maya. 
			(Sandstrom and Sandstrom, Traditional Papermaking 13). The Maya 
			developed paper screen-fold codices as a direct step beyond carving 
			information into stone buildings and stelas, unlike Western

			<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 11pt">There is a codex in Paris

			<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 11pt">Another major 
		example of Maya almanacs is present in the Madrid Codex it is 23 cm. 
			(9.6 in.) high, it measures no less than 6.82 m. (22 ft. 6 in.) in 
			length, offering its scribe 112 pages covering slightly under 5,000 
			inches of available surface. The fourth 
		codex is called the Grolier and was authenticated as late as 1983. These 
		codices probably contained much of the information used by priests or 
		the noble class to determine dates of importance or seasonal interest. 
		We can only speculate as to whether or not the Maya developed poetry or 
		drama that was committed to paper. The codices probably kept track of 
		dynastic information as well.&nbsp; Dresden Codex probably most closely 
			resembles the books of the Classic period; its pages are only 9 cm. 
			wide, in contrast to the 12.2 cm. of the Madrid, and the 12.5 cm of 
			the Paris and Grolier. The small, calligraphically elegant writing 
			of the Dresden is in perfect harmony with the comparatively small 
			size of its pages. (Coe 171) <br>

			<p align="justify"><i>
			<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 11pt">Mayans had a 
		voluminous literature, covering the whole range of native interests 
		either written, in their own peculiar &quot;calculiform&quot; hieroglyphic 
		characters, in books of maguey paper or parchment which were bound in 
		word, or carved upon the walls of their public buildings.&nbsp; The 
			oldest Maya codices known have been found by archaeologists as 
			mortuary offerings with burials in excavations in
			<a href="uaxactun1.htm">Uaxact�n</a>, <a href="guaytan.htm">Guayt�n</a>, 
			and Nebaj in Guatemala, at Altun Ha in Belize and at Cop�n in 
			Honduras. The six examples of Maya books discovered in excavations 
			date to the Early Classic (Uaxact�n and Altun Ha), Late Classic 
			(Nebaj, Cop�n), and Early Postclassic (Guayt�n) periods and, 
			unfortunately, all have been changed by the pressure and humidity in 
			the ground during their many years in the ground, eliminating the 
			organic backing and reducing all into unopenable masses or 
			collections of very small flakes and bits of the original lime 
			sizing and multicolor painting. The result being, unfortunately, 
			more old books which will probably never be read. (Whiting 207-208)

		the Capitol of the Itz�es, (in the modern City of Flores, Pet�n) that

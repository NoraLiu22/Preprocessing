			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The United States Constitution was 
			influenced by the concepts and the principles contained in the 
			Iroquois Indian Confederacy form of governance which was founded in 
			Native American mythology. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Several different areas must be 
			discussed in order to substantiate this premise that the Native 
			Americans that arrived on the North American continent around 12,000 
			years ago did indeed influence the very basis of the United States 
			governmental system which is written in the form of the United 
			States Constitution. One of the first concepts which must be 
			explored is the tradition of the Iroquois League, since the basis of 
			the thesis is that the League tradition preceded and influenced the 
			thinking of the Founding Fathers. The next topics must include a 
			discussion of opinions and supporting details that the Iroquoian 
			Confederacy method of governance did influence the development of 
			the U.S. Constitution and specifically how key contributors to the 
			writing of the Constitution, including Benjamin Franklin and Thomas 
			Jefferson, were brought into the Native American sphere of thinking. 
			Finally, a comparison of the League Tradition and several areas of 
			the U.S. Constitution will show clearly that the &quot;Native American 
			Myth&quot; lives on even though the Native American population has been 
			drastically diminished by the very Country which it helped to found.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Iroquois League tradition was 
			first written down in an Iroquois language format in 1912 by 
			anthropologist Alexander A. Goldenweiser.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#1">1</a></sup> 
			This handwritten transcript as dictated by Chief John Arthur Gibson 
			has been recently (1992) newly elicited, edited and translated by 
			Hanni Woodbury in collaboration with Reg Henry and Harry Webster 
			with the resultant fluently reading legend of the foundation of the 
			League of the Iroquois. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chief John Gibson, born in 1849 was 
			&quot;unquestionably the greatest mind of his generation among the Six 
			Nations... [who] became the greatest living source on Iroquois 
			culture at the turn of the century.&quot;<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#2">2</a></sup> 
			Chief Gibson was appointed a member of a committee of chiefs that 
			undertook the task of codifying the League Tradition because of the 
			high regard by his own people for his knowledge of the League 
			traditions and the various rituals connected with them.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#3">3</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">What follows is a condensed version 
			of the League Tradition as put forth in the work translated by Hanni 
			Woodbury which will provide a general overview of the mythology 
			which lead to the Tradition and the components of the Tradition 
			which allowed a working unification system for the Iroquois 
			Confederacy. This Confederacy contained the original Five Nations of 
			the Confederacy which included the Seneca, Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida 
			and Cayuga and in 1715 increased to Six Nations with the inclusion 
			of the Tuscaroras. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Feuding and warfare were endemic in 
			the land of the Mohawks which was located on the northern shore of 
			Lake Ontario. A mother Kahetoktha (&quot;End of the Field&quot;) takes her 
			daughter Kahetehsuk (&quot;She Walks Ahead&quot;) to live in a remote area of 
			bush in order to protect her child. After living there a 
			considerable amount of time the daughter becomes pregnant and the 
			Mother accuses her daughter of wrongdoing. The Mother then has a 
			dream from the messenger of the Great Spirit which reveals her 
			daughter and not been with a man and will have a divine birth and 
			the boy child to be born will be called Tekanawita and his life will 
			be devoted to promoting peace among men. After the dream message is 
			received the Mother and daughter reconcile and the son is born as 
			prophesied. The boy grows quickly and when he is a young man 
			Tekanawita returns to his mother&#39;s and grandmother&#39;s former 
			settlement to announce to their people the Good Message (kaihwiyoh), 
			the Power (katshatstehsae) and the Peace (shenu) which are the three 
			concepts that together spell out the call to unify the separate 
			nations of the Iriquois.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#4">4</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Tekanawita visits the then separate 
			nations and convinces them through demonstrating some miraculous 
			feats. One such trial proposed by the Mohawk Nation was 
			forTekanawita to sit atop a tree next to the river. The tree would 
			then be cut down and Tekanawita would be thrown into the cold raging 
			waters. If he emerged the next day alive this would be proof that he 
			was the true messenger of the Great Spirit and the Good Message, the 
			Power and the Peace would be accepted. When he successfully emerges 
			the next day from the waters the Mohawk tribe is convinced. The five 
			nations are receptive to the message and Tekanawita proceeds to 
			frame the central concepts of the Great Law and organizes the 
			Confederacy Council on the basis of principles which underlie 
			Iroquois social structure. He divides the five nations into moieties 
			related to one another as fathers (Mohawk, Onondaga and Seneca) and 
			sons (Oneida and Cayuga).<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#5">5</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The decision making process which was 
			to be followed involved the Mohawk Nation considering the issue and 
			after a consensus is reached within the Nation, V&#39; the question was 
			to be passed to their moiety brother, the Seneca who reach a 
			consensus. There is to be an attempt to consolidate their decision 
			with that of the Mohawk. If two groups agree they are to appoint a 
			speaker for the moiety who moves&#39;across the fire&#39;to bring the 
			opinion and the question to the Oneida. The Oneida are to pass the 
			question on to the Cayuga and if the two groups reach consensus the 
			issue is to be passed back across the fire to the Mohawk who present 
			the outcome to the firekeepers, the Onondagas. The Onondagas then 
			consider the issue and if they agree with the consensus reached by 
			the other four nations, they ratify the opinion.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#6">6</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, if there are divergent 
			opinions from the Mohawk and Seneca, both opinions are to be handed 
			across the fire to the Oneida and Cayuga to be considered equally. 
			If the Oneida and Cayuga are split in opinion then both opinions 
			must be handed on to the firekeepers. The Firekeepers can break the 
			tie by choosing one opinion over the other. If the Oneida and Cayuga 
			agree wit just one of the opinions handed to them by the Mohawk and 
			Seneca, they return this opinion to the latter, and the speaker for 
			the Mohawk and Seneca will present the opinions to the firekeepers, 
			with an explanation of the outcome. The Onondaga consider the issue 
			together with the results arrived at among the other nations, and 
			the final decision will be announced.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#7">7</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After establishing the vital decision 
			making process to be followed Tekanawita establishes the symbolism 
			of the central hearth, that is the Confederacy fire, &quot;whose smoke 
			will rise, the beautiful smoke, piercing the sky.&quot;<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#8">8</a></sup> 
			At the central fire he planted a tree - a great white pine - that 
			put forth white roots East, West, North and South. Each nation would 
			contribute one arrow to form a single strong bundle bound together 
			with the sinew of a deer and as joined were to represent the 
			Confederacy solidarity. Tekanawita addressed the Nations with the 
			message that all Nations exercise equal authority in the Confederacy 
			and that as individuals the Chiefs - the tall trunks of the 
			Confederacy - are all equal in status. He then warned that if the 
			arrows of the Nations are withdrawn from the bundle that represent 
			the power of their solidarity, the bundle of arrows will weaken.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#9">9</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After describing the basic workings 
			of the Confederacy, Tekanawita called a lengthy recess, and members 
			of the council returned to their settlements to inform the people of 
			the Confederacy of the formation and to determine the existing 
			organization of lineages and clans in their respective nations, and 
			to select in terms of their lineage affiliations more candidates for 
			the positions on the council. Fifty titles are eventually assigned 
			by clan and were assigned as follows- Mohawk - 9, Seneca - 8, Oneida 
			- 9, Cayuga -10, and Onondaga - 14. The women of the clan or clan 
			mothers were designated to be the holders of the clan titles and had 
			control in large measure in the choice of successors.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#10">10</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The chiefs appointed were expected to 
			maintain certain standards or there was to be a recall process that 
			would be followed. At times of stress in the Confederacy, the 
			hereditary Chiefs were to be allowed to appoint a &quot;Pine Tree&quot; Chief 
			who would have special skills or qualities that could be of help to 
			the hereditary chiefs in their difficult tasks. Pine Tree Chiefs 
			were to be appointed for life and their titles were not to be passed 
			on after their death.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#11">11</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The final major process that 
			Tekanawita was to call for was the orderly replacement of the Chiefs 
			upon their dismissal or more likely their death. This process was to 
			allow an orderly transition of power within the Confederacy. This 
			process consisted of the Clan Matron selecting a candidate and the 
			women of the clan approving the selection followed by the chiefs who 
			represent the tribal moiety, then the Chiefs of the Nation, then the 
			Chiefs from her side of the Confederacy fire. At the Condolence 
			Council the candidate was to be &quot;stood up&quot; for approval by the 
			chiefs of the opposite moiety. The candidate is to be raised up by 
			being &quot;crowned with the antlers&quot; of office representing his status 
			as a Chief.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#12">12</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This was then the basic outline of 
			the principles and philosophy of the Confederacy of the Iroquois. 
			They agreed to stop fighting amongst themselves and to accept the 
			Good Message that called upon them to find a peaceful way to resolve 
			issues among the tribes. They were directed by the messenger of the 
			Great Spirit to uphold certain standards of leadership and to fill 
			vacancies in a peaceful manner. They were to stand together so that 
			they may be stronger than one individual tribe. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a plethora of opinion which 
			concurs with the thesis that the Iroquois Confederacy had a strong 
			influence on the final document which was to be the law of the land 
			for the United States from its inception to present day. Some of 
			these sources not only attribute the Iroquois Confederacy with 
			significantly affecting the form of the Government of the United 
			States but also with instilling the American independence mentality 
			which would give rise to the impetus to make the initial break from 
			the British. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the Indians were standing along 
			the shore watching the Puritans arrive, the Indians carried with 
			them a tradition of meeting and democracy, of free speech, of free 
			thinking, of tolerance for each other&#39;s differences of religion, of 
			all those things which got attached to the Bill of Rights.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#13">13</a></sup> 
			White leaders watched the method of government that the Iroquois 
			utilized and they learned union and democracy from it. Historians 
			are now beginning to admit what they must have been aware of, that 
			the government of the United States is not patterned after something 
			across the ocean where there was a belief in the divine right of 
			kings and where the people had no voice, but it is patterned after 
			the government of<b> </b>the People of<b> </b>the Long House,<b> </b>
			where all people,<b> </b>including both men and women were respected 
			and took a part in their government.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#14">14</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The interaction between the colonial 
			Americans and the Iroquois Confederacy began immediately upon the 
			arrival of the Europeans. The importance of conciliating the 
			powerful Confederacy was fully appreciated by the colonial 
			authorities and great pains were taken to secure and retain the 
			favor of the confederacy. Each successive governor announced his 
			arrival to the Sachems of the League, and invited them to meet him 
			in council, at an early day, to renew the &quot;covenant chain&quot; or 
			agreement to work together peacefully.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#15">15</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Beginning in the early 1740&#39;s, 
			Iroquois leaders strongly urged the colonists to form a federation 
			similar to their own with the immediate benefit to their interests 
			of having a unified management of Indian trade with resultant 
			minimization of fraud, and a unity of the two peoples in the face of 
			the &quot;cold war&quot; which was occurring between the English and the 
			French.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#16">16</a></sup> 
			This urging became a more forceful admonition when the Iroquois 
			Chief Canssatego spoke to Pennsylvania officials gathered at 
			Lancaster in 1744 with the following words: </font></p>
			<ul>
				<font face="Arial" size="2">Our wise forefathers established 
				Union and Amity between the Five Nations. This has made us 
				formidable; this has given us great Weight and Authority with 
				our neighboring Nations. We are a powerful Confederacy; and by 
				your observing the same methods, our wise forefathers have 
				taken, you will acquire such Strength and power. Therefore 
				whatever befalls you, never fall our with one another.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#17">17</a></sup></font></ul>
			<font face="Arial" size="2">A crucial step forward towards colonial 
			American unification necessary for the eventual independence 
			movement took place in Albany, New York in 1754. The Albany Plan was 
			a landmark on the rough road that was to lead through the first 
			Continental Congress and the Articles of Confederation and then to 
			the Constitution of 1787.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#18">18</a></sup> 
			On the eve of the Albany Congress, Franklin had a great deal of 
			exposure to the imagery and political ideas of the Iroquois from 
			first hand experience and from his study of Cadwallader Colden&#39;s <i>
			History of the Five Nations.</i><sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#19">19</a></sup><i>
			</i>Franklin met with both Colonial and Iroquois delegates to create 
			a plan of unity that was in part derived from some of the tenets of 
			the Great Law of the Iroquois.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#20">20</a></sup> 
			During the discussions at Albany Franklin addressed the assemblage 
			in words that freely acknowledged the Iroquois Confederacy as a 
			model to build upon: </font>
			<ul>
				<font face="Arial" size="2">It would be a strange thing...if Six 
				Nations of ignorant savages should be capable of forming such a 
				union and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has 
				subsisted ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like 
				union should be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies, 
				to whom it is more necessary and must be more advantageous, and 
				who cannot be supposed to want an equal understanding of their 
				interest.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#21">21</a></sup></font></ul>
			<font face="Arial"><font size="2">When Franklin proposed his plan of 
			union before the Congress it had a &#39;Grand Council,&quot; a &quot;Speaker,&quot; and 
			called for a &quot;general government... under which... each colony may 
			retain its present constitution&quot; all nomenclature and concept 
			derived from the Confederacy.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#22">22</a></sup> 
			Franklin&#39;s writings indicate that as he became more deeply involved 
			with the Iroquois and other Indian peoples, he picked up ideas from 
			them concerning not only federalism, but concepts of natural rights, 
			the nature of society and man&#39;s place in it, the role of property in 
			society, and other intellectual constructs that would eventually be 
			called into service by Franklin as he and the other American 
			revolutionaries shaped an </font><b><font size="2">23 </font></b>
			<font size="2">official ideology for the soon to be founded United 
			States of America.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#23">23</a></sup>
			</font></font>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the relationship between the 
			colonies and Great Britain became more and more strained rebellion 
			became a more realistic and viable alternative. In the eyes of the 
			rebellious American Colonists, the Iroquois symbolized autonomy and 
			a new American identity.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#24">24</a></sup> 
			The intervening years between the Albany Plan of Union, the Articles 
			of Confederation and the final Declaration of Independence included 
			events such as the protest of the Stamp Act, the Boston Tea Party, 
			formation of the Sons of Liberty. Each of these events drew upon the 
			symbolism and philosophy of the Iroquois. The Sons of Liberty during 
			the Stamp Act Crisis sent wampum belts to the Iroquois asking them 
			to intercept the British moving down the Hudson.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#25">25</a></sup> 
			The Boston Tea Party was carried out by Colonists dressed as Indians 
			and the formation of the Sons of Liberty involved putting up a pine 
			post called the Tree of Liberty, a direct transference of symbolism 
			from the Iroquois symbol of Liberty.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#26">26</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On June 11, 1776, while the question 
			of independence was being debated, twenty-one visiting Iroquois 
			chiefs were actually lodged on the second floor of the Pennsylvania 
			State House and were formally invited into the meeting hall of the 
			Continental Congress.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#27">27</a></sup><b>
			</b>During speeches delivered to the delegation of Native Americans 
			they were addressed as &quot;Brothers&quot; and told of the delegates wish 
			that the &quot;friendship&quot; between them would &quot;continue as long as the 
			sun shall.&quot; shine&quot; and the &quot;water run.&quot;<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#28">28</a></sup> 
			The speech expressed hope that new Americans and Iroquois would act 
			&quot;as one people, and have but one heart.&quot;<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#29">29</a></sup> 
			In a speech on July 26, 1776, James Wilson, delegate from 
			Pennsylvania and future author of the first draft of the U.S. 
			Constitution, argued forcefully for a confederation similar to the 
			Iroquois League and asserted that &quot;Indians know the striking 
			benefits of confederation&quot; and we &quot;have an example of it in the 
			Union of the Six Nations.&quot;<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#30">30</a></sup> 
			In essence, Wilson, a friend of Franklin, believed that a strong 
			confederacy like the Iroquois Confederacy was crucial to the 
			development of a new nation and to maintaining a friendly 
			relationship with the Indian populations.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#31">31</a></sup>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thomas Jefferson has also documented 
			his appraisal of the attributes of the Native American concepts of 
			morality and governance. In his writings Jefferson states: </font>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<font face="Arial" size="2">Their only controls are their 
				manners, and that moral sense of right and wrong, which, like 
				the sense of tasting and feeling in every man, makes a part of 
				his nature. An offense against these is punished by contempt, by 
				exclusion from society, or, where the case is serious, as that 
				of murder, by the individuals whom it concerns. Imperfect as 
				this species of coercion may seem, crimes are very rare among 
				them; insomuch that were it made a question, whether no law, as 
				among the savage American, or too much law, as among the 
				civilized Europeans, submits man to the greatest evil, one who 
				has seen both conditions of existence would pronounce it to be 
				the last; and that the sheep are happier of themselves, than 
				under care of the wolves. It will be said, the great societies 
				cannot exist without government. The savages, therefore, break 
				them into small ones.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#32">32</a></sup></font></ul>
			<font face="Arial" size="2">Several areas of the Iroquois 
			Constitution of the Five Nations which clearly have a parallel in 
			the U.S. Constitution would be paragraph 84 dealing with the right 
			of self-determination, paragraph 96, stipulating government by the 
			people, &quot;by the consent of the governed,&quot; Paragraph 98 stating

			Paragraph 33 stipulates the process by which a Chief shall be 
			replaced upon dismissal or death. This systematic transmission of 
			official rank was, in fact, the vital principle of the Iroquois 
			Government.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#34">34</a></sup>

			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The decision-making process of the 
			League resembles that of a two-house congress in one body,<b> </b>
			with the &quot;older brothers&quot; and &quot;younger brother&quot; each comprising a 
			side of the house.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#35">35</a></sup><b>
			</b>The Onondagas filled something of an executive role, with a veto 
			that could be overridden by the older and younger brothers in 
			concert.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#36">36</a></sup>

			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By implication in five places within 
			the U.S. Constitution the impact of the Iroquois Confederacy&#39;s 
			continual urgings that the colonists should coordinate Indian 
			negotiations and policies through a central authority were codified.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#37">37</a></sup> 
			This codification is included in Article 11, Section 10, which 
			prohibits the States from entering into treaties; Article 11, 
			Section 2, which also prohibits States from entering into treaties; 
			Article 11, Section 2, Clause 2, which defines the treaty process- 
			Article VI,<b> </b>Section 2, which defines a treaty as the supreme 
			law of the land; and finally, Article 111, Section 2, which grants 
			the federal courts over U.S. citizenry who violate treaties.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#38">38</a></sup> 
			These provisos were to find an impact on the Native American 
			populations to present day<b> </b>and beyond. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even in light of the preceding 
			discussion of the documented influence by<b> </b>the Iroquois 
			Confederacy on the Founding Fathers and the resultant inclusion of 
			many of the basic concepts and premises of the Iroquois Law<b> </b>
			within the U.S.<b> </b>Constitution, there is still an apparent 
			oversight of the this impact in a scholarly work as recently as 
			1994. David <b>N. </b>Mayor in his discussion of the influences on 
			the thinking of Thomas Jefferson<b> </b>in relation to his 
			intellectual contribution to the U. S.<b> </b>Constitution mentions 
			only Locke, Scottish<b> </b>moral sense of philosophy,<b> </b>
			deistic natural religion and the economic theories developed by<b>
			</b>British and French antimercantilists.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#39">39</a></sup> 
			Not one mention or word of<b> </b>credit is given to the Native 
			Americans who have so clearly been a major contributor in the 
			formation of the American persona. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Donald A.<b> </b>Grinde comments that 
			ignoring the processes whereby Euroamericans created a new culture 
			out of the American experience impoverishes everyone and gives an 
			appearance that scholars are seeking to stop the process of 
			de-Europeanizing America.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#40">40</a></sup> 
			He specifically discusses Temple University anthropologist Dr. 
			Elisabeth Tooker who contends that American Indian government 
			figures &quot;not at all in the standard histories of the Constitution, 
			nor in the documents on which they rest.&quot;<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.fsc.edu/socsci/savant/CONST/mythnote.htm#41">41</a></sup> 
			As a refutation of this premise Grinde goes on to quote many of the 
			specifics of the writings generated by the founders some of which 
			have been stated herein along with scholarly input with 
			justification for their own viewpoint. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is truly a revelation as a student 
			of history to study the impact that Native America had in the 
			development of the United States of America. The fact that the 
			Native Americans preceded the settlement of the Europeans and were a 
			part of the innate character of the New World must logically affect 
			the development of the new settlers. It is the ultimate irony that 
			by<b> </b>the initial assistance given to the entering immigrants by<b>
			</b>the Native American population that they were in fact aiding in 
			the ultimate decimation of their people, and the diminishment of 
			their land and their mythological based form of government. </font>

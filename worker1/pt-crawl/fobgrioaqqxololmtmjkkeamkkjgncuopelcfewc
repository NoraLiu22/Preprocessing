                                    <h3>Why Not the Latest Observations?</h3>

<p>We use annual data for our computations, therefore, it is necessary to have an annual observation for both the initial year and the desired year.  For the indices based on GDP, it is only after the year is over that GDP can be measured. For price indices, the annual observations are usually the average of monthly observations. It would not be valid to compare a monthly observation in the current year with an annual observation in an earlier year.</p>

<p>We have created many of the historical series in MeasuringWorth, but the most recent observations are obtained from government agencies. The annual CPI and RPI observations are usually published in the first month or two of the next year, however the numbers for GDP do not come out until later.  We strive to get the new numbers up as quickly as possible.</p>

                Determining the<em> relative</em> value of an amount of money in one year (the initial year) compared to another (the desired year) is more complicated than it seems at first. There is no single &quot;correct&quot; measure, and economic historians use one or more different index
                    depending on the context of the question. </p>
              <p>An index such as the Consumer Price Index is measured as the price of a &quot;bundle&quot; of goods and services that a representative group buys or earns. Over time the bundle changes; for example, carriages are replaced with automobiles, and new goods and services
                    are invented such as cellular phones and heart transplants.</p>
                <p>These considerations do not stop the fascination with these comparisons or even the necessity for them. For example, such comparisons may be critical to determine appropriate levels of compensation in a legal case that has been deferred.
                    The context of the question, however, may lead to a preferable measure other than the <i>real price</i> (<em>real wage,</em> or <em>real cost</em>) as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is used far too often without thought to its consequences.  <br>
                    </p>
                <p>Therefore, when talking about the (relative) worth of an item, it should be&nbsp;<em>categorized</em>&nbsp;as a commodity, a project, or an observation of compensation or wealth. Then (and only then) should it be measured relative to well-defined indexes of economic activity that put the item in perspective. This process will generate specific definitions of relative worth that depend on the index used and the type of item it is.</p>
            <p>

                        The <strong>CPI</strong> is most often used to make comparisons partly because it is the series with which people are most familiar. This series tries to compare the cost of things the average household buys such as food, housing,
            transportation, medical services, etc. For earlier years, it is the most useful series for comparing the cost of consumer goods and services. It can be interpreted as how much money you would need today to buy an item in the year
            in question if its price had changed the same percentage as the average price change.                        <ul>

                        The<b> GDP Deflator</b> is similar to the CPI in that it is a measure of average prices. The &quot;bundle&quot; of goods and services here includes all things produced in the economy, not just consumer goods and services that are reflected

    of the members of the unit. During the 20th century, this measure grew faster than per capita income because the average size of the consumer unit decreased during that time.  The bundle increases over time as household income increases. Unlike the CPI, not only the cost, but also the amount of goods and services increases over time. <br><em>This number is not published until September each year, so the value use here is estimated until then. </em>                        <ul>

    to earn its cost. This index can also be useful in comparing different wages over time. The unskilled wage is a more consistent measure than the average wage for making comparisons over time. This is because the average wage
    changes both because of changes in the composition of skills in the workforce as well as the general cost of labor. The level of skills of the unskilled is assumed to stay the same.                        <ul>

    would include blue-collar workers, hourly rated workers, or non-office workers. Unlike the unskilled wage, this series includes both money earnings and benefits. During the last third of the 20th century, benefits grew to be close
    to 25% of the compensation.                        <ul>

                        <p>
                            <strong>George Washington</strong> was paid a salary of $25,000 a year from 1789 to 1797 as the first president
of the United States. The current salary of the president is now $400,000, to go with a $169,000
expense account, a generous pension and several other benefits. Has the remuneration improved?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Making a comparison using the CPI for 1790 shows that $25,000 corresponds to about $836,000
today, so current presidents do not have an equal command over consumer goods as the Father of
the Country. (Of course, Washington had to travel by horse drawn carriage, not helicopters or Air
Force One.)

                        <p>
                        When comparing Washington&#39;s salary to an unskilled worker, or the measure of average income,
GDP per capita, then the comparable numbers are $16 to $38 million. Granted that would not put
him in the ranks of the top 25 executives today that make over $200 million. It would, however,
be many times more than any elected official in this country is <u>paid</u> today. Finally, to show the
&quot;economic power&quot; of his wage, we see that his salary as a share of GDP would rank him equivalent
to $3.04 billion.

                            <strong>The Erie Canal</strong> was built between 1817 and 1825 for a price of $7 million. This waterway is
regarded as one of the most important investments in the nineteenth century as it opened the
Midwest to trade and migration. How does its cost compare to what its cost would be today?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Using the GDP deflator for 1825 shows that it would be $207 million, not more than the cost today
of a few miles of Interstate highway. Using the unskilled wage measure the cost is $2.4 billion.
From a historical point of view, this may be the best measure as most of the cost of building the
canal was probably unskilled labor. Using the manufacturing workers index gives us a much higher
cost of $4.9 billion.<br> Using the GDP per capita, the cost is close to $6.5 billion, and as a share of GDP, it comes in close
to $196 billion. As a comparison the current budget of the U.S. Department of transportation is
$142 billion.

                        <p>
                        Because of the volatility of prices in that period, if we had chosen 1817 instead of 1825, the GDP
deflator computation would have been $160 million or about 22% less and the other measures are
different by similar magnitudes as well. This is a good example of how &quot;approximate&quot; these
comparisons are.

                            <li><strong>The Civil War</strong> was one of the most devastating events in the history of the United States. It lasted
from 1861 to 1865 and has been estimated to have a direct cost of about $6.7 billion valued in 1860
dollars. If this number were evaluated in dollars of today using the GDP deflator it would be $168
billion, less than one-fourth of the current Department of Defense budget. This would be
inappropriate, as would be using the wage or income indexes. The only measure that makes sense for
an expenditure of this size is to use the share of GDP, as the war impacted the output of the entire
country. Thus the relative value of $6.7 billion of 1860 would be $35.1 trillion today, or over 150% of
our current GDP.
                                <p>The $6.7 billion does not take into account that the war disrupted the economy and had an impact of
lower production into the future. Some economic historians have estimated this additional, or indirect
cost, to be another $7.3 billion measured in 1860 dollars. This means the cost of the war (as a share
of the output of the economy) was nearly $73.4 trillion as measured in current dollars.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Model T Ford</strong> cost $850 in 1908; however, by 1925 the price had fallen to $290. How do we
compare these values? If you wanted to compare the two years you would see that by using the
CPI, the GDP deflator or the consumer bundle, $850 in 1908 is equivalent to a value between
$1,485 and $1,670 <u>in 1925</u>. Using the wage index we see that the labor cost (of the 1908 car in
1925 wages) was $2,094 and by using the GDP per capita index it was $1,957. Thus in 1925 the

$290 was less than 20% of its cost in 1908 using the price indexes and only 11 to 14% using the
wage indexes and 15% using the GDP per capita. </p>
                        <p>If we wanted to consider the costs of the Model T using today&#39;s prices we would find that the $850
cost in 1908 is $25,800 in today&#39;s prices using the CPI, $18,500 using the GDP deflator, about
$55,168 using the consumer bundle, $123,000 using the unskilled wage, $174,000 using the
manufacturing compensation, and $172,000 when comparing using the GDP per capita. At this
point the Ford was a luxury for most everyone. </p>
                        <p>The $290 in 1925, on the other hand, would be only $4,480 in today&#39;s prices using the CPI, $3,610
using the GDP deflator, $9,250 using the consumer bundle, $17,100 using the unskilled wage,
$19,200 using the manufacturing compensation, and $25,400 when comparing using the GDP per

than 14 times larger. This means that if we are interested in Ruth&#39;s purchasing power of housing or
meals, then he was &quot;earning&quot; the equivalence of about $1,420,000 today. </p>
                        <p>In 2021, the average consumer unit spends about 39 times in dollars more than it spent 82 years
earlier. Thus, if we want to compare Ruth&#39;s earnings using the index of what the average
household buys, it would be over $3,000,000 today. The relative cost of labor is 58 times
(unskilled) and 65 times (manufacturing production workers) higher in 2021 than in 1931. So if we
wanted to compare his wage to what someone selling hot dogs would earn, we could say his
&quot;relative wage&quot; is four to five million.</p>
                        <p>GDP per capita and GDP are 111 and 297 times larger in 2021 than they were in 1931. Thus,
Ruth&#39;s earnings relative to the average output would be $8,890,000 today. Finally, as a share of
GDP, Ruth&#39;s &quot;output&quot; that year would be $23,800,000 in today&#39;s money. As a comparison, the top
ten paid baseball players today make over $30 million. </p>

                        <p><strong>Putting a man on the moon:</strong> in March of 1966) NASA told Congress the &quot;run-out cost&quot; of the Apollo program (to put men on the moon) would be an estimated $22.718 billion for the 13 year program that accomplished
                            six successful missions of putting astronauts on the moon between July 1969 and December 1972. (
                            <a class='content' href='http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/keyev4.htm'>http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/keyev4.htm</a>) According to Steve Garber, NASA History Web Curator, the final cost was
                            between $20 and $25 billion. </p>
                        <p>How much would that be today? If we used the CPI, it would be $190 billion, but this would not be
a very good measure since the CPI does not reflect the cost of rockets and launch pads. Using the
consumer bundle would not be relevant either. Using the broader based GDP deflator gives a
present cost of $147 billion. An alternative would be to use the production worker index as a rough
measure of the labor cost in current terms and that would be $242 billion. By using the GDP per
capita, we are measuring the cost in terms of average product and would get a number of $380
billion. Finally, a way to consider the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; to society, the best measure might be the
cost as a percent of GDP, and that number would be $642 billion. This amount over thirteen years
would be $53.5 billion per year. As a comparison, the NASA budget for the current fiscal year is
approximately $24 billion.

                        <p><strong>The &quot;real&quot; price of gasoline</strong>: Gasoline cost 22 cents a gallon in 1929 compared to a (nominal)
peak of $5 .05 in June of 2022 (it had dropped since.) How has the relative cost of buying gas
changed over the last 90 years? Presented here are two tables computing the annual &quot;real&quot; cost
using our seven indexes, one <a href="#" class="content" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('2021.html','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=600')"> in 2021 dollars</a>, and the
                            other <a href="#" class="content" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('1929.html','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=600')"> in 1929 dollars</a>. While the two tables show the same trends, they do give a different perspective.</p>
                        <p>Using the 2021 table and the CPI and the GDP deflator, we see that gasoline was quite expensive
in 2012 and it was the cheapest in 1998. In 2021, the real price using these two measures is 80%
and 65% higher than in 1998 and 40% and 42% cheaper than 2012 . </p>
                        <p>By looking at the share of the Consumer Bundle and GDP per capita, the story is a bit different. In
1931, the “real” price of Gasoline was $3.11 using the CPI, however, a gallon of gas took as much
out of what the average consumer spent as $6.64 did in 2021. And as a share of GDP per capita,
gas was even more expensive in those earlier days as it was over $18.89 in 1931 and as much as
$7.15 in 1960.
                        </p>
                        <p>The other table tells the story in a different way. Let us look at relative cost to a worker to fill up
using 1929 dollars. That year the 21 cents it cost for a gallon of gas, took a certain share of the
worker&#39;s wage. The interesting question is, has the cost as a share or percent of the worker&#39;s wage
increased or decreased over time? The table shows that for the two wage rates and price of
gasoline in other years, this cost has fallen. Since wages have increased faster than the price of
gasoline, by 2021 both wage indexes show that workers spend less than one-fourth as much, as a
percent of wages, for a gallon of gasoline than the 1929 worker. The table shows that the $2.64 a
worker paid in 2021 would be comparable to 5 cents (in 1929 prices &quot;share&quot; of the wage.)</p>
                        <p>When we use the GDP per capita, the cost has fallen faster. Looking at the table shows that a
gallon of gasoline today costs around 4 cents a gallon (in 1929 prices) if measured as a &quot;share&quot; of
the GDP per capita. This is because in 1929, 21 cents was 0.44% of per capita GDP, while in 2021,
$3.01 was 0.004%. </p>
                        <p>Finally, comparing its cost as a share of GDP, we see that for 2021 (in 1929 prices), it is about 1
cent. This means that a gallon of gasoline was over 21 times larger as a share of output in 1929
than it is today. </p>

                         Price is for Regular Leaded Gasoline until 1990 and for Regular Unleaded Gasoline thereafter.<br><a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/index.php?tbl=T09.04#/?f=A&start=1949&end=2020&charted=5-10-11">Source for Gas prices.</a>

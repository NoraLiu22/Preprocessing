			<h2>Executive Summary </h2>
			<p>This report reviews legal aspects of Russia’s invasion into Georgia in August 2008 and Russia’s recognition of Georgia’s separatist enclaves’ independence.  The report includes an analysis of  relevant aspects of international law  and Russian domestic law, as well as an evaluation of Russia’s legal justification for its actions.  The report also provides historic background of the conflict and commentaries on laws regarding the deployment of the Russian military abroad. (<a href="russian-georgia-war.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>, 130KB)</p>
			<a id="Introduction"></a>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>On  September 8, 2008, the International Court of Justice began considering a case  submitted by the Republic of Georgia against the Russian Federation accusing it  of breaching the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms  of Racial Discrimination and of conducting "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140716042951/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14661.pdf" class="external" target="_blank">violent discriminatory acts<span> (external link)</span></a>" (PDF) by armed  forces in concert with separatist militia and foreign mercenaries.”<a name="t1" id="t1"></a>[<a href="#f1">1</a>]  This is the first time that Russia or the former  Soviet Union, the country that ceased to exist in 1991 and to which Russia is a  legal successor, has been called before this principal judicial body of the  United Nations.  The submission of the  claim followed the August 8, 2008,  invasion by Russian military forces of sovereign Georgian territory, Russia’s  attempt to change the borders of this independent country,<a name="t2" id="t2"></a>[<a href="#f2">2</a>] and the strengthening of the Russian military and political presence in the  Georgian province of South    Ossetia. </p>
			<p class="backtotop"><a href="#skip_menu">Back to Top</a></p>
			<a name="Historic Background of the Conflict"></a>
			<h2>Historic Background of the Conflict</h2>
			<p>Ossetians are an  ethnic Iranian group that became Christian in the early Middle Ages under  Georgian and Byzantine influence.  A  consolidated Ossetian Kingdom was created in the eighth century A.D., but in  the thirteenth century, having been driven out by invading Mongols, they  arrived from the north to the area where they now reside, establishing large  Ossetian communities in Georgia.  After  the Soviet troops occupied Georgia  in 1921 and included it in the Soviet Union as a  constituent republic, the South Ossetian Autonomous District was established in  1922 in the territory of the Central Province of Georgia.  Some argue that this was granted by the  Bolsheviks to the Ossetians in return for their assistance in fighting against a  democratic Georgia  and favoring local separatists, because this territory had never been a  separate principality before.<a name="t3" id="t3"></a>[<a href="#f3">3</a>]  A similar North Ossetian Autonomous District  was created within the Russian Federation,  dividing an established ethnic group by a state border.  Regardless of active ethnic interaction  during the Soviet period, many all-Georgian villages existed in South   Ossetia, and the Ossetian population was mainly concentrated in  the towns of Tskhinvali and Java.  In the  early 1990s (before the recent conflicts), two-thirds of the region’s  population was Ossetian and one-third Georgian, while about 100,000 ethnic  Ossetians continued to live in Georgia outside the South Ossetian region.<a name="t4" id="t4"></a>[<a href="#f4">4</a>]</p>
			<p>In the 1990s, a  secession movement supported by the Russian government was initiated in South   Ossetia.  The intent was to  unite the province with Russian North Ossetia.<a name="t5" id="t5"></a>[<a href="#f5">5</a>]  Georgian actions aimed at returning the region  to Tbilisi’s control triggered a  conflict in which 2,000 to 4,000 people were killed.<a name="t6" id="t6"></a>[<a href="#f6">6</a>]  Pursuant to a Russian-brokered ceasefire and  agreements concluded in June 1992, Russian, Georgian, and Ossetian peacekeeping  units totaling 1,100 men established their camp near Tskhinvali, the capital of  South Ossetia.<a name="t7" id="t7"></a>[<a href="#f7">7</a>]  President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia  attempted to increase border control and limit smuggling operations in the  region.  He also sent police, military,  and intelligence personnel into the region.  In response, Russia  sent several hundred paramilitary elements and reinforced South Ossetian  authorities with Russian high-level law enforcement officials.<a name="t8" id="t8"></a>[<a href="#f8">8</a>]</p>
			<p>Regardless of  the different peace plans proposed by Georgian authorities, in November 2006, a  popular referendum was held in South Ossetia to reaffirm  its independence from Georgia.  Ninety-nine percent of voters supported the  referendum.<a name="t9" id="t9"></a>[<a href="#f9">9</a>]  In response, the Russian authorities actively  started to grant Russian citizenship to South Ossetians  and to issue them Russian passports.</p>
			<p>On April 16, 2008,  then Russian President  Vladimir Putin issued a Decree ordering his Cabinet to establish “special  relationships” with the South Ossetian government and to open a representative  office of the Russian Foreign Ministry in Tskhinvali.<a name="t10" id="t10"></a>[<a href="#f10">10</a>]  This act <em>de  facto</em> recognized the independence of South Ossetia from Georgia and was  used by the South Ossetian authorities, which were under protection of the  Russian forces, as permission to initiate the expulsion of ethnic Georgians  from the territory of South Ossetia.  On  August 1 and 2, 2008, ethnic Georgian villages in the territory of the South  Ossetian Autonomous District were bombarded by the South Ossetian paramilitary  self-defense force.  With the purpose of  protecting the population and restoring law and order in South Ossetia, Georgian troops were brought to the territory of  this autonomous district on August 7, 2008.  The next day,  active units of the Russian Armed Forces invaded Georgia, destroying its military, transportation, and  economic infrastructure within and outside of the South Ossetian territory.  The necessity of defending Russian citizens  living in South Ossetia from Georgian military attacks was cited as the  justification for Russian actions.  After  completing the military occupation of the Georgian province of South Ossetia, expelling  Georgians and Georgian authorities from the region, and securing the pro-Russian  government of South Ossetia, the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry  Medvedev, issued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140716042951/http://document.kremlin.ru/doc.asp?ID=047560">decrees</a> on the recognition of state independence of the Republic  of South Ossetia,<a name="t11" id="t11"></a>[<a href="#f11">11</a>] raising  questions about the possible annexation of this Georgian land by Russia in the  future.<a name="t12" id="t12"></a>[<a href="#f12">12</a>]
			
			<p class="backtotop"><a href="#skip_menu">Back to Top</a></p>
			<a id="Laws on the Use of the Russian Military Abroad"></a>
			<h2>Laws on the Use of the Russian Military Abroad</h2>
			<p>Under the Russian  Constitution, the President is the Commander in Chief, but declarations of war  and control over the presidential right to use armed forces outside of Russian  territory are prerogatives of the legislature.<a name="t13" id="t13"></a>[<a href="#f13">13</a>]  Article 81 of the Russian Constitution states  that a war can be declared only in the event of aggression against Russia  or the immediate threat of aggression.  Citing  article 51 of the United Nations (U.N.) Charter, which provides for the state’s  right of self-defense, the Russian Federal Constitutional Law on Martial Law  (art. 3.2) defines aggression against Russia as a foreign military invasion or  an attack on Russian territory, or occupation or annexation; the blockade of  ports or shoreline, bombardment of territory, or application of other warfare  against Russia or its military personnel regardless of their location; or the  supply of militias and mercenaries by a foreign state, or providing its own  territory to a third party for an attack on Russia.<a name="t14" id="t14"></a>[<a href="#f14">14</a>]  In the case of such aggression, the President  shall declare martial law, order the armed forces to start combat actions, and  immediately notify both chambers of the Federal Assembly (the Russian  legislature), which is required to pass an appropriate law within 48  hours.  If the Presidential decree on  martial law is not approved, the Federation Council (the upper chamber of the  legislature) invalidates the Decree, which shall be considered void.<a name="t15" id="t15"></a>[<a href="#f15">15</a>]  </p>
			<p>The authority to deploy Russian armed forces abroad is prescribed similarly.  The Constitution empowers the Federation  Council to permit the use of the armed forces  abroad, upon the request of the Russian Federation President.  The President’s request for parliamentary  approval for the use of Russian armed forces in foreign countries is required  for each instance of sending Russian troops abroad and is to be accompanied by  a timetable with a defined date for the full return of Russian troops from  abroad.  If the operation is prolonged,  or if it is impossible to meet the deadline for the return of troops, an  additional presidential request to the Federation Council and a new  parliamentary approval are required.<a name="t16" id="t16"></a>[<a href="#f16">16</a>]</p>
			<p>On July 7, 2006, the upper chamber of the  Russian legislature unanimously passed a resolution entitled “On Using  Formations of Armed Forces of the Russian    Federation and Special Purpose Detachments  Outside the Territory of the Russian Federation With the Purpose of Preventing  International Terrorist Activities.”<a name="t17" id="t17"></a>[<a href="#f17">17</a>]  The adoption of this Resolution appears to  accord with the constitutional requirement of parliamentary control over the  presidential right to use armed forces abroad.  The Resolution applied the constitutional  definition of armed forces to all Russian military personnel and permitted the  President to send abroad any person in uniform, even those who were not  officially considered to be a part of the Russian    Federation armed forces and were prohibited  from involvement in operations abroad pursuant to the Federal Antiterrorism  Law.<a name="t18" id="t18"></a>[<a href="#f18">18</a>]</p>
			<p>In Russia,  the regular military consists of the armed forces under the Ministry of  Defense.  However, according to the  Constitution, the uniformed services of the Russian Federation subordinated to  the President include the troops of the Federal Security Service (the former  KGB), internal troops (analogous to the U.S. National Guard), and troops of the  Ministry for Emergency Management.   Officers of these troops are subject to all Russian military laws and  regulations.  Following the  constitutional interpretation, the use of any military personnel abroad is  subject to parliamentary approval and control, similar to those approvals necessary  for the use of regular armed forces abroad.</p>
			<p>Additionally, in response to the President’s proposal, the legislators  stated that this Resolution would be in force indefinitely during the entire  period of time needed to eliminate the threat of a terrorist act abroad against  Russia or its  citizens, or against stateless individuals permanently residing in Russia.   It appears that, despite the fact that the  approval of each use of Russian armed forces abroad is under the exclusive  jurisdiction of the upper chamber of the Russian legislature, the 2006  Resolution freed operations abroad from parliamentary control and allowed the  President independently to use the Russian military abroad and without time  restrictions, as long as use of the military is justified by antiterrorist  goals.
			
			<p>Federal Law No. 93 of 1995 on the Procedure of Providing Civil and  Military Personnel for Operations to Restore International Peace and Security  regulates the participation of Russian military personnel in peacekeeping  operations.<a name="t19" id="t19"></a>[<a href="#f19">19</a>]  The Law defines general issues regarding parliamentary  control over the decision to send Russian peacekeeping units for international  operations and establishes the rules of recruiting, training, and sustaining  the activities of members of these peacekeeping units.  A separate provision prohibits the service of  draftees abroad as well as their participation in military operations,  including peacekeeping operations, leaving this duty to professional officers  and volunteers.</p>

			<a id="Legal Grounds for the Russian Military Presence in Georgia"></a>
			<h2>Legal Grounds for the Russian Military Presence in Georgia</h2>
			<h3>Military Bases</h3>
			<p>After the  dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia  became the legal successor to the Soviet Union and  inherited the former Soviet armed forces.   Military units located outside of Russia  in other constituent Soviet republics were divided between Russia  and those republics according to bilateral agreements.  Many military units that were transferred  under Russia’s  jurisdiction remained in their regular locations and were transformed into  Russian military bases.  In Georgia,  Russia had four  military bases.  The agreement on terms of  the bases’ closure, their transfer under Georgian jurisdiction, and the exit of  Russian troops from Georgia  was ratified by the Russian legislature on October 13, 2006.<a name="t20" id="t20"></a>[<a href="#f20">20</a>]  The last Russian military base was closed in  2007, and troops were removed to Russian territory, except for those units that  were involved in the peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia and South   Ossetia.</p>
			<h3>Presence in Abkhazia</h3>
			<p>Russian  individual and paramilitary units were actively involved in the military  conflict in Abkhazia in its initial stages.   Russian volunteers from Chechnya  and other Russian North Caucasus provinces were involved  in ethnic cleansing against the Georgian population in Abkhazia and in combat  actions against regular Georgian forces.<a name="t21" id="t21"></a>[<a href="#f21">21</a>]  The formal presence of Russian troops in the  zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict was sanctioned by the President of the  Russian Federation, who on June 9, 1994, issued a decree<a name="t22" id="t22"></a>[<a href="#f22">22</a>] aimed at implementing the decision made by the heads of the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS) Member States<a name="t23" id="t23"></a>[<a href="#f23">23</a>] to  conduct an operation to secure peace in Abkhazia.  Despite the fact that at this time there was  no legal requirement for parliamentary approval of participation in  peacekeeping operations,<a name="t24" id="t24"></a>[<a href="#f24">24</a>] the President submitted his decree to the Federation Council for  confirmation.  The decree was not  confirmed but a special parliamentary resolution permitted the formation of the  peacekeeping force.<a name="t25" id="t25"></a>[<a href="#f25">25</a>]  After a series of decrees issued by President  Yeltsin, which extended the term of the peacekeeping force’s tour of duty,<a name="t26" id="t26"></a>[<a href="#f26">26</a>] in  2003, the Federation Council expressed its agreement with having the Russian  military force remain in Abkhazia until full completion of the peacekeeping  operation, upon the request of one of the parties involved (Russia,  Georgia, and  Abkhazia). </p>
			<h3>Military Involvement in South Ossetia</h3>
			<p>Initially, the  military contingent in South Ossetia consisted of two  Soviet regiments, which were transferred under Russian jurisdiction after the  breakup of the Soviet Union.  These troops were withdrawn from South   Ossetia in July 1992, and were replaced by the Russian  peacekeeping unit following the conclusion of the Agreement on Principles of  the Resolution of the Georgian-Ossetian Conflict in the Russian city of Sochi  on June 24, 1992.<a name="t27" id="t27"></a>[<a href="#f27">27</a>]  The Agreement was signed by the presidents of  Russia and Georgia,  and leaders of the Autonomous Province of South  Ossetia within the Republic of Georgia,with the  purpose of stopping military hostilities in the region by establishing a  three-part peacekeeping force consisting of Georgian, Russian, and South  Ossetian components.  In order to prevent  the possibility of Russian military involvement in the conflict, article 2 of  the Agreement specified the demilitarization of the conflict zone and provided  for the removal of all Russian troops not included in the peacekeeping force from  the territory of South    Ossetia within twenty days.  In addition, all South Ossetian  self-defense forces were to be disbanded immediately.</p>
			<p>The Agreement emphasized the ban on combat actions  and stated that the role of the peacekeeping force was to stop activities of  all military formations that were not controlled by the parties to the  Agreement and to prevent any subsequent conflicts, including military conflicts.  The peacekeepers were commanded by  the  force commander and were supposed to eliminate military groups that violated  the regime of the conflict zone, using only their own munitions.  Outside of the conflict zone, the peacekeepers  were not allowed to conduct operations but they could assist Georgian law  enforcement authorities in apprehending unlawful combatants.  No law authorized Russian military  actions or even presence, peacekeeping or otherwise, on Georgian territory  outside the conflict zone.<a name="t28" id="t28"></a>[<a href="#f28">28</a>]</p>
			<p>Denouncing economic sanctions and blockades against South Ossetia,  the Agreement declared the right of free movement of goods, services, and  people, eliminating border and customs controls between South Ossetia  and the rest of the Georgian territory.  A  Control Commission was established to monitor the activities of the  peacekeeping force.  In October 1994, the newly adopted Statute on the Control  Commission added the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Mission in Georgia to the list of the Commission members and extended the  scope of the Commission’s duties to include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Coordination  of the activities of the peacekeeping forces;</li>
				<li>Elaboration and implementation of measures aimed at resolving political, military,  law enforcement, economic, humanitarian, information, and other problems;</li>
				<li>Developing  a dialogue between the parties involved;</li>
				<li>Participation  in the return of and assistance to refugees and other displaced persons;</li>
				<li>Economic  restoration of the conflict zone; and</li>
				<li>Monitoring  human rights and protecting national minorities in the conflict zone.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Although the goal of the Agreement was to prevent any possibility of involvement of  Russian Armed Forces in the conflict (art. 2), it was cited by  Russian President Medvedev as the legal foundation for Russian military  involvement in the conflict when he publicly announced the military incursion  into Georgia on August 8, 2008.<a name="t29" id="t29"></a>[<a href="#f29">29</a>] This argument appears to be overstated because the  Agreement did not foresee the possibility of urgent unilateral reinforcement of  the peacekeeping force and did not allow for the use of regular military units  for peacekeeping purposes on South Ossetian territory.  Although the peacekeeping force in South   Ossetia was sanctioned by the joint authorities of the CIS,  no decision of the CIS  authorized Russia  to apply military force on the territory of a foreign state.  Moreover, since Georgia  withdrew from the CIS on August   13, 2008, and denounced its multilateral obligations under the CIS  agreements at the time, Russia’s  continued application of the CIS framework to South Ossetian conflict  resolution would appear to be suspect and the status of the peacekeeping forces  should be reviewed.  Expulsion of the Georgian  contingent of the peacekeeping force from the South Ossetian territory and the exclusion  of Georgia from  the conflict resolution process appears to be another violation of the 1992  Agreement.</p>
			<p>The use of  Russian armed forces in South Ossetia also appears to contradict  Russian domestic military legislation.   The legislature was not informed by the nation’s President about the use  of the Russian military in combat actions abroad, and the operation was not  approved by the legislature, as is required by the Constitution and other  federal laws.  Although no formal legal  statement was announced, the spokesperson of the Federation Council explained  that Resolution No. 219 of July 2006, which allows the president to use armed  forces abroad at any time to fight terrorists, is not applicable in this  situation because the military operation in South Ossetia  was not aimed at fighting international terrorists.<a name="t30" id="t30"></a>[<a href="#f30">30</a>]  Legal uncertainties related to the violation  of peacekeeping operation conditions and the absence of a proper war-related  parliamentary resolution raised other legal questions,  such as the status of war prisoners, or the use of conscripts in combat  operations abroad, which is prohibited by Russian law, and forcing draftees to  conclude military service contracts.<a name="t31" id="t31"></a>[<a href="#f31">31</a>]</p>
			<h3>International Law and Operations  in South Ossetia</h3>
			<p>On August 8, 2008, the President of  Russia characterized the Georgian attack on the South Ossetian town of Tskhinvali  and surrounding areas as &quot;an act of aggression,&quot; and stated that Russia’s  involvement was an act of providing assistance to defend against the attacking  Georgian troops.<a name="t32" id="t32"></a>[<a href="#f32">32</a>]  However, an act of aggression can be  recognized by the U.N. Security Council only upon evaluation of all the circumstances  surrounding a military incursion.  Moreover,  an act of aggression requires use of the armed forces of a state against the  sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of another state.<a name="t33" id="t33"></a>[<a href="#f33">33</a>] Similarly, military assistance in the form of  self-defense can be provided to another state only pursuant to formal  agreements on this issue.  None of these  requirements was met in the events of August   8, 2008.  Despite the fact  that South Ossetia declared its independence from Georgia, it had not achieved the status of an internationally recognized independent state. On August 8, 2008, South Ossetia remained an  integral part of Georgian territory, which excludes the possibility of Georgian  aggression against South Ossetia and undermines the use of this international  law principle in as justification for Russia’s action.</p>
			<p>International  law may deem the use of force lawful when it is justified by the principle of  necessity, even if under other circumstances such actions would be considered  illegal.  However, in this case,  according to the International Court of Justice, the interested state cannot be  the only party that decides whether the requirement of necessity was met or  not.<a name="t34" id="t34"></a>[<a href="#f34">34</a>]  If Russia wants to use this argument, it must prove  to the international community that the military occupation of South Ossetia  and the remaining Georgian territory was the reasonable, proportionate, and only  possible response to damage inflicted on Russia, its citizens, and their  property, as required under the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140716042951/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm" class="external" target="_blank">Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of  War on Land<span> (external link)</span></a> (Hague IV), Oct. 18, 1907.<a name="t35" id="t35"></a>[<a href="#f35">35</a>]  In this case, Russia has to prove that its  troops were fighting not Georgian individuals, but units of the Georgian armed  forces; that military but not civilian infrastructure was the subject of the  Russian attack; that it targeted warfare but not means of public and private  transport; that it attempted to prevent the enemy’s ability to resist but did not  indiscriminately kill Georgian soldiers; and that it provided humane treatment  for the wounded and prisoners.</p>
			<p>Because the  separatist territories were not recognized by anyone on the day the war  started, Russia  cannot characterize its actions as providing military and defense  assistance.  The only possible  justification could be the outdated Soviet doctrine of international law, which  recognized the right to use arms in the fight for national liberation and state  independence if no other choice was left to the striving people.  Under the Soviet concept, such people were  subjects of public international law and the right to self-defense was  applicable to them.<a name="t36" id="t36"></a>[<a href="#f36">36</a>]</p>

			<a id="Russia’s “Protection of Citizens” Justification"></a>
			<h2>Russia’s “Protection of Citizens” Justification</h2>
			<h3>Justification of Military Use</h3>
			<p>When Russia  attacked Georgia, the highest Russian officials justified the operation by pointing  to the need to protect Russian citizens living in South Ossetia from what  Moscow’s leaders chose to call “genocide” by the Georgian army in South Ossetia,<a name="t37" id="t37"></a>[<a href="#f37">37</a>] purporting  to follow the internationally accepted mode of behavior when governments must  protect their citizens using military means, if necessary.<a name="t38" id="t38"></a>[<a href="#f38">38</a>]</p>
			<p>The first  attempt to interpret Russian military actions as necessary protection of its fellow  citizens and to explain the legality of involvement in a military  operation abroad was made on August 13, 2008, by the Chairman and Chief Justice  of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, Valery Zorkin, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140716042951/http:// www.rg.ru/2008/08/13/zorkin.html" class="external" target="_blank">published<span> (external link)</span></a> his own interpretation of article 61 of the Russian Constitution,  which provides for the protection of Russian citizens outside of the country,  in the official government-owned daily newspaper, <em>Rossiiskaia Gazeta</em>.<a name="t39" id="t39"></a>[<a href="#f39">39</a>]  According to Chief Justice Zorkin, it is  absolutely legal for a sovereign state to apply the full force of its military  and destroy the armed forces of a foreign state if the goal of such an  operation is to secure the lives of its compatriots  who are permanently living abroad, in the case of a military conflict on the  foreign territory where they reside.<a name="t40" id="t40"></a>[<a href="#f40">40</a>]  He stated that the peace enforcement operation  conducted by the Russian military in South Ossetia was in accordance with  article 14.5 of the Russian Federal Law on the State Policy in Regard to the  Fellow Citizens Residing Abroad, which provides that, if a foreign state  violates recognized norms of international law and human rights in regard to  Russian expatriates, the Russian Federation shall undertake efforts authorized by  international law to defend their interests.<a name="t41" id="t41"></a>[<a href="#f41">41</a>]  Zorkin concluded that, by invading Georgia,  Russia  fulfilled its obligations to its fellow citizens.<a name="t42" id="t42"></a>[<a href="#f42">42</a>]</p>
			<p>Chief Justice  Zorkin’s explanations excluded a diplomatic solution and did not consider the  legality of military actions on the territory of a foreign state, where such  actions are not sanctioned by an international body.  Also, he did not take into account two major  facts associated with the presence of Russian citizens on the Georgian  territory.  The first is that the large  population of Russian nationals was created artificially by handing Russian  citizenship to residents of Georgian separatist regions, the policy that was  conducted during the last ten years with the purpose of weakening Georgia’s  sovereignty.<a name="t43" id="t43"></a>[<a href="#f43">43</a>]  The second important fact is that South   Ossetians who recently became Russian citizens were not merely individuals  living in a foreign country but were actively engaged in creating their own  independent state within the territory of another country.</p>
			<h3>Russian Passport Policy in South Ossetia</h3>
			<p>In the Republic   of Georgia and in the Russian    Federation, issues of citizenship are  regulated by laws on citizenship.  The Georgian  Law on Citizenship was adopted on March   25, 1993.<a name="t44" id="t44"></a>[<a href="#f44">44</a>]  The Law on Citizenship of the Russian    Federation was passed on May 31, 2002.<a name="t45" id="t45"></a>[<a href="#f45">45</a>]  Neither act recognizes dual citizenship  nor states that an individual who is a citizen of one of these countries can  be a citizen of another country.  In Russia,  possession of foreign citizenship neither entails legal consequences nor  affects one’s legal status, except in particular instances specified by law.  Under article 32 of the Georgian Citizenship  Law, the citizenship of an individual who has acquired foreign citizenship  shall be terminated.  Both laws state  that the main document identifying one’s citizenship is the nation’s  passport.  Possession of a passport from Georgia  or Russia is  proof of admission to Georgian or Russian citizenship, respectively.</p>
			<p>Both, Russian  and Georgian citizenship laws are based on the principle of permanent residency  during a specified period of time in the territory of the state before the  Citizenship Law entered into force.  Both  laws provide for the possibility of acquiring citizenship following special  procedures if the established requirements are met.  Before 2002, Russian law allowed residents of  former Soviet republics to apply for citizenship if they had not become  citizens of their newly independent states.   The procedure was extremely complex and required repeated trips to  Russian consular offices or relocating to Russia.   However, the new Citizenship Law of  Russia introduced a simplified procedure of citizenship acquisition for former  citizens of the Soviet Union regardless of their place  of residence, if they reside in the former Soviet republics and were not able  to acquire citizenship from those republics and remain stateless  individuals.  Those individuals are  admitted to Russian citizenship upon submission of a written petition to a  Russian consular office in the republic of their permanent residency.  They receive Russian travel passports as a  proof of their Russian citizenship.</p>
			<p>In Abkhazia and South   Ossetia the application process was simplified even further, and  people could apply even without leaving their homes.  Russian nationalist non-governmental  organizations with close ties to Russian officialdom simply took their papers  to a nearby Russian city for processing.  Reportedly, following this regulation, up to  90 percent of South Ossetia’s population of under  100,000 used this opportunity to acquire Russian citizenship,<a name="t46" id="t46"></a>[<a href="#f46">46</a>] and a special series of Russian travel passports was designated for issuance in  South Ossetia.   Relocation to the Russian territory is not required for former Soviet  citizens in order to obtain Russian citizenship; however, according to the Russian  Citizenship Law (art. 14.4), all citizens of the former Soviet Union who  registered their residence in Russia on or before July 1, 2002, were eligible  for automatic acquisition of Russian citizenship if they expressed such  intention before January 1, 2008.  The relatives  of such individuals who arrived in Russia  later are also eligible for a simplified citizenship acquisition procedure.</p>
			<p> In 2006, the separatist Republic of South    Ossetia,  which is  a part of the Republic of Georgia, passed its own Citizenship Law, that provides in art.  6.1 for the right of South   Ossetians to acquire Russian citizenship in addition to  their domestic South Ossetian citizenship; however, this law was not recognized  by the Georgian authorities.  According  to media reports, about 64,000 people had received South Ossetian passports,  which serve as domestic identification cards, by the end of 2006.<a name="t47" id="t47"></a>[<a href="#f47">47</a>]  This move does not change their  status because South Ossetia is not recognized as an independent state and its  passports are not considered to be valid documents by the Georgian  authorities.

			<a id="Legal"></a>
			<h2>Legal Justification and Consequences of Recognizing the Independence of Separatists</h2>
			<h3>Russian Attempts to Justify  Recognition</h3>
			<p>On August 26, 2008, after both chambers  of the Russian legislature submitted to Russian President Medvedev their  recommendations to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia  as independent states, he signed official decrees on recognition.<a name="t48" id="t48"></a>[<a href="#f48">48</a>]  The Chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian    Federation (the upper chamber of the  legislature) explained the legality of such recommendations by reference to a  former Soviet law, which allowed a constituent republic to leave the Soviet   Union after conducting a secession referendum.  According to him, the fact that Abkhazia and South   Ossetia did not have individual referendums while they were  autonomous republics within Georgia  preserves their former Soviet status, separates them from independent Georgia,  and makes them subjects of international law and sovereign states.<a name="t49" id="t49"></a>[<a href="#f49">49</a>]  If this logic were followed, the constituent  components of the Russian Federation,  which did not participate in the all-Russian referendums, should also be  recognized as independent states. </p>
			<p>Russian  documents on the recognition of South Ossetian and Abkhazian state independence  cite the U.N. General Assembly Declaration on Principles of International Law  Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States (Resolution 2625),  of October 24, 1970,<a name="t50" id="t50"></a>[<a href="#f50">50</a>] as  legal grounds for recognition.  This Declaration,  to which Russia  is a signatory, imposes on all participating states the obligation to refrain  from the use of force against other states and requires the states to settle  international disputes by peaceful means.  It provides that international relations shall  be based on every state refraining from any action aimed at the partial or  total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of any other  state or country, and in this regard the Declaration seems to be at odds with Russian  actions in Georgia.   The principle of self-determination by the  people, which was used by the Russian authorities, shall apply under international  law, according to the Declaration, but the document emphasizes that this  principle shall be applied with the purpose of bringing about the speedy end of  colonialism and securing orderly disbandment of colonial empires.  That was the goal of introducing the  principle of sovereign equality of the states.  Because Georgia  never had a colonial relationship with the separatist territories, the  application of this Declaration to justify the recognition of South Ossetian  and Abkhazian state independence does not seem to be appropriate.</p>
			<h3>Legal Consequences of  Recognition</h3>
			<p>Regardless of  the fact of formal state recognition of Abkhazian and South Ossetian  independence by Russia  and Nicaragua,  it appears that this act has no legal consequences for the parties involved.  After World War II, all international  recognition of a state’s sovereignty is conducted by the United Nations, which  includes almost all existing state formations.  The decision to accept a state to the United  Nations is made by the General Assembly after the Security Council agrees with  the proposal.  The Kosovo case  demonstrated that the unwillingness of even one Security Council member state  to accept the newly established country may extend the recognition process for an  indefinitely long period.</p>
			<p>Because the independence  of South Ossetia and Abkhazia was recognized only by Russia  and Nicaragua, Russia  may find itself in a situation similar to that of Turkey  in Northern Cyprus, where Turkish troops were deployed nine  years before the unilateral declaration of Northern Cyprus’  independence in 1983.  Since then, no  country has recognized the sovereignty of this territory except for Turkey,  which holds its troops in Northern Cyprus under a treaty  concluded with the authorities of this self-proclaimed republic.  The international community views Turkish  presence there as an occupation, and the United Nations regularly adopts  resolutions that call for non-recognition of this territory.<a name="t51" id="t51"></a>[<a href="#f1">51</a>] </p>
			<h3>Threats of Russian Sanctions Against  Non-Supportive States</h3>
			<p> On September 1, 2008, during a TV interview broadcast nationwide, Russian  President Medvedev suggested the possibility of introducing sanctions against those  states that take an unfriendly position toward Russia because of the war in Georgia.<a name="t52" id="t52"></a>[<a href="#f52">52</a>]  Russia has no previous experience in introducing sanctions  against a foreign state,<a name="t53" id="t53"></a>[<a href="#f53">53</a>] although it passed the Federal Law on Special Economic Measures on December 30, 2006, which allows the head of the Russian state to impose  financial and economic restrictions against foreign countries.<a name="t54" id="t54"></a>[<a href="#f54">54</a>]  If implemented, this law may limit scientific,  humanitarian, or tourist cooperation, or other economic measures may be  introduced at the discretion of the President upon informing the Federal  Assembly of this decision.  According to  the law, such measures can be introduced when an immediate reaction is required  to respond to actions of a foreign state that violate international law or  threaten Russia’s security or the rights of its citizens.  Because the law does not provide for measures  against foreign legal entities or individuals, and cannot affect the issue of  migration, which is of significant importance in Russo-Georgian relations,  amendments to this law were recently introduced in the Russian State Duma (the lower  house of the legislature) to address these matters.<a name="t55" id="t55"></a>[<a href="#f55">55</a>]
			
			<p class="backtotop"><a href="#skip_menu">Back to Top</a></p>
			<a id="Concluding Remarks"></a>
			<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
			<p>An analysis of Russian and  international law, as well as the review of how the “peace enforcement  operation” was conducted by Russia in Georgia in August 2008, leads one to  conclude that no international or domestic legal act can justify the Russian  military invasion of the sovereign territory of the Republic of Georgia, or the  recognition of the self-proclaimed independence of Georgian separatist regions  by the Russian Federation.  It appears  that these actions were conducted in violation of major international law  principles and Russian national legislation.   By siding with the separatists, Russia  automatically became a party to the conflict and made it impossible for itself  to be an arbiter or a peacekeeper in this conflict, thereby decreasing its role  in future negotiations on the status of these provinces.<a name="t56" id="t56"></a>[<a href="#f56">56</a>]  Treaties signed by Russia  with separatist provinces cannot be recognized because these territories are  not recognized as states, which may make Russian activities aimed at fulfilling  Russia’s  obligations under these treaties illegal.  Russia’s  military deployed in the regions may be recognized as an occupational force and  Russia may be  forced to withdraw its armed forces from the territory   of Georgia.</p>

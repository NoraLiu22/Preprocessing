    THE REVOLUTIONARY UNITED FRONT OF SIERRA LEONE</p>
  <p align="center">THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE and<br />
    THE REVOLUTIONARY UNITED FRONT OF SIERRA LEONE (RUF/SL)</p>

  <p>Recalling earlier initiatives undertaken by the countries of the          sub-region and the International Community, aimed at bringing about a          negotiated settlement of the conflict in Sierra Leone, and culminating          in the Abidjan Peace Agreement of 30 November, 1996 and the ECOWAS Peace          Plan of 23 October, 1997;</p>
  <p>Moved by the imperative need to meet the desire of the people of          Sierra Leone for a definitive settlement of the fratricidal war in their          country and for genuine national unity and reconciliation;</p>
  <p align="justify">Committed to promoting full respect for human rights          and humanitarian law;</p>

  <p align="justify">Recognising the imperative that the children of          Sierra Leone, especially those affected by armed conflict, in view of          their vulnerability, are entitled to special care and the protection of          their inherent right to life, survival and development, in accordance          with the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of the          Child;</p>
  <p align="justify">Guided by the Declaration in the Final CommuniquÃ© of          the Meeting in Lome of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of ECOWAS of 25          May 1999, in which they stressed the importance of democracy as a factor          of regional peace and security, and as essential to the socio-economic          development of ECOWAS Member States; and in which they pledged their          commitment to the consolidation of democracy and respect of human rights          while reaffirming the need for all Member States to consolidate their          democratic base, observe the principles of good governance and good          economic management in order to ensure the emergence and development of          a democratic culture which takes into account the interests of the          peoples of West Africa;</p>

  <p align="center">TRANSFORMATION OF THE RUF/SL INTO A POLITICAL PARTY</p>
  <p>1. The Government of Sierra Leone shall accord every facility to the          RUF/SL to transform itself into a political party and enter the          mainstream of the democratic process. To that end:</p>
  <p>2. Immediately upon the signing of the present Agreement, the RUF/SL          shall commence to organize itself to function as a political movement,          with the rights, privileges and duties accorded to all political parties          in Sierra Leone. These include the freedom to publish, unhindered access          to the media, freedom of association, freedom of expression, freedom of          assembly, and the right to mobilize and associate freely.</p>
  <p>3. Within a period of thirty days, following the signing of the          present Agreement, the necessary legal steps shall be taken by the          Government of Sierra Leone to enable the RUF/SL to register as a          political party.</p>
  <p>4. The Parties shall approach the International Community with a view          to mobilizing resources for the purposes of enabling the RUF/SL to          function as a political party. These resources may include but shall not          be limited to:</p>
  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="center">ARTICLE IV</p>
  <p align="center">ENABLING MEMBERS OF THE RUF/SL TO HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE</p>
  <p>1. The Government of Sierra Leone shall take the necessary steps to          enable those RUF/SL members nominated by the RUF/SL to hold public          office, within the time-frames agreed and contained in the present          Agreement for the integration of the various bodies named herein.</p>
  <p>2. Accordingly, necessary legal steps shall be taken by the          Government of Sierra Leone, within a period of fourteen days following          the signing of the present Agreement, to amend relevant laws and          regulations that may constitute an impediment or bar to RUF/SL and AFRC          personnel holding public office.</p>
  <p>3. Within seven days of the removal of any such legal impediments,          both parties shall meet to discuss and agree on the appointment of          RUF/SL members to positions in parastatals, diplomacy and any other          public sector.</p>
  <p align="center">ARTICLE V</p>

  <p>1. The Government of Sierra Leone shall accord every opportunity to          the RUF/SL to join a broad-based government of national unity through          cabinet appointments. To that end:</p>

For this purpose he          shall enjoy the status of Vice President and shall therefore be          answerable only to the President of Sierra Leone.</p>
  <p>3. The Government of Sierra Leone shall give ministerial positions to          the RUF/SL in a moderately expanded cabinet of 18, bearing in mind that          the interests of other political parties and civil society organizations          should also be taken into account, as follows:</p>

  <p>5. Within a period of fourteen days following the signing of the          present Agreement, the necessary steps shall be taken by the Government          of Sierra Leone to remove any legal impediments that may prevent RUF/SL          members from holding cabinet and other positions.</p>
  <p align="center">ARTICLE VI</p>

  <p>Reiterate their commitment to the implementation of the Cease-fire          Agreement signed by the two parties on 18th May 1999 in Lome.</p>
  <p>Aware of the fact that the protracted civil strife in Sierra Leone          has created a situation whereby the vast majority of Sierra Leoneans in          need of humanitarian assistance cannot be reached.</p>
  <p>Hereby agree as follows:</p>
  <p>1. That all duly registered humanitarian agencies shall be guaranteed          safe and unhindered access to all areas under the control of the          respective parties in order that humanitarian assistance can be          delivered safely and effectively, in accordance with international          conventions, principles and norms govern humanitarian operations.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>3. The two parties undertake to establish with immediate effect, and          not later than seven days, an Implementation Committee formed by          appropriately designated and mandated representatives from the          Government of Sierra Leone, the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra          Leone, the Civil Society, the NGO community, and the UNOMSIL; and          chaired by the United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator, in          co-ordination with the Special Representative of the Secretary General          in Sierra Leone.</p>
  <p>The Implementation Committee will be mandated to:</p>
  <p>a. Ascertain and assess the security of proposed routes to be used by          the humanitarian agencies, and disseminate information on routes to          interested humanitarian agencies.</p>
  <p>b. Receive and review complaints which may arise in the          implementation of this arrangement, in order to re-establish full          compliance.</p>

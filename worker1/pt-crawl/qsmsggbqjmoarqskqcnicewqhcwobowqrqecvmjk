<p>
The coat of arms consists of an "iberian" shield (round
pointed with parallel sides and flat top), vert, a deer or
leaping from the sinister over an unidentified charge on a mound, all under
a sun placed in the sinister canton, all of the same; bordure or charged
with two churches, sinister and dexter, and two castle towers, top and bottom,
all or lined vert. Bellow the shield, a scroll with the isncription
"YUCAT&Aacute;N" in black capitals.<br>

<p>
Though the adoption of the new arms; at "Los Pinos", e.g. the President's residence, is still hoisted a white flag
charged with the former arms.<br>

"The most accurate version about the meaning of the five-star flag is that given 
by Historian
Rodolfo Men&eacute;ndez de la Pe&ntilde;a, who wrote a brief introduction on the cover of the
Serapio Baqueiro's book entitled <i>'Ensayo Hist&oacute;rico sobre las Revoluciones de 
Yucat&aacute;n de 1840 a 1864'</i> (Historic esay on the Yucat&aacute;n revolutions from 
1840 to 1864); the texts says: <b>'...the Yucat&aacute;n flag is divided into two fields: to 
the left, one field in green, and to the right, another divided in turn into three, 
red (top and bottom) and white (middle). The green area is featured by five beautiful
stars standing for the five departments into wich Yucat&aacute;n was administrativelly divided
by Decree of November 30, 1840: M&eacute;rida, Izamal, Valladolid, Tekax and 
Campeche...'</b> According the year on which the Peninsula was divided into five 
departments or districts, Writer Jos&eacute; Antonio Adonay Cetina Sierra poits out another date 
in his work 'Apuntaciones para la Historia Legislativa del Municipio de M&eacute;rida</i>'
(Notes for the Legislative History of the Municipality of M&eacute;rida):
<b>'It was then when Yucat&aacute;n decreed on May 24, 1837 a new territorial division
that reduced to five districts the then in effect colonial system; the town were
distributed and in some cases the politic and administrative jurisdiction were
enlarged: first district of M&eacute;rida, Department's capital; 
second district of 
<a href="mx-cam.html">Campeche</a>;
third district of Valladolid; fourth district of Izamal; and fifth district of 
Tekax'</b>"
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Respecting the <i>Yucatanense</i> flag it was displayed by a short time at the Palace
of the Government, according to Mr. Espejo, we count with the following information
supplied by Writer Juan Francisco Molina Sol&iacute;s in his work <i>"History of 
Yucat&aacute;n" vol. 1; page 177</i>: <b>'On night of March 16, 1841, during a meeting for the
installation fo the M&eacute;rida Constitutional Council, the main room was invaded by an
unarmed crowd, led by Barbachano, Francisco Mart&iacute;n Peraza and some others, asking for
the full independence of Yucat&aacute;n; then the Council under the crowd's presure agreed to 
review the proposal, (...) some of the most exitated people clang to the Palace's roof
and after downining the Mexican flag hoisted that of Yucatan.'</b> (...)"
</p>

<p align="justify">
&quot;After six months (?) (it should be say -seven months-) and four days when 
the flag of Yucat&aacute;n appeared, then October
20, 1841, the Congress of Yucat&aacute;n proclaimed the Independence of the Peninusula from
the Centralist Mexican Government, and starts to use the Peninsula flag as its symbol
before the world nations, flying it at the merchant and military ships, as soon as the
public buildings until December 15, 1843, when the <i>Yucatanense</i> government signs
a Peace and Friendship Agreement with the Mexican counterpart, stating in the article 
15 the following:
</p> 

<p>
<b>'Article 15: Yucat&aacute;n shall not use any flag but that of the nation (...)'</b>...&quot;.
</p>

The flag is divided in two fields. The hoist side bears, to my
rough calculations (could only get an artistic rendition and photos
with no regular sizes) a bit more than a third of the flag; this is a
green field, with five white five-pointed stars, arranged 2-1-2 (from top to bottom).
The fly is divided in three stripes: upper and lower in dark red, 
and a central and wider one in white. Again, the proportions
might be worng, but that's more or less what the flag looks like.
Today, it is extensively used by the Yucatan public, seen on t-shirts,
stickers and bumperstickers, sport jackets and so on.<br>

I have had exactly the same problems. It appears that, 
the flag of Yucatan is one of the most
popular unofficial flags of Mexican states. I have visited all web sites
refered here on this topic, and all show the same design with the wide
variation refered by Guillermo:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The overall ratio varies from ~2:3 to ~1:3 or longer; I'd settle for 1:2.</li>
  <li>The shades are mostely bright, though one variation shows indeed the dark red shade used by Guillermo. I'd stick to medium red, though.</li>
  <li>The stars are mostely five-pointed, though at least one flag variation shows six-pointed stars. Five pointed would be the adequate choice for a "typical" Yucatan flag.</li>
  <li>The fly side stripes are almost always equal sized, but at least one flag variation shows 1+2+1 (spanish style). Again, equal sized stripes
    would be the adequate choice.</li>
  <li>The green area varies also a lot: I've seen it from smaller than 1/3rd to almost one half. What would be the average? 2/5ths, perhaps?</li> 
</ul>

Flags like this were used by the PRI candite and his partisans for the government of 
Yucat&aacute;n early this year. A variant is featured for bearing bigger up-ward stars on the green field, and equal-wide
horizontal stripes.<br>

At present it is seen everywhere as part of a tourist

Like most of the Mexican states, Yucat&aacute;n first used as arms those granted to its
capital city, e.g. M&eacute;rida: &quot;A Spanish shield parted, the firts pale (left) azur charged by a castle in gold, and the
second pale (right) a rampant lion in gold on sinople (green). The top is a royal
crown. The ribbon bellow the shield bear the motto: &quot;Muy noble y muy leal ciudad de 
M&eacute;rida&quot;.<br>

																																																																																																																																																																								<p>Respondents, who operated a bar on non-Indian land on the
outskirts of an unincorporated village within the Wind River
Reservation and who had been denied a tribal liquor license by the
Wind River Tribes pursuant to their option under 18 U.S.C. § 1161
to regulate the introduction of liquor into Indian country, were
convicted at a nonjury trial of introducing spirituous beverages
into Indian country in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1154. Section
1154(c) defines the term "Indian country" as not including
fee-patented lands in non-Indian communities, but does not define
the term "non-Indian communities." In entering the judgment of
conviction, the District Court, on the basis of testimony about the
bar's location and the racial composition of residents of the
surrounding area as being largely Indian families, concluded that
the bar was located within "Indian country" and held that federal
authority could reach non-Indians located on privately held land
within a reservation's boundaries. The Court of Appeals reversed,
holding that the prosecution had not met its burden of proving
beyond a reasonable doubt that the bar was not excluded from Indian
country by the § 1154(c) exception for "fee-patented lands in
non-Indian communities"; that § 1154 was fatally defective because
of the indefiniteness and vagueness of the term "non-Indian
community"; and that, insofar as § 1161 authorized Indian tribes to
control the introduction of alcoholic beverages onto non-Indian
land, it was an invalid congressional attempt to delegate
authority.</p>
</p>
																																			<p><em>Held:</em></p>
</p>
																																			<p>1. Section 1154 is not unconstitutionally vague. Given the
nature of the bar's location and the surrounding population, the
statute was sufficient to advise respondents that their bar was not
excepted from tribal regulation by virtue of being located in a
non-Indian community. Pp. <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=

</p>
																																			<p>2. Congress has the authority under Art. I, § 8, of the
Constitution to regulate the distribution of alcoholic beverages by
establishments such as respondents' bar. Such authority is
adequate,</p>
</p>
																																			<p><a class="page-number" name="545">Page 419 U. S. 545</a></p>

</p>
																																			<p>3. Congress could validly delegate such authority to a
reservation's tribal council. The independent authority of Indian
tribes over matters that affect the internal and .social relations
of tribal life is sufficient to protect Congress' decision to vest
in tribal councils this portion of its own authority "to regulate
Commerce . . . with the Indian tribes" under Art. I, § 8. Pp.

U.S. 947 (1974), in order to consider the Solicitor General's
contentions that 18 U.S.C. § 1154 is not unconstitutionally vague,
that Congress has the constitutional authority to control the sale
of alcoholic beverages by non-Indians on fee-patented land within
the boundaries of an Indian reservation, and that Congress could
validly make a delegation of this authority to a reservation's
tribal council. We reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>
<strong class="heading-5 font-w-bold">I</strong>

															The Wind River Reservation was established by treaty in 1868.
Located in a rather arid portion of central Wyoming, at least some
of its 2,300,000 acres have been described by Mr. Justice Cardozo
as "fair and fertile," <em>Shoshone Tribe v. United States,</em>
<span class='l-leftover'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/299/476/">299 U. S. 476</a></span>,
<span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/299/476/#486">299 U. S. 486</a></span>
(1937). It straddles the Wind River, with its remarkable canyon,
and lies in a mile-high basin at the foot of the Wind River
Mountains, whose rugged, glaciated peaks and ridges form a portion
of the Continental Divide. [<a href="#F2" name="T2" id=
"T2">Footnote 2</a>] The reservation is occupied by the Shoshone
and Arapahoe Tribes. Although these tribes were once "ancestral
foes," <em>ibid.,</em> they are today jointly known as the Wind
River Tribes. As a result of various patents, substantial tracts of
non-Indian-held land are scattered within the reservation's
boundaries.</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="547">Page 419 U. S. 547</a></p>

															It was on such non-Indian land that respondents Martin and
Margaret Mazurie operated their bar, which did business under the
corporate name of the Blue Bull, Inc.</p>

															Before 1953, federal law generally prohibited the introduction
of alcoholic beverages into "Indian country." 18 U.S.C. § 1154(a).
"Indian country" was defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1151 to include
non-Indian-held lands "within the limits of any Indian
reservation." [<a href="#F3" name="T3" id="T3">Footnote 3</a>] In
1949, the term was given a narrower meaning, insofar as relevant to
the liquor prohibition, so as to exclude both fee-patented lands
within "non-Indian communities".and rights-of-way through
reservations.Act of May 24, 1949, 63 Stat. 94, 18 U.S.C. § 1154(c),
<em>supra,</em> <a href='#F1' name='T1' id="T1">n</a> 1. The quoted
term is not defined, a fact which creates problems with which we
shall shortly deal. In 1953, Congress passed local option
legislation allowing Indian tribes, with the approval of the
Secretary of the Interior, to regulate the introduction of liquor
into Indian country, so long as state law was not violated.Act of
Aug. 15, 1953, 67 Stat. 586, 18 U.S.C. § 1161. [<a href="#F4" name=
"T4" id="T4">Footnote 4</a>] The Wind River Tribes responded to
this option by adopting an ordinance which permitted</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="548">Page 419 U. S. 548</a></p>

															liquor sales on the reservation if made in accordance with
Wyoming law. When the Blue Bull originally opened, a liquor license
had been issued to it by Fremont County, Wyo., and its operation
was therefore consistent with that tribal ordinance. But in 1971,
the Wind River Tribes adopted a new liquor ordinance, Ordinance No.
26. [<a href="#F5" name="T5" id="T5">Footnote 5</a>] That ordinance
required that retail liquor outlets within Indian country obtain
both tribal and state licenses.</p>

															In 1972, the Mazuries applied for a tribal license, after
warnings that they would be subject to criminal charges if they
continued to operate without one. The tribes held a public hearing
which Martin Mazurie and the Mazuries' lawyer attended. Witnesses
protested grant of the license, complaining of singing and shooting
at late hours, disturbances of elderly residents of a nearby
housing development, and the permitting of Indian minors in the
bar. The application was denied.</p>

															Thereafter, the Mazuries closed the Blue Bull. Three weeks
later, they reopened it. It remained in operation for approximately
a year, until federal officers seized its alcoholic beverages, and
this criminal prosecution was initiated. [<a href="#F6" name="T6"
id="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>

															The case was tried to the District Court without a jury. Since
most of the factual issues were disposed of by stipulations,
[<a href="#F7" name="T7" id="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the testimony at
trial primarily dealt with</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="549">Page 419 U. S. 549</a></p>

															whether the bar was within "Indian country." On the basis of
testimony about the Blue Bull's location, and about the racial
composition of residents of the surrounding area, the court
concluded that the bar was so located. Holding that federal
authority could reach non-Indians located on privately held land
within a reservation's boundaries, the court entered judgments of
conviction. Each respondent was fined $100.</p>

															The Court of Appeals reversed the convictions. It concluded that
the prosecution had not carried its burden of proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that the bar was not excluded from Indian country
by the § 1154(c) exception for "fee-patented lands in non-Indian
communities." [<a href="#F8" name="T8" id="T8">Footnote 8</a>] This
conclusion was tied directly to the more basic holding:</p>

															"[T]he terminology of 'non-Indian community' is not capable of
sufficiently precise definition to serve as</p>

															<a class='page-number' name='550'>Page 419 U. S. 550</a></p>

															an element of the crime herein considered. . . . The statute is
thus fatally defective by reason of this indefinite and vague
terminology."</p>

															487 F.2d at 18.</p>

															As a second basis for reversal, the court held that, insofar as
18 U.S.C. § 1161 authorized Indian tribes to adopt ordinances
controlling the introduction by non-Indians of alcoholic beverages
onto non-Indian land, it was an invalid congressional attempt to
delegate authority. The Court of Appeals also suggested that
Congress itself could not regulate the sale of alcohol by
non-Indians on fee-patented non-Indian lands within Indian
reservations.</p>
<strong class="heading-5 font-w-bold">II</strong>

															It is well established that vagueness challenges to statutes
which do not involve First Amendment freedoms must be examined in
the light of the facts of the case at hand. <em>United States v.
National Dairy Products Corp.,</em> <span class=
'l-leftover'><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/29/">372 U. S.
29</a></span> (1963). In determining whether § 1154(c) is
unconstitutionally vague as to respondents, we must therefore first
consider the evidence as to the location of the Blue Bull.
[<a href="#F9" name="T9" id="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="551">Page 419 U. S. 551</a></p>

															The evidence showed that the bar was located on the outskirts of
Fort Washakie, Wyo., an unincorporated village bearing the name of
the man who was chief of the Shoshones during their early years on
the Wind River Reservation. <em>Shoshone Tribe v. United
States,</em> 299 U.S. at <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/299/476/#486">299 U. S. 486</a></span>;
Harmston, <em>supra,</em> <a href='#F2' name='T2' id="T2">n</a> 2,
at 3-4. Fort Washakie is the location of the Wind River Agency of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and of the Tribal Headquarters of the
Wind River Tribes. One witness testified that the village was an
"Indian community." App 49. The evidence also showed that, of the
212 families living within a 20-square-mile area roughly centered
on the Blue Bull, 170 were Indian families, 41 were non-Indians,
and one was mixed. A large-scale United States Geological Survey
map was introduced to show the limits of this housing survey. It
indicates that the survey included all settlements within the Fort
Washakie area, and that the nearest not-included concentrations of
housing were at Saint James Church and Ethete, some four miles
beyond the boundaries of the survey and some six miles from Fort
Washakie. The evidence also established that the state school
serving Fort Washakie, and located about two and one-half miles
from the Blue Bull, had a total enrollment of 243 students, 223 of
whom were Indian.</p>

															Other evidence bearing on whether the Blue Bull was located in a
non-Indian community was Martin Mazurie's testimony that the bar
served both Indians and non-Indians, and that: "We are kind of out
there by ourselves, you know." App. 70. A transcript of the hearing
on</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="552">Page 419 U. S. 552</a></p>

															the Mazuries' application to the tribes for a retail liquor
license was also admitted at the trial. That transcript indicates
that the Blue Bull was located near a public housing development
populated largely if not entirely by Indians. Residents of this
development complained that persons leaving the bar late at night,
and for one reason or another having either no transportation or no
destination, would wander into the development.</p>

															There was no testimony that the Blue Bull was in a non-Indian
community. The defense did obtain acknowledgments by prosecution
witnesses that they could not precisely state the boundaries of the
Fort Washakie Indian community. Otherwise, examination by the
defense was directed at establishing that the term "Indian" was
without precise meaning, and that the State of Wyoming generally
had jurisdiction over non-Indians and their lands within the
reservation.</p>

															We think that the foregoing evidence was sufficient to justify
the District Court's implied conclusion that Fort Washakie and its
surrounding settlements did not compose a non-Indian community. We
do not read the opinion of the Court of Appeals as reaching a
conclusion contrary to that which we have just stated. That court
instead based its decision on the proposition that such proof did
not go far enough, a view generated by its opinion of the
requirements this statute must meet in order to avoid the vice of
vagueness. The Court of Appeals was looking for proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of precisely defined concepts of "Indian" and
"community." We gather that it expected persons treated as
"Indians" in the housing and school surveys to be proved to satisfy
a specific statutory definition. Similarly, it apparently expected
that proof concerning the "community" should have conformed to some
specific statutory definition, presumably one keyed to a
geographical area with precise boundaries.</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="553">Page 419 U. S. 553</a></p>

															We believe that the Court of Appeals erred by holding that the
Constitution requires proof of such precisely defined concepts. The
prosecution was required to do no more than prove that the Blue
Bull was not located in a non-Indian community, where that term has
a meaning sufficiently precise for a man of average intelligence to
"reasonably understand that his contemplated conduct is
proscribed." <em>United States v. National Dairy Products
Corp.,</em> 372 U.S. at <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/372/29/#32">372 U. S. 32</a></span>-33.
Given the nature of the Blue Bull's location and surrounding
population, the statute was sufficient to advise the Mazuries that
their bar was not excepted from tribal regulation by virtue of
being located in a non-Indian community. [<a href="#F10" name="T10"
id="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>
<strong class="heading-5 font-w-bold">III</strong>

															The Court of Appeals expressed doubt that "the Government has
the power to regulate a business on the land it granted in fee
without restrictions." 487 F.2d at 18. Because that court went on
to hold that, even if Congress did possess such power, it could not
be delegated to an Indian tribe, that court did not find it
necessary to</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="554">Page 419 U. S. 554</a></p>

															resolve the issue of congressional power. We do, however, reach
the issue, because we hereinafter conclude that federal authority
was properly delegated to the Indian tribes. We conclude that
federal authority is adequate, even though the lands were held in
fee by non-Indians, and even though the persons regulated were
non-Indians.</p>

															Article I, § 8, of the Constitution gives Congress power "[t]o
regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several
States, and with the Indian Tribes." This Court has repeatedly held
that this clause affords Congress the power to prohibit or regulate
the sale of alcoholic beverages to tribal Indians, wherever
situated, and to prohibit or regulate the introduction of alcoholic
beverages into Indian country. [<a href="#F11" name="T11" id=

															<em>Perrin v. United States, supra,</em> demonstrates the
controlling principle. It dealt with the sale of intoxicating
beverages within premises owned by non-Indians, on privately held
land in an organized non-Indian municipality. The land originally
had been included in the Yankton Sioux Indian Reservation, but had
been ceded to the United States. The cession agreement, as ratified
and confirmed by Congress, specified that alcoholic beverages would
never be sold on the ceded land. The land</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="555">Page 419 U. S. 555</a></p>

															was subsequently opened to private non-Indian settlers. In
upholding Perrin's conviction, this Court stated:</p>

															"The power of Congress to prohibit the introduction of
intoxicating liquors into an Indian reservation, wheresoever
situate, and to prohibit traffic in such liquors with tribal
Indians, whether upon or off a reservation and whether within or
without the limits of a State, does not admit of any doubt. It
arises in part from the clause in the Constitution investing
Congress with authority 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations,
and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes,' and in
part from the recognized relation of tribal Indians to the federal
Government."</p>

															232 U.S. at <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=

															<em>Seymour v. Superintendent,</em> <span class=
'l-leftover'><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/351/">368 U.
S. 351</a></span> (1962), is a more recent indication of
congressional authority over events occurring on non-Indian land
within a reservation. The case concerned an Indian's challenge to a
state burglary conviction. The Indian contended that, because the
offense took place within "Indian country," it was within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States by virtue of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1153. This Court agreed, despite the fact that the crime occurred
on land patented in fee to non-Indians. While the opinion did not
address the constitutional issue, it did reject a variety of
statutory arguments for excluding the crime's situs from 18 U.S.C.
§ 1151's definition of "Indian country." Of significance for our
purposes is the fact that Congress' authority to define "Indian
country" so broadly, and to supersede state jurisdiction within the
defined area, went both unchallenged by the parties and
unquestioned by this Court.</p>

															We hold that neither the Constitution nor our previous cases
leave any room for doubt that Congress possesses</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="556">Page 419 U. S. 556</a></p>

															the authority to regulate the distribution of alcoholic
beverages by establishments such as the Blue Bull.</p>
<strong class="heading-5 font-w-bold">IV</strong>

															The Court of Appeals said, however, that, even if Congress
possessed authority to regulate the Blue Bull, it could not
delegate such authority to the Indian tribes. The court reasoned as
follows:</p>

															"The tribal members are citizens of the United States. It is
difficult to see how such an association of citizens could exercise
any degree of governmental authority or sovereignty over other
citizens who do not belong, and who cannot participate in any way
in the tribal organization. The situation is in no way comparable
to a city, county, or special district under state laws. There
cannot be such a separate 'nation' of United States citizens within
the boundaries of the United States which has any authority, other
than as landowners, over individuals who are excluded as
members."</p>

															"<em>* * * *"</em></p>

															"The purported delegation of authority to the tribal officials
contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1161 is therefore invalid. Congress cannot
delegate its authority to a private, voluntary organization, which
is obviously not a governmental agency, to regulate a business on
privately owned lands, no matter where located. It is obvious that
the authority of Congress under the Constitution to regulate
commerce with Indian Tribes is broad, but it cannot encompass the
relationships here concerned."</p>

															487 F.2d at 19.</p>

															This Court has recognized limits on the authority of Congress to
delegate its legislative power. <em>Panama Refining Co. v.
Ryan,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/293/388/">293 U. S. 388</a></span>
(1935). Those limitations are, however, less stringent in cases
where the entity</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="557">Page 419 U. S. 557</a></p>

															exercising the delegated authority itself possesses independent
authority over the subject matter. <em>United States v.
Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/299/304/">299 U. S. 304</a></span>,
<span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/299/304/#319">299 U. S.
319</a></span>-322 (1936). Thus, it is an important aspect of this
case that Indian tribes are unique aggregations possessing
attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their
territory, <em><span class='l-italics'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/31/515/">Worcester v.
Georgia</a>,</span></em> 6 Pet. 515, <span class=
'l-normaldigitafter'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/31/515/#557">31 U. S. 557</a></span>
(1832); they are "a separate people" possessing "the power of
regulating their internal and social relations . . . ," <em>United
States v. Kagama,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/118/375/">118 U. S. 375</a></span>,
<span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=

<span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/411/164/#173">411 U. S. 173</a></span>
(1973).</p>

															Cases such as <em>Worcester, supra,</em> and <em>Kagama,
supra,</em> surely establish the proposition that Indian tribes
within "Indian country" are a good deal more than "private,
voluntary organizations," and they thus undermine the rationale of
the Court of Appeals' decision. These same cases, in addition, make
clear that, when Congress delegated its authority to control the
introduction of alcoholic beverages into Indian country, it did so
to entities which possess a certain degree of independent authority
over matters that affect the internal and social relations of
tribal life. Clearly the distribution and use of intoxicants is
just such a matter. We need not decide whether this independent
authority is itself sufficient for the tribes to impose Ordinance
No. 26. It is necessary only to state that the independent tribal
authority is quite sufficient to protect Congress' decision to vest
in tribal councils this portion of its own authority "to regulate
Commerce . . . with the Indian tribes." <em>Cf. United States v.
Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., supra.</em></p>

															The fact that the Mazuries could not become members of the
tribe, and therefore could not participate in the tribal
government, does not alter our conclusion. This claim, that,
because respondents are non-Indians Congress</p>

															<a class="page-number" name="558">Page 419 U. S. 558</a></p>

															could not subject them to the authority of the Tribal Council
with respect to the sale of liquor, [<a href="#F12" name="T12" id=
"T12">Footnote 12</a>] is answered by this Court's opinion in
<em>Williams v Lee,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/358/217/">358 U. S. 217</a></span>
(1959). In holding that the authority of tribal courts could extend
over non-Indians, insofar as concerned their transactions on a
reservation with Indians, we stated:</p>

															"It is immaterial that respondent is not an Indian. He was on
the Reservation and the transaction with an Indian took place
there. The cases in this Court have consistently guarded the
authority of Indian governments over their reservations. Congress
recognized this authority in the Navajos in the Treaty of 1868, and
has done so ever since. If this power is to be taken away from
them, it is for Congress to do it. <em>Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock,</em>

															The Blue Bull was reopened after the decision of the Court of
Appeals. In April, 1974, however, Fremont County refused to renew
its license and it was again closed. Brief for United States 5 n.
4; Brief for Respondents 20 n. 8.</p>

															[<a href="#T7" name="F7" id="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>

															It was stipulated that the Blue Bull was being operated without
the license required by Ordinance No. 26, that alcoholic beverages
had been sold at the Blue Bull, that the Blue Bull was located
within the Wind River Reservation, but on land which it owned in
fee, and that the Blue Bull had been properly licensed by state
authorities.</p>

															[<a href="#T8" name="F8" id="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>

															The District Court did not make a specific finding of fact that
the Blue Bull was not located in a non-Indian community. The court
did find that it was in "Indian Country," that it was situated "at
a site known as Fort Washakie, Wyoming," that "Fort Washakie is not
an incorporated non-Indian community with recognized boundaries,"
and that the bar had been operated in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1154
(which contains the exclusion from "Indian country" of fee-patented
lands in non-Indian communities). The ambiguity in the trial
court's findings is readily explained by respondents' failure to
focus on the issue at trial. The nature of defense testimony and
cross-examination is discussed <em>infra</em> at <span class=
'l-normaldigitafter'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/419/544/#552">419 U. S. 552</a></span>.
That respondents failed to contest the issue is further established
by the motion to dismiss at the close of the Government's evidence.
The basis of the motion as failure "to prove beyond a doubt that
[respondents] <em>are</em> operating in an <em>Indian</em>
community," App. 64 (emphasis added), which even if true is plainly
irrelevant under the wording of § 1154(c). Respondents' counsel
then proceeded with an argument based on respondents' unrestricted
fee ownership of the property on which the bar was located. App.
64. In addition, respondents' counsel did not dispute the court's
statement at the close of the trial that the "sole issue" was
"whether or not the Tribal Council has jurisdiction over deeded
land held by these parties in fee. . . ." 2 Record on Appeal 140.
The court went on to state:</p>

															"[I]t is in Indian Country. There is not any question. You do
not need to cite a single case that this bar and this ten acres is
[<em>sic</em>] located in Indian Country. I am not saying it is
Indian land, but it is Indian Country."</p>

															<em>Ibid.</em> Again, respondents' counsel made no objection. He
also apparently did not seek to focus the court's attention on the
issue by filing either a post-trial brief or proposed findings of
fact and conclusions of law; while both parties had the opportunity
to make such submissions, only the prosecution's appears in the
record on appeal.</p>

															[<a href="#T9" name="F9" id="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>

															We assume, <em>arguendo,</em> as has the Government in its
arguments before this court, that the prosecution has the burden of
proving that the § 1154(c) statutory exceptions are not applicable.
Because of this assumption, and because we conclude that the
Government, in any event, did carry this burden, we need not
consider whether the exception must be pleaded and proved by
criminal defendants. <em>Cf. United States v. Vuitch,</em>
<span class='l-leftover'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/402/62/">402 U. S. 62</a></span>,
<span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=
"/cases/federal/us/402/62/#70">402 U. S. 70</a></span>
(1971) (dealing with a criminal statute in which "an exception is
incorporated in the <em>enacting clause</em> of a statute").
(Emphasis supplied.)</p>

															[<a href="#T10" name="F10" id="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>

															We note that the § 1154(c) exception is available for
fee-patented lands which <em>are</em> in <em>non-Indian</em>
communities, rather than for those which <em>are not</em> in
<em>Indian</em> communities. This fact renders irrelevant the
inability of prosecution witnesses to specify precise boundaries of
the Fort Washakie Indian community.</p>

															We need not detain ourselves with an issue which seemed to cause
the Court of Appeals some difficulties, that of what qualifies a
person as an "Indian." The record plainly establishes that, in the
circumstances of this case, the distinction between Indians and
non-Indians was generally understood. Those who testified about the
housing and school surveys displayed no difficulty in making such
classifications. Nor did Mr. Mazurie. He testified that, when there
was trouble at his bar, he would call the county sheriff to deal
with a non-Indian, but would call the tribal police to deal with an
Indian. When his counsel questioned him as to how he determined
which was which, he simply replied: "Because I knew them." App.
70.</p>

															[<a href="#T11" name="F11" id="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>

															It is undisputed that the Wind River Tribes have not been
emancipated from federal guardianship and control. There is thus no
doubt that this case is properly analyzed in terms of Congress
exclusive constitutional authority to deal with Indian tribes.</p>

															[<a href="#T12" name="F12" id="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>

															Respondents attempt to bolster this claim with the argument that
"the basic rights and principles of equal protection and due
process [are] currently not available to non-Indians within the
tribal councils." Brief for Respondents 24. However, respondents
make no claim that the tribal decision to deny them a license
constituted a denial of equal protection or that it resulted from a
hearing which lacked due process. Whether and to what extent the
Fifth Amendment would be available to correct arbitrary or
discriminatory tribal exercise of its delegated federal authority
must therefore await decision in a case in which the issue is
squarely presented and appropriately briefed. This observation is
also applicable with regard to § 202 of Pub.L. 9284, 82 Stat. 77,
25 U.S.C. § 1302, which provides.</p>

															"No Indian tribe in exercising powers of self-government shall .
. . (8) deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property
without due process of law."</p>

															Quite apart from these potential sources of protection against
arbitrary tribal action, such protection is to some extent assured
by § 1161's requirement that delegated authority be exercised
pursuant to a tribal ordinance which itself has been approved by
the Secretary of the Interior.</p>

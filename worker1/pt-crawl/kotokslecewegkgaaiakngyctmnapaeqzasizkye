The police described the victims as bystanders, and said that none of them suffered life-threatening injuries. Neither Ms. Lopez nor Mr. Combs was charged in connection with the shootings, and Ms. Lopez was later cleared of any involvement and released.</p><p>A rap performer who was in Mr. Combs's group, Jamal Barrows, 21, was charged with three counts of attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon, the police said.</p><p>Investigators later said they were looking into witness accounts that Mr. Barrows fired because he believed that someone had said something disrespectful to Mr. Combs. Prosecutors said a witness told the police that Mr. Combs and Mr. Barrows were arguing with several other people in the club and that after one of them threw a stack of money at Mr. Combs, both he and Mr. Barrows pulled semiautomatic pistols and Mr. Barrows fired. Prosecutors said at Mr. Combs's arraignment last night that he did not fire the weapon.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322031001im_/http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt=""/></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322031001im_/http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt=""/></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

''I do not own a gun, I do not carry a gun,'' he said. ''The charges against me are 100 percent false and I feel confident that in the next couple of days I'll be vindicated.''</p><p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir said yesterday that Mr. Combs and Ms. Lopez, who both fled after the shooting in a 1999 Lincoln Navigator, had been arrested along with Mr. Combs's bodyguard and his driver on gun possession charges, because a stolen pistol was found in the vehicle. The gun found in the vehicle was not the one used in the shootings in the club, the police said.</p><p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office decided to release Ms. Lopez. Officials said Ms. Lopez, who has appeared in nearly a dozen films and has been romantically linked to Mr. Combs, was released because she was unaware that the gun was in the car and because she cooperated with the police.</p><p>Mr. Combs, 30, who grew up in Harlem, rose from an intern at a small rap record label to become one of the hip-hop world's leading impresarios. His successful recording career led to his greater success as a producer and promoter; he founded his own label, Bad Boy Records, which he later sold to Arista Records for $15 million.</p><p>But even as he became renowned as a rap mogul, Mr. Combs has also had brushes with the law, most notably an incident earlier this year in which he was accused of severely beating a record executive.</p><p>Ms. Lopez, 29, was released about 4 p.m. from the Midtown South Precinct station house. She did not speak with reporters, but her lawyer, Larry Ruggiero, said: ''They established she did nothing wrong. Jennifer had nothing to do with the gun or the shooting.''</p><p>Also arrested yesterday were Mr. Combs's bodyguard, Anthony Jones, 34, and Mr. Combs's driver, Wardel Fenderson, 41. The police charged Mr. Combs, Mr. Jones and Mr. Fenderson with criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of stolen property, because the 9-millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson Model 915 pistol found in the Navigator was reported stolen in August in Georgia, the authorities said. Mr. Jones was also charged with marijuana possession, the police said.</p><p>Inside the club investigators recovered four shell casings, two from a 9-millimeter pistol and two from a .40-caliber gun, the police said. The 9-millimeter casings were believed to have come from the weapon that the police said Mr. Barrows was carrying when he was arrested. It was not clear who fired the .40-caliber bullets, and no .40-caliber pistol had been recovered.</p><p>Eric S. Funk, the club's general manager, said Mr. Combs and Ms. Lopez arrived with about 30 people sometime after midnight and spent most of the evening in a V.I.P. section set off from the rest of the club by velvet ropes. He said patrons were searched and screened with a metal detector, but neither he nor the club's owner, Michael Bergos, could say how the guns got inside the nightspot. Neither man would discuss the details of the shootings, citing the police investigation.</p><p>Mr. Combs and the three other suspects were arraigned last night and early this morning in Manhattan Criminal Court before Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein, who released Mr. Jones on $20,000 bail and Mr. Fenderson on $2,000 bail.</p><p>Mr. Barrows, 21, was was held without bail after his arraignment early this morning on three counts of attempted murder. His lawyer, Ian Niles, denied his client had shot anyone and said Mr. Barrows intended to testify before a grand jury to explain his innocence.</p><p>Prosecutors said that a ballistics test on the gun Mr. Barrows was carrying when he was arrested matched some of the spent shell casings found in the club.</p><p>Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos asked for $100,000 bail for Mr. Combs, saying that the performer ''has a history of violence.'' He sought bail of $50,000 for Mr. Jones and $25,000 for Mr. Fenderson. Mr. Combs's lawyer, Harvey Slovis, said the witnesses who told authorities that Mr. Combs had drawn a gun were lying.</p><p>''I don't know if you know this, judge, but this person Jennifer Lopez is a very famous actress,'' Mr. Slovis said. ''To think that Mr. Combs is walking around with her with a loaded gun and then going to pull it out, it's so ridiculous that it stretches the imagination.''</p><p>The police identified the victims of the shooting as Natanya Ruben, 29, and Julius Jones, 27, both of Brooklyn, and Robert Thompson, of Danbury, Conn. Ms. Ruben, who was shot in the face, and Mr. Jones, who was shot in the shoulder, were both in stable condition last night at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, said Mark G. Ackermann, a hospital spokesman. Mr. Thompson refused medical attention, the police said.</p><p>The police said that after the shooting inside the club, Mr. Combs and Ms. Lopez ran out and jumped into the car driven by Mr. Fenderson. The Navigator sped down West 43rd Street toward Eighth Avenue and swerved around a marked police car, its dome lights flashing, that officers had parked in the middle of the street to close off the block.</p><p>The Navigator sped north on Eighth Avenue, the authorities said, running 11 red lights before it was pulled over on the northeast corner of West 54th Street and Eighth Avenue. Mr. Combs, Mr. Jones, Mr. Fenderson and Ms. Lopez all climbed out of the car and the police found the gun under the front passenger seat, where Mr. Jones had been riding, the authorities said.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->

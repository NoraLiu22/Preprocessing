        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="207">BY THE time Tab Ramos was in high school, at St. Benedict's Prep in Newark, he was a popular, friendly student. Yet he rarely went out partying, never had to be given a curfew, and always did his schoolwork.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="139" data-total-count="346">It's not that he was a nerd. It's just that he was resolute about not risking anything that could thwart his greatest love: playing soccer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="213" data-total-count="559">''I was a kid who, if I had a game the next day, I'd be home with my feet up the night before,'' Mr. Ramos said. ''I'd ask my mom to make pasta for a pre-game meal. I mean, this is when I was 12 or 13 years old.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="265" data-total-count="824">Once, after he got a midterm grade of D, his father forbade soccer until he got at least a C in that class. He can't remember what the class was, but he remembers the pain of missing three straight weekends of play in one of the important winter indoor tournaments.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="142" data-total-count="1203" id="story-continues-3">Now 29, Mr. Ramos has more than amply fulfilled that childhood dream. He is the best American player ever, in the eyes of most soccer experts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="457" data-total-count="1660">And after six nomadic years playing professionally in Spain and Mexico as well as on United States national teams, Mr. Ramos is finally able to live out his dream at home. Home, as in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, where he plays for the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in Major League Soccer, the new pro league that has had surprising success at the turnstiles and on the field this summer. The MetroStars are drawing crowds of more than 26,000 a game.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="216" data-total-count="1876">Giants Stadium is a short trip up the turnpike from Old Bridge, where Mr. Ramos lives with his wife, Amy -- a former North Carolina State University soccer player like her husband -- and their 16-month-old son, Alex.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="2001">And it's just a few miles from where he grew up, in Harrison and Kearny, towns that have been soccer hotbeds for generations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="514" data-total-count="2515">Julian Ramos, a tool-and-die maker, moved his family to Harrison from Montevideo, Uruguay, when Tabare (pronounced tah-bah-RAY, it is a name from a tribe of ancient Uruguayan Indians, the Charruas) was 10. Unable to speak much English, Tab found friends quickly on the playgrounds, where his almost magical ability to control a soccer ball put the others in awe. Friends guided him into the extended soccer family of the Kearny-area leagues, and eventually a coach, Phil Santamessina, guided him to St. Benedict's.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="2853">''I owe just about everything to St. Benedict's,'' Mr. Ramos said in a recent interview. ''Not only the school, and the education I got there, but Father Edwin, the headmaster. He's like family to me. To this day, I talk to him all the time. Any major decision I've had to make, in my career or in my life, I've talked through with him.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="331" data-total-count="3184">THE REV. EDWIN LEAHY, whose 130-year-old school has about 530 boys in grades 7 to 12, laughs when he hears that Mr. Ramos said he owes everything to St. Benedict's. The school now has one of the best-known soccer programs in the nation, but, the headmaster said, ''St. Benedict's soccer wasn't anything until Tab Ramos came here.''</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="3497" id="story-continues-4">''It was clear from the start he had an unbelievable talent,'' Father Edwin said. ''But on the team, there were very few other kids who really knew how to play. Our game plan was, 'Kick the ball as far as you can and let Tab find it and do the rest.' You know, he scored 161 goals in high school -- in 80 games.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="441" data-total-count="3938">School soccer of that caliber wasn't enough to nourish such a remarkable talent. He also played club soccer, for Thistle United in the formidable Kearny youth leagues, where his club included two future teammates on the United States national team, the goalkeeper Tony Meola (now the MetroStars' starting goalie), and the midfielder John Harkes (who has played in the top English league and now plays for D.C. United in Major League Soccer).</p><div class="newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter variant-1-hidden " id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productcode="" data-newsletter-producttitle="" aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="287" data-total-count="4225">After playing for New Jersey state all-star teams, Mr. Ramos caught the eye of elite-level coaches and was invited to try out for the United States Under-20 national team -- when he was still only 16. He made it and was asked to play in the regional Under-20 championships, in Guatemala.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="84" data-total-count="4309">There was one problem, however. Father Edwin vividly remembers how he learned of it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="4557">Coming back from vacation on a Sunday that July, he got out of his car in the school parking lot and saw Tab Ramos running to meet him. The headmaster remembers the conversation like this: ''Father Ed, Father Ed, I can play for the national team!''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="28" data-total-count="4585">''That's great Tab, great.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="36" data-total-count="4621">''But I have to be a U.S. citizen.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="4707">''O.K., that's fine, we'll help you. When do you have to play for the national team?''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="13" data-total-count="4720">''Thursday.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="5031">Partly because of help from Representative Peter Rodino and other politicians, and partly because Julian Ramos, Tab's father, had already applied for citizenship and had met many of the requirements, the 16-year-old soccer star became an American in less than three weeks, in time to join the team in Guatemala.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="544" data-total-count="5575">He has been a mainstay of United States national teams ever since, except for 1984, when he was one of the last men cut from the Olympic team. But that said more about the Olympic coaches than about Tab, for, the very same year, the New York Cosmos -- star team of the last pro league to try to thrive in this country -- drafted him right out of high school. Friends who knew that the North American Soccer League's future was shaky urged him to go to North Carolina State instead of turning pro -- and indeed, that league folded the next year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="455" data-total-count="6030">Twelve years later, soccer fans here are finally able to enjoy what Mr. Ramos has to offer: mastery of the ball that is almost uncanny. It's on view in the deft, quick touches that take him and the ball around the legs of opponents; in passes to teammates that, whether short or long, arrive exactly where the teammate would like them; and in a cracking-hard shot so powerful that it seems impossible it could come from that 5-foot-6-inch, 140-pound body.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="500" data-total-count="6530">Darting among larger men, Mr. Ramos gives the impression of being one of the fastest players on the field. Sunil Gulati, deputy commissioner of Major League Soccer and the league's most knowledgeable soccer expert, says that on the national team, there are probably 10 men who could beat Mr. Ramos in a 50-yard dash. ''But over the first five yards, there would be very few who'd beat him,'' Mr. Gulati said. ''Over the first yard, even fewer. And over the first yard with the ball, there's nobody.''</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="315" data-total-count="6845" id="story-continues-5">Paradoxically, the ball-control talent that makes Mr. Ramos so delightful to watch leads to his greatest flaw. He has developed a hair-trigger temper on the field, which flares when he is fouled -- and he is one of the most frequently fouled players in the league -- or when he thinks the referee has missed a foul.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="170" data-total-count="7015">After receiving five yellow-card warnings from referees, a player must sit out a one-game suspension; that happened to Mr. Ramos, who missed the Aug. 11 game in Colorado.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="7318">His friend Father Edwin, who said he ''never saw Tab utter a cross word at a teammate or a referee'' in high school, thinks he knows why it happens. As a youngster, Mr. Ramos was so much better than the others, he said, that ''there were very few situations that could create huge frustration for him.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="7602">''He was so clever and elusive,'' Father Edwin added, ''that even if they wanted to whack him, they'd end up swinging at air. But in the pros, guys he's up against are big, strong and not terrible soccer players; they can whack him all over the place. And his frustration comes out.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="79" data-total-count="7681">Still, if he is ejected or has to sit out suspensions, he cannot help his team.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="307" data-total-count="7988">''I regret it; I regret it all the time,'' Mr. Ramos said. ''I'm like a different person out there than I am off the field -- as my wife can tell you. Look, I don't know if it could ever be justified, but if it can, the reason it happens is because I'm such a tough competitor and I'll do anything to win.''</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>

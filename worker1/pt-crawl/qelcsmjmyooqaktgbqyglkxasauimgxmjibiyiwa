		<td>Subsequent to the elections, the newly elected parliamentarians chose Mr. Bikenibeu Paeniu as Prime Minister. The five-member Cabinet formed on 16 October was reportedly composed mainly of opponents of the previous administration (headed by Prime Minister Tomasi Puapua). Mr. Paeniu announced that his Government would aim to reduce Tuvalu&rsquo;s dependence on foreign aid and to promote a greater sense of national identity in its citizenry.</td>

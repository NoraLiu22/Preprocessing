<h3>Our History</h3>

<a href="/web/20071009234858/http://www.landmarkcom.com/print/history.html" target="_blank"><img src="/web/20071009234858im_/http://www.landmarkcom.com/images/print.gif" width="140" height="40" vspace="4" alt="print" title="Click here to print this page" border="0"/></a>


<p><img src="/web/20071009234858im_/http://www.landmarkcom.com/images/modelt.gif" width="174" height="110" alt="Model T" border="1" align="right"><span class="first">F</span>or half a century, Samuel L. Slover was a dominant figure in Virginia newspaper publishing circles. During his 86 years he owned or controlled six of the state's largest newspapers, headed numerous other business and civic enterprises and exerted influence on Virginia politics. A zestful trader, Slover might have built a journalistic empire in the East. He preferred to nurture sick newspapers into healthy ones, rather than simply accumulate a chain of journals. Slover came to Virginia in 1900 bearing the sting of failure in his first venture, plus a heavy debt. At 20 he had become business manager of the failing Knoxville Journal in his native Tennessee. The newspaper rallied in his inexperienced hands but ultimately lapsed into bankruptcy. At 22, he insisted on assuming all of the Journal's financial obligations, amounting to $36,400, and eventually paid them off.</p>

<p><strong class="red2">Samuel Slover's early newspaper success swift</strong><br/>
<span class="first">S</span>lover traveled Virginia as an advertising salesman for a New York trade journal. He found the Commonwealth had few newspapers of consequence and that most of these were at each other's throats in a bumbling search for survival. Entrepreneurial instincts aroused, Slover called one day on Joseph Bryan, owner of the Richmond Times and a man of means, influence and manner. Slover asked for a loan to buy a newspaper in Norfolk. Astonished, Bryan declined. Slover asked next for a job selling advertising. No vacancy, said Bryan. Slover then proposed that he sell on a commission basis, calling on businesses that were not advertising in the Times, and Bryan agreed. Slover's success at generating new business was so swift that he was soon offered half interest in a Newport News newspaper conditioned on his pulling the paper out of the red within one year. He took the offer and did the job. Control and invigoration of newspapers in Richmond and Petersburg were to follow.</p>

<p><strong class="red2">Slover launches The Virginian-Pilot and Virginia's first radio station</strong><br/><img src="/web/20071009234858im_/http://www.landmarkcom.com/images/sm_slover.jpg" width="100" height="140" alt="Samuel Slover" border="1" hspace="4" align="left"><span class="first">B</span>ut at all times, Slover's goal was to own and organize soundly the newspapers on the south side of Hampton Roads, now the site of the world's largest naval base. Then dominated by Norfolk, the area now also embraces the contiguous cities of Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, Chesapeake and Suffolk, with a combined population exceeding 1 million. Slover reached his goal through a series of purchases and mergers resulting in what is now The Virginian-Pilot. Along the way, he acquired Virginian's first radio station and launched the second television station in Virginia. For Samuel L. Slover, this was sufficient success. He began sharing his success by offering stock on extremely generous terms to startled but appreciative employees who ran the supervisory gamut. Simultaneously, he moved toward retirement. He had never considered the newspapers he owned or controlled as his personal journals but as community institutions owing their success to associates who managed them. Calls followed him into retirement urging him to buy other papers - some ailing, others robust. Slover referred the calls to other owners he esteemed for journalistic standards.</p>

<p><strong class="red2">At 27, Frank Batten becomes Publisher of The Virginian-Pilot</strong><br/>

<span class="first">A</span> natural leader stamped with a confident manner and decisive mind, Slover had laid the foundation upon which his nephew, Frank Batten, would build Landmark Communications. Inseparable from Slover's repute as a Publisher was a personal reputation for unstinting loyalty, generosity, community service and an unyielding code of personal and business ethics. Slover bequeathed those values and control of the business to his nephew. For 30 years following the death of Batten's own father, the two shared a father-son relationship. "My uncle took a great chance putting me in as publisher at 27," Batten recalls. But Batten had soaked up a lot of newspaper lore from his uncle. He had been schooled at the University of Virginia and the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and had working introductions to news, advertising and circulation. And his gentle, easy manner belied a restless, inquisitive mind that was primed to engage and to commit.</p>

<p><strong class="red2">Pilot wins Pulitzer for championing desegregation efforts</strong><br/>
<img src="/web/20071009234858im_/http://www.landmarkcom.com/images/sm_oldvapilot.jpg" width="140" height="110" alt="Old Virginian-Pilot" border="1" hspace="4" align="right"><span class="first">W</span>hen he took over The Virginian-Pilot in 1954, Batten had a long-term objective of expanding the company, but the short-term agenda was thick. He wanted to improve content, organization and personnel. There was a need to forge teamwork from departmental fiefdoms characteristic of the times. A light sleeper who woke to make notes, Batten plunged into the newspaper agenda with unflagging energies which, he quickly learned, would have to be shared. Norfolk needed recruits for a civic cadre immersed in slum clearance, port development and a quest for expanded higher education. Virginia, meantime, was wracked with "massive resistance" to school integration. Batten gave full support to Editor Lenoir Chambers whose calm, persistent editorials won adherents to compliance with the Supreme Court's desegregation decision and, in 1960, a Pulitzer Prize. Batten also allied himself personally with state and local leaders who spoke out effectively against school closing, a result of &quot;massive resistance.&quot;</p>

<p><strong class="red2">Batten becomes first Rector of Old Dominion University</strong><br/>
<span class="first">O</span>ne of the fruits of Norfolk's intensive renewal phase was the emergence of Old Dominion University as a major urban university. Batten was this state university's first Board Chairman. In 1967, he was honored as Norfolk's First Citizen. Commitment to education - public, private and professional - spans his career. He has served as Vice Chairman of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, as President of the Board of Norfolk Academy and as a trustee of Hollins College. In 1990, he joined the Board of Visitors of The College of William and Mary, the second oldest college in the United States. Batten has been active in newspaper industry affairs, serving as Chairman of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau (now merged with the Newspaper Association of America) and a Trustee of the American Press Institute. He was elected to the Board of the Associated Press in 1975 and served as AP Chairman from 1982 to 1987.</p>

<p><strong class="red2">In '60s, Batten acquires cable, newspapers, radio</strong><br/>
<img src="/web/20071009234858im_/http://www.landmarkcom.com/images/battensr.jpg" width="75" height="120" alt="Frank Batten Sr." align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" border="1"><span class="first">N</span>ine years into his tenure as publisher, in 1963, Batten returned to his long-time goal of expanding the company. In cable television, then in its infancy, he saw a medium with growth potential as an important new communications vehicle. A year later, in its first venture outside its home base in Hampton Roads, the company acquired in Roanoke Rapids, NC, and Beckley, WV, the first franchises from which TeleCable Corporation developed. TeleCable operated 21 systems in 15 states serving 715,000 basic cable subscribers. It was spun off to Landmark stockholders as an independent corporation in 1984 and was sold to Tele-Communications Inc. in 1995. In 1965, Batten acquired The Greensboro Daily News, The Greensboro Record and WFMY-TV, all owned by the Jeffress family. Batten took a strong personal role in overhauling the newspapers' operations and in upgrading news and editorial resources. He acquired the Roanoke Times &amp; World News in 1969. Batten views the growth of Landmark as &quot;deliberate,&quot; noting that each acquisition has combined opportunities for good business results and improved products.</p>

<p><strong class="red2">Integrity, honesty and fairness stressed above all else</strong><br/>
<span class="first">D</span>espite strokes of boldness evident in his decision to create The Weather Channel and to convert to all-day newspapers in Roanoke and Greensboro, Batten's managerial style is studious, consultative and sharing. He neither drives nor dominates. &quot;His flashpoint,&quot; a long-time associate remarks, &quot;is unfairness to an employee, a customer or to the subject of a news story.&quot; That view is broadened by Batten's own formulation of Landmark's expectations of its executives: &quot;They must be honest and forthright with themselves and their people. They must own up to mistakes and correct them. They must blow the whistle on politics and manipulation of people. They must respect their employees, their peers and their customers as individuals. They must not tolerate unethical conduct. No matter how much talent they may possess, executives will not last long in Landmark unless their intentions and integrity are beyond doubt.&quot; That stress on integrity couples with Batten's cogent definition of authority for executives: &quot;Freedom and responsibility.&quot; Batten has a strong aversion to intrusion on an executive's turf. He keeps the Landmark corporate staff lean, defines its role as supportive. &quot;Our managers must have room to grow and freedom to respond to their audiences and communities. I don't want the future of the papers and stations we own to be dependent on me or on a corporate staff. Most of our enterprises are local. They should have roots and personalities reflecting their communities&quot;.</p>

<p><strong class="red2">Despite skeptics, The Weather Channel becomes a success</strong><br/>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071009234858/http://www.weather.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/web/20071009234858im_/http://www.landmarkcom.com/images/weather1.gif" width="202" height="150" alt="The Weather Channel" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="4" border="0"></a>
<span class="first">O</span>ne of Batten's deepest satisfactions is the ingenuity and tenacity of Landmark people in developing The Weather Channel from a concept into a national cable network in just 10 months. &quot;The Weather Channel was the most challenging task we had undertaken.&quot; Batten recalls. &quot;It was Landmark's first national venture, with all the complexities of marketing and distribution a national enterprise must consider. It required breakthroughs in technology. And we were determined to achieve production quality equal to the TV networks. The staff prevailed over a chorus from skeptics in the press and trade to build one of the most loyal consumer audiences in television.&quot; In 1996 The Weather Channel expanded internationally with interests in Europe and Latin America. It also is a half-owner of Pelmorex, Inc., a Canadian company that owns English and French cable networks in Canada. Batten sees Landmark's total-quality initiative - known as Continuous Improvement - as critical to the company's future. &quot;With competition heating up and technology changing fast, the media that succeed will be the ones that build competitive advantage. We have undertaken a systematic effort to be the most productive media in our markets and the best in responding to customers.&quot;</p>

<p><strong class="red2">Landmark: a commitment to innovation and excellence</strong><br/>

<span class="first">W</span>hile Batten majored on the business side, he has a keen eye for news and editorial quality and continuity. When he established an internal awards program with substantial cash prizes in honor of his uncle, he insisted on criteria based on consistent excellence rather than the &quot;occasional brilliant story or photograph.&quot; As part of that philosophy he established a Public Editor in Norfolk to invite and follow up on criticism from the public. "We need criticism," he says. &quot;The press has the power to do great harm as well as good. The First Amendment shouldn't be construed as a shield or as a sanctuary. If we're worth our salt, we will use First Amendment freedom aggressively, but through responsibility we will also conserve that constitutional privilege. Thomas Jefferson didn't invent the First Amendment for media owners, but for the people.&quot;</p>

<p><strong class="red2">Frank Batten Jr. promoted to Chairman of the Board</strong><br/>
<span class="first">O</span>n January 1, 1998, Frank Batten Jr. succeeded his father as Chairman of the Board of Landmark. Batten had been Executive Vice President of Landmark with responsibility for new ventures and new media. From 1991 to 1995, Batten was President and Publisher of The (Norfolk) Virginian-Pilot. In 1990 and 1991, he served as marketing director and then as vice president and associate publisher of the newspaper. From 1986 to 1989, he was general manager and then publisher of Landmark-owned The News-Enterprise in Elizabethtown, KY Before that, he was a reporter for The Associated Press in London for 18 months. His first position was at The Roanoke (VA) Times, where he worked as a reporter for two years and as an advertising salesman for one year. A Norfolk native, Batten Jr. received a Bachelor's degree in history from Dartmouth College and a Master's degree in business administration from the University of Virginia.
<br/><br/>
&quot;I am proud of the news, information, and advertising services that we provide to our customers,&quot; Batten Jr. said. &quot;And I am particularly proud of the people in our company who make those services possible. I intend to focus my work on three areas: developing excellent leaders and managers for Landmark's businesses, making sure we have the right strategies for those businesses, and finding new markets for Landmark to enter.&quot; Over the last two decades, Landmark has grown from its roots in newspapers and television stations into two more large businesses: The Weather Channel and Trader Publishing. In the future, I expect we will develop other substantial businesses while continuing to expand our current operations. I am excited about our prospects for growth. &quot;But as the company's makeup continues to change, what will not change are our values: pleasing customers, treating people with respect, serving the community, and running businesses with high standards of ethics and business excellence.&quot;

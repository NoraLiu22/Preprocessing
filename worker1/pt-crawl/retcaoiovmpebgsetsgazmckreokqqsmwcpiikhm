Hubbard L. Hart, owner since 1855 of a stagecoach route connecting Palatka and 
other towns to Tampa, Florida, decided in 1860 to invest in river transportation 
and founded a firm of his own: the Ocklahawa and St.Johns Navigation Co. (Hart 
Line). Odd in appearance, the ships were specially built to navigate the narrow 
and winding rivers. The Civil War period was a setback (the firm was temporarily 
based at Orange Springs and at least one contraband-carrying vessel was 
captured). The tourist trade proved a growing and profitable business, but 
Palatka � now well-connected by sea-going routes and railroads to the outside 
world � was an important harbour for goods as well. For a time, the company was 
able to withstand railroad competition.&nbsp; Hart, whose concerns had by now 
become diversified, died in 1895; the Hart Line was incorporated in 1901. The 
end came in 1920 as a result of growing automobile competition.<br>
<br>
The Hart Line house flag was white with a canting red heart in the centre 
(extract from steamship pass attached as &lt; us~hart1.jpg&gt; . Apart from this 
rectangular flag a long pennant seems to have been in use as well. See:
<a href="http://www.raeth.ch/nv30^023.jpg">http://www.raeth.ch/nv30^023.jpg</a>. 
This pennant was used as a jack.<br>

<p>Hawaii Textron (1956-59) (Source: [u9s61a])<br>
This was a short-lived attempt by the Textron conglomerate to take on Matson
Navigation's dominance of the Hawaii market just before Hawaiian statehood. In 
Rene de la Pedraja's words, &quot;the promoters did not burden Textron with 
inconvenient historical facts such as the failure of the previous challengers.&quot; 
Textron quickly decided to cut its losses and go back to businesses it knew 
something about. The flag was a W-V-W horizontal triband with a large red H 
overall.</p>

Leon Hess was probably the last of the self-made oil billionaires. The son of 
Russian Jewish immigrants, Hess started his empire during the Great Depression 
while still in his 20s buying residual oil from refineries (the leftovers after 
gasoline and other light products had been run off), loading it on his truck, 
and selling it to hotels and other businesses as heating oil. He eventually 
built up his empire to embrace exploration, refining, and retail sales and 
finally took his company public in 1962. He bought out the British company 
Amerada Petroleum in 1969, forming the company that today is Amerada Hess. Leon 
Hess died in 1999, but his company continues in business. Its tanker business 
includes six vessels with a total of 282,000 total deadweight tons. The Hess 
colors are green and yellow. The house flag in
<a href="bib-u9a.html#u9s52">US Navy's 1961 H.O.</a> was solid green with the name 
HESS in yellow. The 1963 version in <a href="bib-stb.html#ste63">
Stewart &amp; Styring (1963)</a> was white with the name in 
green and two yellow brackets around the name (I can't describe it any 
better--see the image above. Neither of these matches the current logo, 
although the 1963 flag is generally similar.</p>

<p>Howland &amp; Aspinwall (New York) (1826-1895)<br>
One of the dominant New York-based houses in China shipping in the mid-19th 
century. Both the Howland and Aspinwall families had been involved in seafaring 
enterprises in New England since before the American Revolution. The firm that 
would become Howland &amp; Aspinwall was established as G. G. &amp; S. Howland before 
1826 to carry on trade with Cuba and later to England, Le Havre, and the 
Mediterranean. William H. Aspinwall, who was married to the sister of the 
Howland brothers, joined the firm in 1832, which led to the changing of the name 
and the expansion of its business to the Far East. Howland and Aspinwall 
pioneered the new clipper design technology in the 1840s and its China clippers, 
such as the &quot;Rainbow&quot; and the &quot;Sea Witch,&quot; were famous for establishing speed records (&quot;Sea Witch&quot; 74 days, 14 hours from Hong Kong to New York in 1849). 
Howland and Aspinwall also established the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company in 1848, to connect the Isthmus of Panama to San 
Francisco, fortuitously putting the firm in an ideal position to profit from the 
discovery of gold in California the following year. W. H. Aspinwall later 
established the Panama Railroad across the isthmus, with its Atlantic terminus 
at Aspinwall (now Colon). Aspinwall was also a major benefactor of the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and a founding member of the American 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The Howland and Aspinwall 
house flag was divided quarterly, blue and white, with a white cross overall, 
bordered in blue on the white quarters. Lloyd's Register of American Yachts for 
1972 showed this flag still in use as the private signal (house flag) of Lloyd 
Aspinwall.<br>

<p>Is there source enough to determine we're not just looking at an Dominican

<p><i>Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg</i>, 20 October 2001<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I think so. The source, which I've been citing as
<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; ">
a chart of &quot;Private Signals of the Merchants of New York&quot; </span>
is a chart entitled Private Signals of the Merchants of New York, published ca 
1850 in New York and reprinted in the Time-Life book &quot;The Clipper Ships.&quot; I 
believe the compilers of the chart would have had <br>
reasonably solid info on the flag used by Hubbard &amp; Co and would not have taken 
a Dominican Republic pilot jack for the house flag.<br>

<p>Hudson River Navigation Co. (Night Line) (1902-1939), New York<br>
One of a number of steamboat lines running up and down the Hudson River between 
New York and the Albany area. Formed by merger of two earlier lines, the 
People's Line and the Citizens Line, in 1902. The term &quot;Night Line&quot; referred to 
the time of departures upstream--there was also a Day Line and an Evening Line. 
The flag was white with blue stripes at the top and bottom and an elaborate 
monogram of the company's initials on the center in red.<br>

Hurlbut and Co., founded in 1825, was one of the most important coastwise

mills in the northeast before the American Civil War. By 1846, Hurlbut had 13 
vessels in service and a ship sailing every ten days. In the late 1850s the

Havre. When

<p>The house flag of the Huron Cement Co.�s steamship division (seat, or one of 
the seats, being Detroit) can be found on
<a href="http://pics.boatnerd.com/view_album.php?set_albumName=album04&page=2">
this page</a>.
This flag is rather frayed at the fly but let us suppose it was rectangular.
White, bearing what must have been the company mark: a blue ring
containing two white circle segments above and below, leaving a red area
with the word HURON in white. I�ve seen this mark being described as the
�cement bag�.<br>
<br>
A venerable firm, Huron (Portland) Cement Co. (founded 1901 I believe) was
bought by National Gypsum Co. (1965) and that company, in its turn, was
bought by Lafarge Corp. early 1987. Ships continued sailing (<a href="http://www.boatnerd.com/pictures/fleet/townsend.htm">http://www.boatnerd.com</a>): 
&quot;<a href="us~hfi.html#inlandlakes">Inland Lakes Management</a> was formed in March of 1987 to operate and manage<br>
the Huron Cement (National Gypsum) fleet following the purchase of National 
Gypsum by <a href="us~hfl.html#lafarge">Lafarge Corp.</a>&nbsp; on January 1st, 1987.&quot;
In fact, a new cement carrier is being built now for American Transport
Leasing, a subsidiary of Lafarge which is Canadian in origin but now has
its headquarters at Herndon, Virginia (US).<br>

	<strong>The Role and Accomplishments<br/>

	<img src="/web/20150724124454im_/http://pac1944.org/jamestown/jt1608.jpg" width="291" height="264" style="float: left"/>The number of early immigrants from 17th-century Poland to America was 
	minimal. In fact, Poland served as a destination for immigrants from both 
	Western and Eastern Europe. Other nations in Europe were wasting no time in 
	exploring and colonizing the new lands across the Atlantic Ocean. Spain and 
	Portugal had taken an early lead over Britain and France, but Britain was 
	determined to make up for lost time. Its own society being split along 
	religious lines, Britain had no shortage of individuals looking for a new 
	start and freedom from religious oppression.<p class="style4">
	On December 1607, the first British settlers arrived in Jamestown in the 
	hope of finding natural resources such as gold, lumber and herbs, carrying 
	with them their ultimate goal - profit. Sent by the Virginia Company of 
	London, they arrived with large expectations. However, their inability to 
	settle a colony was larger. Two problems immediately beset the colonists. 
	First, some of the colonists were English noblemen with no experience either 
	in the military or in manual labor. Thus, the colony found itself without 
	skilled craftsmen or soldiers; worse, many of the colonists outright refused 
	to engage in work that they felt was beneath them. Second, the physical 
	location chosen for the site of Jamestown proved to be a poor one. The land 
	was swampy (making it a veritable breeding ground of disease), the water 
	supply was poor and relations with the local indigenous Indian tribes were 
	rocky at best. Within less than a year, the colony was in danger of failure. 
	No profits were heading back to England; disease ran rampant due to the lack 
	of fresh water, food supplies were low, and little to no work had been done 
	to establish an industrial base. In fact, much of the time had been spent 
	panning for gold rather unsuccessfully in Virginia�s rivers. The Virginia 
	Company of London had nothing to show for its investment and a small 
	prospect for future returns. <p class="style4">
	To salvage their colony, the Virginia Company hired a group of Poles, known 
	for their reputation and valuable expertise in the lumber and other 
	manufacturing industries. Captain John Smith had first-hand experience 
	dealing with Polish manufacturers through his work with the Virginia Company 
	of London, in addition to his experience traveling through Poland on his 
	return from the Middle East. Before his travels to America, John Smith had 
	been a Turkish prisoner. Poland provided Captain Smith with his first 
	Christian refuge following his escape.<p class="style4">
	The first Poles who arrived at Jamestown came aboard the British ship Mary 
	and Margaret on October 1, 1608 under the command of Captain Christopher 
	Newport. Bringing skilled labor and military experience lacking among the 
	original colonists, the Poles were engaged in the manufacturing of glass, 
	pitch, tar, soap, ash and other products. The English Parliament had 
	restricted the amount of English timber available for cutting, and their 
	experience in this field alone would have made the contributions of the 
	Poles invaluable. In addition, while the British settlers coming to America 
	were mainly social outcasts, some fleeing England for religious freedom, the 
	Poles &quot;[�] were members of the Polish gentry, former country squires, who, 
	besides being of intellectual class, were well acquainted with the methods 
	of production needed at the time of Jamestown [�]&quot;. In other words, the 
	Poles had no hang-ups about doing the important manual labor needed to 
	preserve the survival of the colony. <p class="style4">
	Among the first Poles who arrived in America were Michael Lowicki, an 
	organizer of industry and business and the leader of the original five; Jan 
	Bogdan, an expert in pitch, tar, and ship building; Zbigniew Stefanski, a 
	specialist in glass production; Jan Mata, a prominent soap producer, and 
	Stanislaw Sadowski a lumber and clapboard production organizer. The 
	colonists viewed the Poles as hard-working and respectful. The Poles first 
	impressions of Jamestown were not very positive. Stefanski observed, &quot;Seldom 
	has one seen such lack of resourcefulness as we found in Virginia. Not even 
	a spoonful of drinking water [�] the people here marveled when we dug a well 
	and presented it to them (�) [�]&quot;. That water well provided a regular source 
	of drinking water, stopping the spread of dysentery and other related 
	illnesses and death due to the drinking of swamp water. The Poles also set 
	up sawmills and began cutting up beams and lumber without rest, earning them 
	respect throughout the colony. Stefanski and Bogdan would later go on to 
	save Captain John Smith�s life when Smith was attacked by several Indians.<br/>
	Among major accomplishments of the first Poles was the building of a glass 
	furnace, the first factory in America and the beginning of an industry. The 
	goods produced in these factories became the first &quot;made in America&quot; goods 
	to be exported to England. When the Mary and Margaret was ready to sail back 
	to England, the Polish settlers sent back a full line of glassware samples 
	they were prepared to turn out in commercial quantities as well as a cargo 
	of pitch distilled from Virginia�s pine trees. <p class="style4">
	The colonists respected the Poles for their quality of work and other 
	accomplishments. For instance, the Pole Lawrence (Wawrzyniec) Bohun was the 
	first doctor in Jamestown colony. Moreover, the work done by the original 
	group proved valuable enough to allow them to repay the Virginia Company for 
	their passage to America, and this in turn allowed them to later become free 
	citizens of the colony. Within a few years, there were fifty Poles living in 
	Jamestown. Also important was the example these Poles set for the colonists. 
	As the former President of the College of William and Mary Admiral Alvin 
	Chandler stated in 1953, &quot;It took the example of the Polish glassmakers to 
	demonstrate to the colonists that the treasures of Virginia were in its 
	soil, not in nuggets to be had for picking.&quot;<p class="style4">
	On June 30, 1619, when the Jamestown Legislative Assembly instituted a 
	representative form of government, rules stated that only colonists of 
	English descent would be given the right to vote. This denied Poles the 
	right to governmental representation in a colony they helped to sustain and 
	grow. As a result they organized what became the first labor strike in 
	American history. Their slogan was &quot;No vote. No work&quot;. 
	<p class="style4">
	Facing angry and influential politicians in England, within a few weeks the 
	Jamestown government bowed to the demands of Poles, granting them the same 
	rights given to all workers within the colony. It is important to note that 
	this event was not a strike against unfair employers or work place 
	practices, but a battle for civil rights and inclusion in the political 
	process. As Admiral Chandler stated: &quot;�practically all of the profits 
	realized by the London Company came from the resale of the products of the 
	Polish industries. The Jamestown government quickly realized that if it sent 
	empty ships back to England, the consequences could be very unpleasant&quot;. 
	These Polish craftsmen used the economic power they had acquired through 
	their labor to engineer an equal footing as citizens for themselves.<p class="style4">
	While the history of Jamestown itself proves to be a tragic one in the end, 
	the tradition, practices and actions of these original settlers lives on. 
	Despite early setbacks (in 1610 John Smith left the colony as a result of a 
	grave injury and only 65 colonists survived the next two winters) the colony 
	gave rise to similar establishments and taught valuable lessons. Because of 
	tragic events the Virginia Company lost its charter in 1624, the Pamunkee 
	Indian tribe devastated the colony in 1644 and in 1676 Jamestown was burned 
	to the ground in Bacon�s Rebellion, destroying one of America�s first great 
	settlements. By 1698, the surviving colonists had moved closer to the land 
	now known as Williamsburg. The significance of Jamestown lies in its 
	strategic timing and success. As Louis B. Wright, Professor of American 
	History stated, &quot;If Jamestown had failed, Spain and France ultimately might 
	have divided all of North America between them and the United States might 
	never have come into being.&quot; <p class="style4">
	The Polish contribution to Jamestown and the fabric of early America makes 
	it a cornerstone of the American experience. The saving of Jamestown after 
	its first disastrous year was due in large part to the efforts of those 
	original Poles. Fresh water from the well, the beginnings of industry, even 
	the saving of the life of the Jamestown hero Captain John Smith all resulted 
	from the actions of these men. The example they showed by their industrious 
	work ethic and their efforts to gain and retain their own individual freedom 
	provided a model for generations of later colonists and Americans. Their 
	labor strike for political freedom foreshadowed the events of the 
	Revolutionary War, when colonists would unite to stand up for the freedom of 
	a Nation of People.</p>

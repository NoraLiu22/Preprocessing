<h2>
<a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The <b>Holy Roman Empire</b> (official name: <i>sacrum romanum imperium,
</i>1254;
<a href="#Name">more
details below</a>) designates a political entity that covered a large portion
of Europe, centered on Germany, from 962 to 1806.
<h3>
Origin and Evolution</h3>
The Holy Roman Empire originates in the eastern half of Charlemagne's empire,
divided after his death. In 800, Charlemagne had received from the pope
the title of Emperor (<i>Imperator Augustus</i>), reminiscent of the title
held by Roman emperors, both in the Rome of old and in the Byzantium of
the time. By 911 eastern and western Franconia, as the area was known,
had completely separated, the latter continuing as the kingdom of the Franks,
or France; the former continuing as the kingdom of Germany. In 962 Otto
I the Great reclaimed the imperial dignity which had lost all prestige
and was conferred by popes on bit players in Italian politics. This is
usually taken to be the founding date of the Holy Roman Empire.
<p>The Holy Roman Empire (<b>HRE</b>) never achieved the political unification
that France did; a prolonged attempt at centralizing authority starting
with Maximilian I (1493-1519) was wrecked by the Reformation and the ensuing
wars, culminating with the Thirty Years War (1618-48) and the Treaty of
Westphalia (1648). The latter formalized the relationship between the Emperor
and his vassals, who thereby achieved all but complete sovereignty. As
a result, the HRE was still composed at the end of the 18th century of
around 360 distinct entities, differing widely in size, rank and power.
Some were kings and princes, other were counts; some were clerics, other
were secular rulers.
</p><h3>
The nature of the Holy Roman Empire: limited elective monarchy</h3>
The HRE evolved over time into a <i>limited elective monarchy</i>, and
at the same time a state composed of many states. At its head stood an
elected <b>emperor </b>(<i>Kaiser</i>), who was the sole sovereign and
monarch of Germany. The exercise of his power was considerably limited,
however, by a body representing the member states, the <b>Imperial Diet</b>&nbsp;
(<i>Reichstag</i>). Although the various princes and lords of the Empire
were all his vassals and subjects, they possessed a number of privileges
that brought them close to de facto sovereignty; in particular, the emperor
could not intervene in their particular affairs as long as they ruled according
to the law.
<p>The Empire was an <i>elective</i> monarchy since the end of the Carolingian
dynasty in the early 10th century, although the principle was not firmly
set in writing until the constitution of 1338 and the Golden Bull of 1356
(see a <a href="http://www.altfrankfurt.com/Spezial/Kaiserkroenung/GoldeneBulle.htm">picture
here</a> and <a href="#bull">the text here</a>). Later, as part of every
electioral capitulation, the newly elected emperor swore not to make his
office hereditary.
</p><p>The Empire was also a <i>limited</i> monarchy, in the sense that any
exercise of the Emperor's powers that was not purely executive required
the assent of the States of the Empire. This principle was only formulated
at the peace of Westphalia in 1648, where (art. 8, sect. 2) the circumstances
requiring the assent (and not merely the advice) of the States were listed
explicitly. This assent could be expressed either by the States assembled
in the Reichstag, or through a duly constituted <i>deputation</i>; the
latter means rarely employed after the Diet became permanent in 1663. Assent
was determined by majority voting, except in specific matters where consensus
was required, mainly in religious matters.
</p><p>Parts <a href="#Emperor">1</a>, <a href="#Reichstag">2</a> and <a href="#Courts">3</a>
of this page are devoted to the Constitution of the Empire: executive,
legislative and judicial branches of government, respectively. Part
<a href="#Structure">4</a>
looks at the geographical and political structure of the Empire: that is,
the sub-units that made it up.

<h3>
The Official&nbsp;<a name="Name"></a>Name of the Holy Roman Empire</h3>
The word <i>imperium</i> appears in official documents of Otto I, but it
denotes the imperial power, not the territory. After Henry II's death some
Italian magnates offered the crown of Italy to the son of the duke of Aquitaine,
and swore to help him acquire the "imperium" of the Romans; here, the word
meant the title itself.
<p>One has to wait until Conrad II to find <i>Romanum imperium</i> used
to designate the lands ruled by the emperor (documents of 1034 and 1038).
Curiously, the expression <i>Romana res publica</i> is used with the same
meaning contemporaneously. The use of the phrase <i>Romanum imperium</i>
remains rare under Henry II (in 1049, 1053) and successors until Frederic
I. It is however, occasionally used in non-official documents, such as
letters, chronicles, even Papal encyclicals (in 1076).
</p><p>At the same tine, one finds the expression <i>Romanum regnum</i> (Roman
realm) in an official document of 1041. In 1045, the signature of the emperor
is described as <i>signum regis invictissimi Henrici tertii, Burgundiorum
primi, Romanorum secundi</i>. Correspondingly, the title
<i>Rex Romanorum</i>
makes its apparition in 1040, and is officially adopted in the Intitulatio
in 1041 and in the monogram in 1043.
</p><p>The use of <i>Romanum imperium</i> becomes considerably more frequent
under Frederic I Barbarossa (in 1152, 1155, 1157-9, 1162),&nbsp; In 1157,
one finds a concurrent use of <i>sacrum imperium et diva res publica</i>
(holy empire and holy commonwealth). The phrase <i>sacrum imperium</i>
is found again in 1161, 1164, 1174, 1184-6. In 1159, one finds <i>sacratissimum
imperium</i>, a phrase occasionally encountered until Otto IV.
</p><p>The two expressions <i>Romanum imperium</i> and <i>sacrum imperium</i>
are used concurrently in official documents for a century, but one does
not find the two together until 1254: <i>sacrum Romanum imperium</i>. From
that date, the new phrase never falls out of use although the shorter formulas
continue to be used commonly.
</p><p>Official documents in the German language show the phrase <i>heiliges
Reich</i> or <i>R&ouml;misches Reich</i> frequently in documents of Ludwig
of Bavaria, but <i>heiliges R&ouml;misches Reich</i> is rare; it first
appears in 1340. It becomes common with Charles IV (1347).
</p><p>The last transformation of the official name of the Empire took place
in the late 15th c. A Reformation issued at the Reichstag of Frankfurt
in 1442 speaks of <i>dem heiligen R&ouml;mischen Reich und Deutschen Landern</i>.
A similar phrase appears at the Reichstag of 1471: <i>des heiligen R&ouml;mischen
Reichs und der widrigen Teutschen Nation</i> (in Latin: <i>sacri Romani
imperii ac celeberrimae nationis Germanicae</i>), and in the Landsfriede
of N&uuml;rnberg of 1487: <i>dem heiligen Reiche und deutscher Nation</i>,
the Landsfriede of 1486: <i>das R&ouml;mische Reich Teutscher Nation,</i>
the Worms diet of 1497: <i>das heilige Reich Teutscher Nation</i>, and
the K&ouml;ln diet of 1512: <i>des heiligen R&ouml;mischen Reichs Teutscher
Nation</i>. The phrase entered the Wahlkapitulation of 1519, by which the
emperor promised to reside within <i>dem heiligen R&ouml;mischen Reiche
Teutscher Nation</i>.
</p><p>From the late 16th c. to the 18th c. jurists debated the meaning of
the phrase. Other early 16th c. documents suggest that it originally may
have meant the German part of the Empire, with <i>deutsche Nation</i> in
opposition to <i>fremde Nation</i>. Interestingly, the debate in the 17th
c. was whether the phrase meant that Germany happened to be
<b>an</b> empire,
or whether <b>the</b> Empire happened to be located mainly in Germany.
Increasingly, jurists and writers used the phrase <i>imperium Romano-Germanicum</i>.
Significantly, the final acts of the Holy Roman Empire, namely the <a href="http://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/rechtsphilosophie/hdoc/reichsdeputationshauptschluss1803.html" target="new">Reichsdeputationshauptschlu&szlig;
of 1803</a>, the note of the French ambassador of August 1, 1806 and the
abdication of Francis II, all use the phrase <i>Deutsches Reich</i> (<i>confederation
germanique</i>) rather than the formal title.

1. The&nbsp;<a name="Emperor"></a>Emperor</h2>

<h3>
<a name="Qualifications"></a>Qualifications</h3>
The <b>Emperor</b> had to be a worthy man, aged 18 or more, reside in the
Empire, be of noble birth (all four grandparents had to be noble, according
to the Schwabenspiegel), and of lay status (this was not explicitly stated).
No law required that he be Catholic, and, although the text in a number
of laws assumes that the emperor is Catholic, jurists saw no obstacle to
the choice of a Protestant prince. Nor did he have to be German, as the
examples of Alfonso of Castile and Charles V showed.&nbsp; By the 17th
century, however, it seemed wise for any candidate to possess an estate
within the boundaries of the Empire: when the French weighed in 1648 whether
to let Alsace remain within the Empire, it was because it might allow the
king of France to be a candidate for the throne.&nbsp; Similarly, in 1737
the duke of Lorraine was allowed to retain the county of Falkenstein so
as not to jeopardize his future candidacy (Schoell 1:151, 2:252).
<p>The office was not hereditary, but elective. However, from 1453 to 1740,
a Habsburg was always Emperor. The last Habsburg Charles VI died leaving
only daughters, and the Elector of Bavaria was elected as Charles VII in
1742, but he died in 1745 and Charles VI's son-in-law Francis of Lorraine
was elected emperor in 1745; until the end of the Empire in 1806, the imperial
crown was in the Habsburg-Lorraine family.
</p><h4>
Beginning and End of Reign</h4>
The reign began with the swearing of the <i>Wahlkapitulation</i>, or electoral
capitulation, a kind of contract between the Emperor and the Empire.&nbsp;
Even a minor could take the oath (as did the 12-year old Joseph I in 1690),
although he also promised to renew his oath upon assuming power.&nbsp;
This oath preceded the coronation, led by the archbishop of Mainz. The
imperial cities took an oath of loyalty at the time of coronation, but
not the states of the empire, since each took such an oath at the time
they inherited their fief.
<p>The reign ended by death, abdication (Charles V in 1555) or deposition
of the emperor. The latter could be declared by the Reichstag, although
earlier texts (<i>Schwabenspiegel</i> and <i>Sachsenspiegel</i>, as well
as the Golden Bull c5, &sect;3<i>) </i>speak of a jurisdiction of the Count
Palatine of the Rhine over the emperor, which was never formally abolished.
</p><h4>
Successors and Replacements: the&nbsp;<a name="King_of_the_Romans"></a>King
of the Romans, the Vicars of the Empire</h4>
When a successor was elected during the lifetime of the Emperor, he bore
the title of <b>King of the Romans</b> (<i>Rex Romanorum, r&ouml;mischer
K&ouml;nig</i>).
<p>The election of a successor in the lifetime of the empire was practised
up to Frederic II's sons Heinrich in 1220 and Konrad in 1237. It was then
abandoned except for Wenceslas in 1376. The Habsburgs resumed it, with
Charles V's brother Ferdinand's election in 1531, followed by Maximilian
II in 1562, Ferdinand III in 1636, Ferdinand IV in 1653 [who died before
his father], and Joseph I in 1690.
</p><p>The King of the Romans bore his arms on a shield on the breast of a
single-headed eagle sable (as opposed to the double-headed eagle of the
Emperor). He had royal rank and came immediately after the Emperor in precedence.
He succeeded the emperor immediately, without need for another coronation
or <i>Wahlkapitulation</i>, since he had already been crowned and sworn
a capitulation at the time of his election. He also ruled the empire in
case the emperor was incapacitated (as did Joseph I in the last days of
his father's reign), but stayed out of the government of the empire otherwise,
according to the oath he took upon election.
</p><p>If no king of the Romans existed, and if either the Emperor was incapacitated
or under age (<i>sede pleana</i>), or there was no emperor (<i>sede vacante</i>,
case of an <i>interregnum</i>), the imperial authority was held jointly
by two <b>Imperial Vicars</b> (<i>Reichsvikarien</i>), although exercised
in the name of the emperor in the first case. By virtue of the Golden Bull,
these were the Elector Palatine and the Elector of Saxony, and each had
special authority over a part of the empire, depending on which type of
law was in force: the Elector Palatine in regions of Franconian law (Franconia,
Swabia, the Rhine, southern Germany), while the Elector of Saxony in regions
of Saxon law (Saxony, Westphalia, northern Germany, Hannover). The boundaries
between the two areas (particularly in Hesse, Julich, Cleve, Berg, Li&eacute;ge,
Ostfriesland) were disputed until 1750, and some regions (Bohemia, Austria)
did not recognize any vicar. In Italy, the titular vicar was the duke of
Savoy.
</p><p>In 1623 the Elector Palatine lost his electorship to Bavaria, and in
1648 a new electorship was created for him. Thereafter Bavaria and Pfalz
were in dispute as to who was vicar. In the 1659 interregnum both claimed
to be vicars and issued documents on that authority, but the arch-chancellor
and the other vicar recognized Bavaria, as did emperor Leopold after his
election. In 1724 a family pact between the two branches of the Wittelsbach
family set forth joint exercise of the vicariate, but this was not accepted
by the Reichstag. In 1745 the two branches agreed to alternate, with Bavaria
starting first in the 1745 interregnum. This was accepted by Francis I
after his election and by the electors, and later confirmed in 1752 by
the Reichstag. In 1777 the Bavarian branch became extinct and the agreement
moot.
</p><p>The imperial vicars exercised the powers of the emperor that were not
explicitly reserved to his person, and in doing so were bound by the terms
of the deceased emperor's capitulation. They handled all matters of grace:
legitimations, emancipations, privileges, ennoblements and titles, etc.
They exercised the emperor's judicial powers, they collected taxes in his
name, nominated to ecclesiastical benefices, and invested vassals with
imperial fiefs, whether inherited or newly conceded (except for principalities
and Fahnlehen). The emperor was formally obliged to ratify the acts of
the vicars after his election, although there are instances of such acts
being repealed by the Reichshofrat. The vicariate ended once the new emperor
had sworn to uphold his electoral capitulation.
</p>

<h3> <a name="Household"></a>Household</h3>

<p>
The emperor was entitled to have a Household, a real one as well as one
"for show" composed of the <i>High Offices of the Empire</i> (<i>Erz&auml;mter</i>,
<i>archiofficia</i>).  The four High Offices appear under the Ottonian dynasty:
at the coronation of Otto I in 936, each of the <i>Stammherz&ouml;ge</i> held
one of the functions.  The Golden Bull of 1356 assigned them to the lay electors 
(in fact, some
electors may have become so because they were High Officers). After a new
electorate was created for the count Palatine, a new office of Arch-Treasurer
was created for him, in 1652. In 1706, after Bavaria was banned, the elector
palatine resumed his office of Arch-Steward, and the office of Arch-Treasurer
passed in 1710 to the newly created elector of Hanover. In 1714, Bavaria
was reinstated, and the elector palatine resumed the office of Treasurer,
but Hanover continued to use the title and augmentation of arms until the
merger of the Bavarian and Palatine electorates in 1777 allowed Hanover
to exercise the office. New offices were planned but never chosen for the
electors created in 1803.

</p><p>&nbsp;In the exercise of these functions outside of the coronations,
the lay electors were represented by the holders of corresponding

</p><p>The hereditary lands of Austria (Upper and Lower Austria, Styria, Carinthia,

<p>The arms of the Emperor were a double-headed eagle or on a field sable,
charged with an escutcheon bearing his personal arms.
</p><h3>
<a name="Powers"></a>Powers</h3>
The powers of the Emperor were exercised in a broad range of areas, but
restricted everywhere:
<dl><dt>
<i>executive</i>:</dt><dd>
he enforced the laws and rulings of the empire, although most of this was
delegated to the Reichskreise;</dd><dd>
he appointed imperial officers;</dd><dt>
<i>legislative</i>:</dt><dd>
he could propose, approve and promulgate laws; in particular, he had the
right to withhold approval;</dd><dd>
but he could not levy taxes without approval</dd><dt>
<i>judiciary</i>:</dt><dd>
he was the ultimate judge in Germany, although he could only exercise this
power through legally appointed courts, and had no right to intervene in
the Reichskammergericht, but had in certain cases the final word in the
Reichshofrat;</dd><dd>
he had the right of pardon, as well as the right to confer exemptions and
privileges (i.e., exceptions to the application of imperial laws);</dd><dt>
<i>international</i>:</dt><dd>
he alone represented the Empire abroad, although his ability to make war,
peace and alliances was very limited;</dd><dt>
<i>feudal</i>:</dt><dd>
he was overlord of all imperial fiefs.</dd></dl>

<h4>
Jura reservata</h4>
The emperor had certain powers that flowed from his position as sovereign
of the empire, from his <i>plenitudo potestatis</i>. Over time, this "plenitude
of power" became restricted. By the 17th c., the powers of the emperor
which were specifically his were called <i>jura reservata</i> or reserved
rights; they were opposed to the powers of the Reichstag on one hand, the
powers of the individual territories on the other.
<p>The reserved rights were divided into the unrestricted (jura reservata
illimita) and restricted (<i>jura reservata limita</i>) depending on whether
the Reichstag was involved or not. They were also divided into exclusive
(<i>jura reservata exclusiva</i>) or concurrent (<i>jura reservata communia</i>),
depending on whether the individual territories also enjoyed those rights
or not.
</p><p>Examples of such imperial powers include:
</p><ul>
<li>
<i>jura reservata illimita + exclusiva</i>: ennoblement and conferral of
titles, foundation of universities</li>

<li>
<i>jura reservata limita</i>: imposition of tolls, leasing of mints</li>

<li>
<i>jura reservata communia</i>: grant legal majority, legitimize children,
appoint notaries, grant arms</li>
</ul>

<p>The emperor delegated the exercise of these rights to officials
called counts palatine (<i>Hofpfalzgrafen</i>). Such delegated powers were
called <i>comitiva</i>, and distinguished into the <i>comitiva minor</i>
(power to grant majority, legitimize, appoint notaries, grant arms) and
<i>comitiva
major</i> (ennoblement and power to delegate the <i>comitiva minor</i>).
The <i>comitiva minor</i> was commonly bestowed to rulers of territories
or titular counts, as well as attached to certain positions (such as provosts
of universities). The <i>comitiva major</i> was rarely bestowed, and it
was hereditary in the houses of Pfalz and Schwarzburg.
</p><h3>
<a name="titles"></a>Titles and Styles</h3>
See also the page on the <a href="/topics/royalty/emperor.htm">title of
emperor</a> for the broader history of the title of "emperor".
<p>Charles, king of the Franks, received the title of Emperor on Christmas
Day 800 from Leo III in St. Peter's in Rome. According to his biographer
Einhard (<i>Vita Karoli Magni</i>, <a href="http://www.phil.uni-erlangen.de/%7Ep1ges/quellen/kdg_frame.html">par.
28</a>) Charlemagne was taken by surprise and would never had entered the
church that day had he known was the pope was up to. Nevertheless, he accepted
the title. His official style in documents, as emperor, was: <i>Imperator
Augustus Romanum gubernans Imperium</i> or <i>serenissimus Augustus a Deo
coronatus, magnus pacificus Imperator Romanorum gubernans Imperium</i>.
(All the Western original sources on Charlemagne's coronation are <a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/mittelalter/personen/schmitz/vl9899/qu-1-1.htm">available</a>).
The title of Emperor was confirmed by Byzantium in 812.
</p><p>Otto I, in 962, assumed the style of <i>imperator augustus</i>. In 966
he also used the style <i>imperator augustus Romanorum ac Francorum</i>,
but reverted the same year to the previous, simpler style, which his successors
kept. By the 12th century, the standard style was <i>Dei gratia Romanorum
imperator semper augustus</i>, and it remained until the 16th c.
</p><p>Throughout the Middle Ages, the convention was that the (elected) king
of Germany (a kingdom formed by the division of the empire in 843 and the
separation of the western Franconian kingdom in 888) was also Emperor of
the Romans. His title was royal (king of the Germans, or from 1237 king of the Romans)
from his election to his coronation in Rome by the pope; thereafter, he
was emperor. After the death of Frederic II in 1250, however, formal coronation
by the pope happened less frequently: Henry VII in 1312, Charles IV in
1355, Sigismund in 1433, Frederick III in 1452, Charles V in 1530. The
title of "king of the Romans" became less and less reserved for the emperor-elect
but uncrowned in Rome; the emperor-elect was either known as German king or simply
styled himself "imperator" (see the example of Ludwig IV below).  The reign
was dated to begin either from the day of election (Philipp, Rudolf of Habsburg)
or the day of the coronation (Otto IV, Heinrich VII, Ludwig IV, Karl IV).  The
election day became the starting date permanently with Siegmund.
</p>

<p> Ultimately,
Maximilian I changed the style of the emperor in 1508, with papal approval:
after his German coronation, his style was <i>Dei
gratia Romanorum imperator electus semper augustus</i>.
That is, he was "emperor elect": a term that did not imply that he was
emperor-in-waiting or not yet fully emperor, but only that he was
emperor by virtue of the election rather than papal coronation (by
tradition, the style of <i>rex Romanorum electus</i> was retained 
between the election and the German coronation).&nbsp; At the same time,&nbsp;
the custom of having the heir-apparent elected as <a href="#King_of_the_Romans">king
of the Romans</a> in the emperor's lifetime resumed. For this reason, the
title <i>king of the Romans</i> (<i>Rex Romanorum</i>, sometimes <i>king
of the Germans</i> or <i>Rex Teutonicorum</i>) came to mean heir-apparent,
the successor elected while the emperor was still alive.
</p><p>The German translation of the imperial style was <i>Von Gottes Gnaden
(erw&auml;hlter) R&ouml;mischer Kaiser, zur aller Zeit Mehrer des Reichs.</i>&nbsp;
The peculiar "translation" of <i>semper augustus</i> appears on a Lehenbrief
(letter of enfeoffment) of 1301 in the form <i>zu allen ziden ein merer
des heiligen Romischen riches</i>.
</p><p>The emperor had precedence over all Christian monarchs. The emperor's
wife, the Empress, also had rank, but not his children, since the office
was elective.

<p>
</p><h2>
2. The&nbsp;<a name="Reichstag"></a>Reichstag</h2>
The <b>Reichstag</b> was, in modern terms, the legislative body of the
Empire. It should not be thought of as a representative institution in
the modern sense, because many individuals and communities were not represented
in it, yet its decisions were binding on all subjects of the Empire, and
it was the only institution with which the Emperor dealt.
<p>The composition of the <b>Reichstag</b> evolved over the Middle Ages.
By 1495 it had been divided into three colleges or sections:
</p><ol>
<li>
the <a href="#Electors">Electoral Council</a> (<i>Kurf&uuml;rstenrat</i>),</li>

<li>
the <a href="#Princes">Council of Princes</a> (<i>F&uuml;rstenrat</i>),</li>

<li>
the <a href="#Cities">Council of the Imperial Cities</a> (C<i>ollegium
der Reichst&auml;dte</i>).</li>
</ol>

<h3>
A. The&nbsp;<a name="reichsstand"></a>States of the Empire</h3>
A <b>State of the Empire</b> (<i>Reichsstand, status Imperii</i>) was a
member having a seat and a vote at the <i>Reichstag</i> (<i>Sitz und Stimme</i>).&nbsp;
The corresponding adjective is <i>reichsst&auml;ndisch. 
</i>A few imperial
officers, such as the hereditary marshal (Pappenheim) and the hereditary usher
(Werthern), had seat without vote, and as such were not <i>reichsst&auml;ndisch</i> (Pappenheim, however, was able to obtain recognition as a 
mediatized family in Bavaria in 1831).
<p>The status of State of the Empire was originally attached to a particular
land, and was a right of the owner or ruler of that land.&nbsp; Consequently:
</p><ul>
<li>
when several individuals jointly ruled the land they shared the vote;</li>

<li>
conversely, the owner of several lands with votes attached exercised several
votes;</li>

<li>
the religion of a state was a characteristic of the state, not the owner
(the electors of Saxony were Catholics in the 18th century, but their state
continued to be regarded as Protestant);</li>

<li>
the vote was inherited by the next possessor of the land; but for states
created after 1648, it was usually considered that the vote belonged to
a specific family, and could not be inherited outside of the original family.</li>
</ul>
Since 1653, admission to the Reichstag was not solely dependent on the
emperor's will, but required qualification and cooptation by the Reichstag.
The requirements were up to the individual colleges.  Actual exercise
of the rights to sit and vote was not necessary.
<ul>
<li>
The creation of a new electorate required the approval of all three colleges.</li>

<li>
The creation of a new prince with individual vote required</li>

<ul>
<li>
the possession of a significant immediate territory,</li>

<li>
commitment to share in the financial and military burdens of the Empire
(by being entered into the imperial <i>Matrikel</i> of taxes and military
obligations),</li>

<li>
adherence to one of the 10 <a href="#Circles">Circles</a> (<i>Reichskreise</i>)</li>

<li>
the approval of the college of electors and the college of princes.</li>
</ul>

<li>
The creation of a new count in addition required the acceptance into one
of the counts' benches.</li>
</ul>
Since 1653, the Emperor was forbidden in principle from making individuals
into states (so-called <i>reichsst&auml;ndische Personalisten</i>), without
the possession of a territory (an imperial knighthood was not enough).&nbsp;
There were exceptions, however: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Auersperg was given in 1663 the lordship of
Tengen as an imperial county, which allowed him to earn a seat and
individual vote in the Reichstag, but the territory itself remained
part
of the Habsburg dominions in Swabia;</li>
  <li>Lorraine-Nom&eacute;ny (created for the Habsburg-Lorraine
family in 1736) was a personalist prince with an individual vote;</li>
  <li>there
were several personalists in the
college of counts of Franconia, who had been admitted before they had
acquired sufficient territory: Ursin von Rosenberg, Windischgr&auml;tz,
Starhemberg, Wurmbrand, Giech, Khevenh&uuml;ller, Colloredo,
P&uuml;ckler, Harrach, Neipperg.</li>
</ul>
After qualification and cooptation, the quality of State of the Empire
was retained, whether or not the cooptation was followed by a formal admission,
whether or not the seat was taken or the vote exercised.
<p>A territory could lose the quality of State of the Empire
</p><ul>
<li>
by being put under the imperial ban (<i>Reichsacht</i>), or banned, by
the Emperor and the Reichstag; the most famous examples being the Palatinate
in 1623, and Bavaria and Cologne in 1706;</li>

<li>
by being ceded to a foreign power, unless explicit provisions to the contrary
were made, as when Sweden acquired a vote in the Reichstag after 1648;</li>

<li>
by being mediatized, i.e., becoming subject to the authority of another
State; however, mediatization did not necessarily imply loss of the quality
of State of the Empire; in such a case, the State was called <i>Mediatstand</i>
or <i>mittelbare Stand</i>.&nbsp; Examples include the houses of Stolberg, Sch&ouml;nburg
(1740) and Giech (1791);</li>

<li>
by being inherited by another family, for states created after 1648, unless
the beneficiary of a <i>Prorogation</i>, subject to the same qualification
for the new holder.</li>
</ul>
The privileges of the States of the Empire, guaranteed by the <i>Wahlkapitulation</i>,
were:
<ul>
<li>
to have seat and vote at the Reichstag; the vote could be individual (<i>Virilstimme</i>)
or shared (<i>Curiatstimme</i>)</li>

<li>
to be suspended or deprived of their status only by their peers (except
in cases of misuse of certain regalian rights like minting and tolls, in
which case the Emperor or the imperial court could order the suspension)</li>

<li>
to have their successoral treaties (<i>Erbverbr&uuml;derungen</i>) automatically
approved by the Emperor;</li>

<li>
precedence over all subjects of the Empire</li>

<li>
autonomy with respect to their family affairs;</li>

<li>
the right to form alliances with foreigners as well as with other states
of the Empire (union of electors, union of princes, union of counts, the
Hanse)</li>

<li>
the right to assemble themselves by college</li>

<li>
since 1648, the right to vote by religion (a procedure called <i>itio in
partes</i>): within each body (the <i>corpus catholicorum</i> and the <i>corpus
evangelicorum</i>), decisions were taken by majority vote, and if the two
bodies disagreed no decision could be taken by the Reichstag.&nbsp; The
procedure could be invoked on any matter, not only on religious matters.&nbsp;
The archbishop of Mainz presided over the Catholic body, the elector of
Saxony (even when he was a Catholic) over the Protestant body.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
B. The&nbsp;<a name="Electors"></a>Electors</h3>

<p>
The Emperor was chosen by the Elector princes (<i>Kurf&uuml;rsten</i>).
This institution emerges sometime in the first half of the 13th c.,
as a consequence of the crisis of 1198.  It appears in the <i>Sachsenspiegel</i>,
a compilation of German feudal law written between 1220 and 1235.  Its 
composition seems to have been set fairly early, by the 1230s at the latest.
Initially the electors nominated a candidate, subject to ratification by
the magnates, but fairly quickly their choice became final.
Its formal regulation came with the Golden Bull of 1356,
although changes were made occasionally.   by the late 15th c., the 
electors were understood to form a distinct college.
</p>

<p>
The composition was set as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>
Three spiritual or cleric electors:</li>

<ul>
<li>
bishop of Mainz</li>
<li>
bishop of Trier</li>
<li>
bishop of K&ouml;ln</li>
</ul>
<li>
Four temporal or lay electors:</li>
<ul>
<li>
king of Bohemia</li>
<li>
count Palatine of the Rhine</li>
<li>
elector of Saxony</li>
<li>
margrave of Brandenburg</li>
</ul>
</ul>
The Council was presided by the archbishop of Mainz, who had precedence
over all electors.
<p></p>

<p>The status of the king of Bohemia was controversial for a long time, because
he was not (necessarily) German; on the other hand, he was the Butler of the
Empire, and one theory founded the right to elect the Emperor on holding one
of the four high offices.  One view was that the king of Bohemia's vote
was meant to be the deciding vote in case of an even split of the other six.
The Sachsenspiegel did not include him as an elector, but the Schwabenspiegel
did.  It took the Golden Bull of 1356 to settle the matter definitively.
The king of Bohemia  did not attend the elections after Wenceslas in
the 14th c., and in the 17th century was not present for the deliberations,
until 7 Sep 1708, when Bohemia was admitted again as a full member of the
Electoral college.
</p><p>Changes to the list of electors were made in the 17th and 18th c.
</p><ul>
<li>
On 23 Jan 1621, during the Thirty Years War, the count Palatine was banned
and in 1623 his vote was transferred to his cousin the duke of Bavaria,
of a junior line of the Wittelsbach. At the conclusion of the war at the
peace of Westphalia in 1648, an 8th electorate was created and conferred
on the count Palatine by way of restitution, with reversionary rights on
the electorate of Bavaria. On extinction of the Bavarian line in 1777,
the 8th electorate disappeared as the electore Palatine inherited the electorate
of Bavaria.</li>

<li>
On 19 Dec 1692 the emperor conferred on the house of Braunschweig-L&uuml;neburg
(Hannover) a 9th electorate, which was only recognized by the Diet in on
12 April 1710.</li>

<li>
On 29 April 1706 the electors of Cologne and Bavaria were banned and lost
their votes, but they were reinstated by the peace of Baden in 1714.</li>

<li>
In 1801, the Lun&eacute;ville peace treaty ceded to France the left bank
of the Rhine, leading to the extinction of the electorates of Trier and
K&ouml;ln, and the transfer of the electorate of Mainz to the see of Regensburg.
The <a href="http://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/rechtsphilosophie/hdoc/reichsdeputationshauptschluss1803.html" target="new"><i>Reichsdeputationshauptschlu&szlig;</i>
of 1803</a> created 4 electorates for W&uuml;rtemberg, Baden, Hessen-Kassel
and Salzburg (a newly created temporal principality held by the former
grand-duke of Tuscany), who never exercised their votes.</li>
</ul>
The number of electors was set at 7 in 1356, changed to 8 in 1648, 9 in
1708, 8 in 1777, 6 in 1801 and 10 in 1803.
<p>The powers and rights of the electors were:
</p><ul>
<li>
to elect the emperor and to establish the <i>Wahlkapitulation</i> with
him (their right to modify the capitulation was not universally accepted);</li>

<li>
to hold one of the <a href="#Household">High Offices</a>;</li>

<li>
to have royal rank and precedence, although only Bohemia was a kingdom,
and be protected by statutes against lese majesty;</li>

<li>
to propose legislation and to be consulted on all important affairs by

<h3><a name="elections"></a>Elections and Coronations</h3>

<p>
The electors elected the king of Germany or king of the Romans who, once
crowned, became the Emperor.&nbsp; Under the Habsburgs, it had become usual
for the Emperor to have his oldest son crowned as king of the Romans.&nbsp;
At the peace of Westphalia, France and Sweden tried to have the right to
elect the king of the Romans transferred to the Reichstag, without success.&nbsp;
Finally, the electoral capitulation of 1711 included the stipulation that
an election would take place only in case of extended absence, advanced
age, permanent incapacity of the Emperor, or other urgent necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was up to the electors to decide to hold an election. They were obligated
to give the emperor prior notification, but could proceed without his approval.

</p><p>The electors were free to elect whom they wished, and the Emperor, in
his capitulation, promised not to interfere with this freedom or use any
form of coercion.&nbsp; They could, nevertheless, pledge their vote: when
Brunswick (later Hanover) was given an electorate in 1692, it promised
in return never to vote for anyone else but the eldest-born archduke of
Austria.&nbsp; (In the election of 1742, there were none, and the elector
of Hanover was free to cast his vote).&nbsp; A spiritual elector could
vote even before having been invested by the Pope and received the pallium,
as long as he had been invested by the Emperor.&nbsp; Conversely, an archbishop
deprived of his electorate but not of his see could not be replaced as
elector and his vote was forfeited (as happened to Cologne in 1711).&nbsp;
A minor's vote was cast by his tutor.
</p>

<p>The electors were summoned by the archbishop of Mainz, or else by the
archbishop of Trier, normally within a month of the death of the Emperor.&nbsp;
The electors met in Frankfurt, as prescribed by the Golden Bull (when they didn't, the city protested and
it was granted reversals reserving its rights for the future) normally within three
months of notification.&nbsp; The Grand Marshal was responsible for the
logistics and protection of the electors and their suites.&nbsp; Electors
appeared in person, entrusted their vote to another elector, or more often
sent an electoral embassy, even if they were present (as the king of Bohemia
in 1657 and 1690, or the elector of Mainz in 1741).&nbsp; The ministers
presented their credentials to the archbishop of Mainz, who presided over
the deliberations, in particular the drafting of the electoral capitulation.&nbsp;
When the moment to vote came, the Grand Marshal ordered all princes, noblemen,
ambassadors, representatives etc. not part of an electoral suite out of
the city. The electors proceeded on horseback from the city hall to the
cathedral, and convened in the electoral chapel, and swore to choose the
worthiest man, and to accept the majority vote.&nbsp; The elector of Mainz
proceeded to collect the votes, starting with Trier and ending with Saxony,
and then himself.&nbsp; Electors could vote for themselves, as the king
of Bohemia frequently did (although formally, a majority voted for him 
and he then consented).
</p>

<p>The candidate receiving more than half of the votes was elected.&nbsp;
In modern times the votes were unanimous.&nbsp; However, some elections
were contentious.  The election of 1519 was one.  As early as 1516, while
Maximilian was not clear about his own intentions for his successor, the
king of France Fran&ccedil;ois I had begun collecting votes, and by 1518 secured
the votes of Trier, Mainz, Brandenburg and the Palatinate.  Then
Maximilian decided to have his grandson Charles elected before his own
death, and soon had the commitment of Brandneburg, Cologne, Mainz and the
Palatinate, with the vote of Bohemia (the minor king Louis II) cast by his
guardians Maximilian and the king of Poland.  With Maximilian's death 
all bets were off and negotiations began anew.  Here, the order of 
voting mattered, and allowed electors to make conditional promises:
thus, Joachim of Brandenburg (who voted 6th) could promise to vote for 
Fran&ccedil;ois if two electors had voted for him and if he knew that his
brother the archbishop of Mainz (who voted last) would also vote for him.
In the end, Charles secured enough votes to win the election, in 
part through payments to the electors (330,000 florins in lump-sum
payments and a total of 30,000 florins in annual pensions promised
to four electors).  What happened on June 27 (when the voting began
and broke off after an hour) and June 28 is unclear; there is a 
possibility that Frederick the Wise of Saxony was elected but 
declined.  In the end, all electors voted for Charles, although
the elector of Brandenburg made a notarized statement beforehand
that his vote was not free.  (see Henry J. Cohn, 'Did Bribes 
Induce the German Electors to Choose Charles V as Emperor in 1519?'
<i>German History</i> 19(1):1-27.)
</p>

<p>Another contested election was that of 1741.  Karl VI had died in
1740, the last male Habsburg: there was no obvious successor for
the first time in over two hundred years.  In 1741 the electors
decided to exclude the ambassadors of Karl's daughter Maria Theresia, queen of Bohemia,
not because she was a woman but because of the pending dispute over that
crown (the elector of Bavaria had just seized Prague and had himself crowned
king of Bohemia in December 1741).&nbsp; She protested against the legality
of the election until the treaty of April 22, 1745 with Bavaria, by which
she posthumously recognized Karl VII as emperor.&nbsp; At the election
of 1745, she voted, but the electors Palatine and of Brandenburg abstained,
although the elector of Brandenburg later recognized the validity of the
election on Dec. 25, 1745.
</p><p>Once elected, the candidate was asked by the archbishop of Mainz if
he accepted the election capitulation drafted by the electors (until 1708,
the ambassadors of the king of Bohemia were shown the draft beforehand
in an adjacent room).&nbsp; If he did, he was immediately proclaimed in
the cathedral.&nbsp; In the elect's absence his ambassador or representative
took the oath, but the imperial government remained in the hands of the
vicars until the elect had taken the oath himself.
</p><p>The procedures for electing a king of the Romans were identical, except
that the king-elect swore not to intervene in the affairs of the Empire.
</p><p>The Golden Bull prescribed that the German coronation take place
in Aachen,
although in modern times it usually took place in the same city as the
election.&nbsp; According to an agreement of 16 June 1657, included in
the Wahlkapitulation of 1658, the ceremony was performed either by the
archbishop of Cologne or the archbishop of Mainz, according to whose
province was the location of the coronation (Frankfurt was in the
province of Mainz); and if it took place outside of either province
(for example, Regensburg, in the province of Salzburg) then Cologne and
Mainz alternated.<br>

</p><p>The insignia used in the coronation consisted of the crown, the silver
scepter, two rings, a gold orb, the sword of Charlemagne and the sword of
Saint Mauritius, various clothes, an illuminated Gospel, a sabre of Charlemagne,
and a number of relics (the tablecloth of the Last Supper, the cloth with
which Christ washed the feet of the Apostles, a thorn of his crown, a piece
of the Cross, the spear that pierced his side, a piece of his crib, the
arm of Saint Ann, a tooth of John the Baptist, the blood of Saint Stephen).&nbsp;
These insignia and relics were kept in Aachen and N&uuml;rnberg and sent
to the coronation.&nbsp; The emperor was crowned by either the archbishop
of Mainz or that of Trier, depending on the diocese in which the ceremony
took place (in 1742, the archbishop of Cologne, brother of Emperor Karl
VII, officiated with the consent of the archbishop of Mainz).&nbsp; All
three spiritual electors laid together the crown on the emperor's head.&nbsp;
After the election the emperor was made a canon of the cathedral of Aachen.&nbsp;
He then proceeded to the city hall for the banquet.

<h3>
C. The&nbsp;<a name="Princes"></a>Princes</h3>
The second college of the Reichstag was composed of the princes, counts,
lords and prelates who ranked as <i>states of the Empire</i> (<i>Reichsst&auml;nde</i>).
Not all were members of the college, or even directly represented. The
composition of the assembly varied before it was&nbsp; formally organized;
after 1489, however, no further increases were possible without a majority
vote, and the membership list was formally set in 1582. The Council did
not operate on a one-man one-vote principle. Accordingly, there were individual
votes (<i>Virilstimmen</i>) and collective votes (<i>Curiatstimmen</i>).
<p>The <b>Council of Princes</b> (<i>Reichsf&uuml;rstenrat</i>) included
both clerics and lay people.
</p><p><b>Clerics</b>, as in other European Estates such as the House of Lords
in England or the Estates General, had a seat by virtue of the see or abbacy.
Those prelates who did not have individual
votes were grouped into two benches, the Bench of the Rhine and the Bench
of Swabia, each with a collective vote.

</p><p>The <b>secular princes</b> included the <i>Princes</i> (<i>F&uuml;rsten</i>)
properly speaking (with titles of prince, grand-duke, duke, count palatine,
margrave, landgrave) and the <i>Counts and Lords</i> (<i>Grafen und Herren</i>).
The princes held individual votes (although sometimes held collectively
by a family)
while the counts and lords were grouped in Benches, each bench with one
collective
vote.&nbsp; The bench of Franconia was created in 1630-1641 from the
bench of Swabia, and the bench of Westphalia was created in 1653 with
part of the bench of Wetterau: thus, after 1653, there were four
benches.
</p><p>Until 1582, votes at the Reichstag were owned by individuals, and were
often multiplied when inheritances were divided, or, more often, jointly
held by several families. After 1582, votes were attached to a territory
(in a few exceptional cases a vote was granted to an individual without
territory), and were no longer multiplied, but could still be shared by
various individuals (as result of an inheritance, typically).

</p><p>By 1792, there were 100 votes in the Council of Princes, of which 55
were Catholic (although Osnabr&uuml;ck alternated between Catholic and
Protestant since the peace of Westphalia).  Of the 100 votes, 37 were clerics
(35 individual votes and 2 collective votes), while 63 were lay (59 individual
votes and 4 collective votes). (See the <a href="http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/reichsstande.htm#mozTocId131241">detailed
composition</a>.)
</p>

<p>
The peace of Lun&eacute;ville of 1801 led to the
elimination of 18 votes in territories ceded to France, almost all of them Catholic. 
Plans to redistribute votes floundered on the issue of maintaining the religious balance, 
and although a special committee of the Reichstag had reached and agreement in 1803,
the Emperor had not yet ratified it by the time the Empire dissolved in 1806 (see 
<a href="#Secularization">below</a>).

</p><h3>
<a name="Composition"></a>Secular votes in the Council of Princes, 1582</h3>

<p>
The following table (based on Arenberg 1951) lists the secular votes in the <i>Reichsf&uuml;rstenrat</i>
in 1582, the decisive moment when allocation of votes became determined
by strict rules. The families who possessed those votes in 1582 are considered
<i>Hochadel</i>:
<i>altf&uuml;rstlich</i>
for the princely families, <i>altgr&auml;flich</i> for the comital families.
Families who were elevated between 1582 and 1803 to princely (resp. comital)
rank, with membership in the Council of Princes, are termed <i>neuf&uuml;rstlich
</i>(resp.
<i>neugr&auml;flich</i>).

<a name="Evolution"></a>Evolution of the Council of Princes from 1582 to
1803</h3>
With the peace of Westphalia in 1648, 9 ecclesiastical territories were
secularized (the word was coined by the French delegation at the Westphalia
negotiations), and the corresponding votes transferred to the <i>Reichsf&uuml;rstenrat</i>,
in the hands of the families who possessed the corresponding temporal estates:
<ul>
<li>
Magdeburg, Halberstadt, Minden, Camin (to Brandenburg)</li>

<li>
Bremen, Verden (to Hanover)</li>

<li>
Schwerin (to Mecklemburg)</li>

<li>
Ratzenburg (to Mecklemburg-Strelitz)</li>

<li>
Hersfeld (to Hesse-Cassel).</li>
</ul>
From 1582 to 1803, only a small number of new princes were given <i>Reichsstand</i>
(that is, with a vote at the <i>Reichstag</i>):
<ul>
<li>
1641: Hohenzollern-Hechingen, Eggenberg (extinct 1717), Lobkowicz</li>

<li>
1654: Salm, Dietrichstein, Piccolomini, Nassau-Hadamar, Nassau-Dillenburg,
Auersperg</li>



<li>
1667: F&uuml;rstenberg</li>

<li>
1674: Schwarzenberg</li><li>
1677: Ostfriesland</li>


<li>
1713: Liechtenstein</li>

<li>
1754: Schwarzburg, Thurn-Taxis</li>
</ul>
A number of titles of prince were created for members of the counts' benches, 
but without ever receiving an
individual vote at the Reichstag: &Ouml;ttingen (14 Oct 1674), Waldeck
(17 Jul 1682), Nassau-Saarbrucken (4 Aug 1688), Nassau-Usingen (4 Aug 1688),
Nassau-Idstein (4 Aug 1688), Nassau-Weilburg (4 Aug 1688), Reu&szlig;-Greitz
(1778), Lippe-Detmold (1789), Reu&szlig;-Schleiz (1806), Schaumburg-Lippe
(1807). (Note that most of them became sovereign families after 1815).

<h3>
D. Imperial&nbsp;<a name="Cities"></a>Cities</h3>
The Imperial Cities (Reichsst&auml;dte) contained 51 cities, grouped in
the Bench of the Rhine (14 cities) and the Bench of Swabia (37 cities).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Their position in the Reichstag was not always clear; in particular, their
ability to cast decisive votes, which was nevertheless confirmed in 1648.
They had no say on certain matters: the admission of new States of the
Empire, the investiture of imperial fiefs (as long as they were not affected),
imperial wars (after 1803, when they gained the neutrality they had long
requested). The presiding city was the one in which the Reichstag was held,
which was always Regensburg after 1663.
<p>In 1803, 45 cities were mediatized, leaving 6 cities: Augsburg, L&uuml;beck,
N&uuml;rnberg, Frankfurt, Bremen, Hamburg. Augsburg and N&uuml;rnberg were
absorbed by Bavaria in 1806. Frankfurt became a grand-duchy in 1810 but
re-emerged with a minicipal government in 1813. Frankfurt was the seat
of the Bund's assembly from 1816 to 1866; it was annexed by Prussia in
that year. L&uuml;beck was annexed to Schleswig-Holstein under the Nazis
in 1937. At present, Bremen and Hamburg still exist as autonomous <i>L&auml;nder</i>
in the Federal Republic of Germany, the last remnants of the Imperial cities.


</p><h3><a name="Comp-all">E. Composition of the Reichstag in 1521, 1755, 1792</a></h3>


<p>
The composition of the Reichstag at these three dates is fairly
well known, because of three sources:
</p><ul>
<li>the <i>Reichsmatrikel</i> of 1521, drawn for fiscal purposes, was
the tax roll of the Empire
</li><li>a textbook on public law written by the jurist Christian August
von Beck c.1756 for the education of the future emperor Joseph II
</li><li>the publications in 1792 of the jurist Johann Stephan P&uuml;tter,
reprinted in several references
</li></ul>
<p>
For the <i>Handbuch der deutschen Geschichte</i>, Oestreich and Holzer
have collated these three lists and determined which members appeared
or disappeared between those dates, and why.  The lists are presented
in a <a href="/topics/royalty/reichsstande.htm">separate page</a> (in German).

</p><h2>
3. The&nbsp;<a name="Courts"></a>Courts of the Empire</h2>

<h3>
A. High Courts</h3>

<h3><a name="RKG"></a>Reichskammergericht</h3>

<p>
The <b>Reichskammergericht</b> (<i>Camerae Imperialis Judicium</i>), Imperial
Chamber Court, was created at the Worms Reichstag of 1495. Its initial
purpose was to sit in judgment of violations of the <i>Landfrieden</i>
of 1495, but over time became the main court of the Empire and the guarantor
of imperial law.
</p><p>The Court consisted initially of a Judge assisted by 16 assessors (a
number increased to 50 in 1648 and reduced to 25 in 1729). The Judge, two
Presidents and one assessor were appointed by the Emperor, the other assessors
by the electors and by the circles of the States of the Empire. The Judge
was noble, or rank no less than a baron. Half of the assessors were noblemen,
the others were doctors of law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Judge, one President and
13 assessors were catholics, the other President and 12 assessors were
protestants (Augsburg confession). The members, once appointed, were <i>reichsunmittelbar</i>
and could not be removed except by the Court&nbsp; itself. The court also
had 12 advocates and 30 procurators to process cases. Cases were examined
by "senates" of 8 or 9 members, with equal numbers of protestants and catholics.
When the senate was split evenly, additional members were appointed, or
the case was sent to the full Court. In religious matters, members voted
by religion (a procedure called <i>itio in partes</i>). If votes remained
evenly split, the matter was sent to the Reichstag. On some procedural
matters the Court could make interim rulings that had force of law until
an imperial law was published.
</p><p>The Court was competent in suits against immediate members of the empire,
either in first or second instance; in civil matters involving mediate
members of the empire, as appeals court from local courts (except when
there was <i>privilegium de non appellando</i>, as for territories of electors);
appeals on denials of justice; it could also confirm treaties, testaments,
guardianships among immediate members. It had no jurisdiction over spiritual
matters (including validity of marriages), cases involving major fiefs
or matters of imperial grace, criminal cases involving immediate members.
The court had exclusive jurisdiction over judicial matters involving its
own members.
</p><p>One could ask the Court to review its own rulings, or refer the matter
to a <i>Reichskammergerichtsvisitation</i>, a commission appointed by the
Reichstag to periodically review the Court's activities (initially annual,
these visitations became scarcer after the 16th c.). Ultimately, it was
always possible to appeal to the Reichstag itself.
</p>

<h3><a name="RHR"></a>Reichshofrath</h3>

<p>
Maximilian I had only reluctantly agreed to the formation of the Reichskammergericht.
To help him in his direct administration of justice, he established in
1518 a <b>Reichshofrath<i> </i></b>(<i>Consulium imperiale aulicum</i>),
Imperial Court or Aulic Council, which became accepted as equal to the Reichskammergericht
in 1648.
</p><p>Contrary to the Court, this body was a creature of the Emperor. It had
a president, a vice-president, and 16 councillors, all appointed by the
Emperor. The imperial vice-chancellor, appointed by the arch-chancellor
(the elector of Mainz) was also a member ex officio, and presided in the
absence of the president. (The vice-chancellor and the president were the
only Imperial Ministers). Members of the Council had to be German nationals,
and the president and vice-president had to be noblemen of the empire (prince,
count or baron). Members could not be removed except by a ruling of the
Council itself, but the death of the emperor automatically brought the
dissolution of the council and the imperial chancery.
</p><p>The Council had two functions:
</p><ol>
<li>
as Council of State, to which certain matters of state had to be referred
(the Emperor was free, however, to surround himself with other advisors
in ad-hoc councils, such as a war council or a secret council);</li>

<li>
as a high court whose jurisdiction overlapped with that of the Court.</li>
</ol>
The Council had essentially the same jurisdiction as the Court, and it
was up to the plaintiff to choose where to file his suit. There were other
matters in which only the Council was competent; and there were matters
where the Court's jurisdiction was acknowledged but which were routinely
handled by the Council. Such was the case of criminal cases involving immediate
members, and cases involving imperial favors or concessions.
<p>All matters were decided by the whole Council. In case of split votes,
the president could break the tie, or he could choose to refer the matter
to the Emperor. In religious matters, an even split automatically referred
the matter to the Reichstag. Appeals were handled the same way as for the
Court, except that the right of visitations, in principle held by the arch-chancellor
(elector of Mainz) were never exercised.
</p><h3>
B. Lower Courts</h3>
&nbsp;
<h2>
4.&nbsp;<a name="Structure"></a>Structure of the Empire</h2>
The Empire was made up of sub-units, either territories or people. They
can be classified according to several related but distinct dichotomies:
<ul>
<li>
allodial and feudal</li>

<li>
states of the Empire and non-states</li>

<li>
immediate and mediate lands or people</li>

<li>
sovereign and subject</li>

<li>
temporal (secular) and spiritual (ecclesiastic)</li>

<li>
etc.</li>
</ul>
These distinctions will be explained below and their relationships explored.
<h3>
A.&nbsp;<a name="Geographical"></a>Geographical Structure</h3>

<h3>
<a name="external"></a>External Boundaries</h3>

<P>
The external boundaries of the Empire varied over time. In particular,
the western boundary shifted many times eastward, as French kings encroached
on the Empire as they enlarged their domains. Thus Provence (1246), Dauphin&eacute;
(1349), the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, Verdun (1558), Alsace (1648), Franche-Comt&eacute;
(1678), Lorraine (1736), the west bank of the Rhine (1801) were incorporated
into France, losses that were eventually acknowledged by the Emperors. There were losses elsewhere:
the Swiss cantons, practically independent of their Habsburg overlords
since the Middle Ages, were formally set free at the Peace of Westphalia
in 1648.
<p>The Empire itself consisted of Imperial lands (<i>Reichsl&auml;nder</i>)
properly speaking, and neighbouring lands. The latter category included
Lorraine, Burgundy, and Lombardy. Bohemia was part of the Imperial lands
because its king was an elector, but its status as a kingdom was unique
within the empire. When the elector of Brandenburg became king of Prussia,
he was so only in his lands lying outside of the Empire.
</P>
<P>
The exact status of Northern Italy within the Empire became rather confused
over time.  By the 18th century, what remained formally were a collection
of imperial fiefs of various sizes: 13 in Lombardy (including the duchies
of Milan, Mantua, Monferrat, the principality of Mirandola, the Gonzaga
territories), 19 in Liguria, 20 in the region of Bologna (including the duchies
of Modena and Ferrara), 10 in Tuscany (the grand-duchy of Tuscany, Piombino, Soramo,
Comacchio) and 11 in Tirnisani.

The territorial components of the Empire fell into one of the following
categories:
<ul>
<li>
principalities (<i>F&uuml;rstent&uuml;mer, principatus</i> in Latin), subdivided
into</li>

<ul>
<li>
electorates,</li>

<li>
duchies,</li>

<li>
principalities,</li>

<li>
palatine counties, margraviats, landgraviats, princely counties (<i>gef&uuml;rstete
Grafschaften</i>)</li>
</ul>

<li>
imperial counties (<i>Reichsgrafschaften</i>)</li>

<li>
free lordships (<i>freie Herrschaften, dominia</i>)</li>

<li>
ecclesiastical territories (<i>praelaturae</i>)</li>

<li>
free imperial cities (<i>Reichsst&auml;dte</i>)</li>

<li>
free imperial villages (<i>Reichsd&ouml;rfer, pagi imperii</i>)</li>
</ul>
Independently of the above classification, territories can also be classified
into <i>feudal</i> and <i>allodial</i>. A feudal territory was held from
the Emperor as a fief, that is, by virtue of a certain type of contract.
In exchange for enjoyment of the territory, the vassal owed certain duties,
and was subject to certain restrictions and oversight of the Emperor. An
allodial territory was a territory for which no feudal contract existed.
It was subject to the emperor as sovereign but not to the emperor as overlord.
A territory was presumed to be allodial unless shown otherwise. The term
"free", also applied to certain counties, indicated that the territory
was allodial. Major ecclesiastical territories were typically allodial.
<p>Under Maximilian I the imperial states had been organized in Imperial
Circles (<i>Reichskreise</i>). The original 6 Circles of 1500 (Swabia,
Bavaria, Franconia, upper Saxony, lower Saxony, Westphalia)&nbsp; were
increased in 1512 to 10 (Austria, Rhine, Saxony, Burgundy). The role of
the circles was to serve as administrative units in the enforcement of
imperial law and order. Each was headed by a prince as <i>Kreisoberst</i>,
and regional assemblies called <i>Kreistage</i> were held (which could
include territories that were not imperial states).

<h4> Other Territories of the Empire</h4>

<P>
The Circles did not include all territories of the Empire: notably, Bohemia
(pop: 2.9m, area 982 sq mi), Moravia (<i>M&auml;hren</i>; pop: 1.2m, 468
sq mi), Lusatia (0.45m, 180 sq mi) and a number of others totalling 0.25m
and 200 sq mi.
<h3>
B.&nbsp;<a name="Political"></a>Political Structure</h3>

<h4>
<a name="Sovereignty"></a>Sovereignty</h4>
The motley and variable collection of powers and rights held by rulers
of territories within the Empire were collectively known as <i>sovereignty</i>
(<i>Landeshoheit, Landesherrlichkeit, Landesobrigkeit</i>, <i>Landesf&uuml;rstlichkeit</i>,
<i>jus
territoriale</i>). This covered a number of substantially different rights:
<ul>
<li>
regalian rights, held from the Emperor, such as the right to dispense justice,
collect taxes and tolls, mint coins, exploit mines, etc</li>

<li>
right of enfeoffment: the ability to have knights in one's service and
call them to war</li>

<li>
seigniorial rights and feudal rights.</li>
</ul>
These rights were possessed to varying degrees, and there were disputes
over who was sovereign and who wasn't. Definitive signs of sovereignty
were the right to collect taxes, the receipt of homage from the inhabitants,
the existence of local estates representing knights, prelates and cities;
and above all jurisdiction in first instance and appeal in civil cases.
Curiously, jurisdiction over criminal cases, and even the ability to impose
death sentences (<i>Blutbann</i>) was not in of itself a sign of sovereignty.
Jurisdiction included not just the ability to rule in particular cases,
but also the ability to publish general rules, in other words legislate.
The legislative ability was somewhat constrained by the overall framework
of imperial legislation which it could not contradict, but the latter served
mainly to complement the local legislation.
<p>Sovereignty was considered to be bestowed by the Emperor, and its possession
to result from an investiture by the Emperor. This was true of imperial
fiefs, which were themselves granted by investiture, but also of allodial
lands. The right to receive the investiture was nevertheless attached to
the land, and could not be denied by the Emperor.
</p><p>Sovereignty was exercised: by hereditary lords, by elected prelates,
by municipal governments. It could pass by inheritance, testament, investiture,
infeoffment, or even sale or lien. Its possession or enjoyment did not
require noble status. It could be owned jointly in condominium.
</p><h4>
<a name="immediate"></a>Immediate and Mediate Status</h4>
Whether or not an individual, an institution or an area was directly subject to the emperor's
authority defined the status of "immediate" and "mediate" subject of the
Empire (<i>reichsunmittelbar, reichsmittelbar</i>).&nbsp; This distinction
has nothing to do with being noble or commoner: for example, a number of
high officials in the imperial courts and the chancery were immediate,
whether noble or not.&nbsp; The status of immediate subject was also distinct
from that of state of the Empire: there were many immediate territories
that were not states of the Empire, and there could be states that were
not immediate.  Examples of tiny immediate territories include the 
villages of Goschheim and Seenfald near Schweinfurt, the four villages
of Kahldorf, Petersbach, Biburg, and Wangen, some farms in Upper Swabia, etc.
The status of immediate subject of the emperor could be held by an
institution, such as the Schoppenstuhl in Aachen.
<h4>
<a name="Knights"></a>Knights of the Empire</h4>
The Knights of the Empire (<i>Reichsrittern</i>) were nobles whose direct
overlord was the Emperor, remnants of the medieval
<i>Edelfrei</i> and
<i>Ministerialen</i>
who never achieved status of upper nobility. To protect their rights, they
organized themselves into three unions (<i>Partheien) </i>in the late 15th
century and into a single <i>Corpus</i> in 1577, and fought hard to win
recognition. Their immediate status was recognized at the Peace of Westphalia.
They never gained access to the Reichstag, and were not considered <i>Hochadel</i>.&nbsp;
In 1650 they organized themselves into three circles, subdivided into cantons:
<ul>
<li>
Swabian Circle: 668 territories, pop: 0.16m, 70 sq mi (cantons: an der
Donau; im Hegau, Algau &amp; am Bodensee; am Neckar, am Schwarzwald &amp;
and der Ortenau; am Kocher; im Craichgau)</li>

<li>
Franconian Circle: 702 territories, pop: 0.2m, 80 sq mi (cantons: Odenwald;
Geb&uuml;rg; R&ouml;hn-Werra; am Steigerwald; an der Altm&uuml;hl; an der
Baunach)</li>

<li>
Rhenish Circle: 0.09m, 40 sq mi (cantons: Oberrheinstrom; Mittelrhein-
&amp; Unterrheinstrom)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
5. The&nbsp;<a name="End"></a>End of the Empire (1803-06)</h2>

<h3>
A. The&nbsp;<a name="Secularization"></a>Secularization of 1803</h3>The
French Revolution and the European war that broke out as a result in
1792 ultimately led to the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire and the
redrawing of the map of Europe. As a result of French victories in
1794-95,
French troops occupied the whole Left Bank of the Rhine, including the
Circle of Burgundy and other territories. These losses, ratified by the
treaty of Campoformio on 17 Oct 1797, were supposed to lead to
compensations
within the Empire for the dispossessed families. The congress at
Rastadt
had begun work on this compensation, on the basis of secularization of
almost all ecclesiastical Reichsst&auml;nde (the only survivors were
the
archbishop of Mainz, the knights of St. John and the Teutonic Knights).
War broke out again from 1798 to 1800, but the Treaty of
Lun&eacute;ville
in 1801 confirmed the loss of the left bank of the Rhine; it also
spelled out the principle that territorial losses by members of the
German empire should be compensated within the Empire out of the
secularized states.<br>
<br>
An imperial delegation
(<i>Reichsdeputation</i>) representing the Reichstag was sent to Paris
to negotiate with Bonaparte the conditions under which this secularization
would take place. Their main resolution, the famous <a href="http://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/rechtsphilosophie/hdoc/reichsdeputationshauptschluss1803.html" target="new"><i>Reichsdeputationshauptschlu&szlig;</i>
of 25 Feb 1803</a>,
was ratified by the Reichstag on 24 March 1803 and
by the Emperor on 27 April 1803, with a reservation concerning the new
allocation of votes in the Reichstag. The new number of votes was 131,
but with an overwhelming Protestant majority which the Emperor did not
accept. The new distribution of votes thus never took legal effect, but
mediatization and land reallocation did.&nbsp; Although this new
arrangement barely
lasted at all, it had important consequences because the situation in
which
families stood as of 1806 determined their subsequent status within
Germany
after 1815 (more on this later).
<p>The new distribution increased the number of votes from 100 (35
spiritual princes, 2 prelates' benches, 59 temporal princes, 4 counts'
benches) to 131. <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>-2: all members of the two prelates' benches of Swabia and the Rhine were allocated to various princes and counts. <br>
  </li>
  <li>-7: of the temporal princes, 7 seats were eliminated. <br>
  </li>
  <li>-11: of the 35 existing spiritual states, 3 survived (archduke of
Austria, the Teutonic Order and the Order of St. John), 11 were
formally eliminated (annexed by France) and the rest secularized and
transferred to existing (18) or new (3) princes.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>+51: To maintain a balance in the council of princes, a number of
new votes were
created as well, either in favor of existing members (31), or to
introduce new
members (20). Some new members had already been made titular princes
but without votes
(Nassau-Usingen, Nassau-Weilburg, Waldeck, &Ouml;ttingen,
Reu&szlig;-Plauen-Greitz), others numbered among the counts; four new
members were not previously members of the Reichstag either as princes
or counts:&nbsp; the former grand-duke of Tuscany, the former duke of
Modena, Ligne and Looz.</li>

<h2>
The&nbsp;<a name="dissolution"></a>dissolution of 1806 and mediatization</h2>

<p>The Empire, which had become a loose confederation of virtually
sovereign
states in 1648, was close to collapse after the major territorial
changes
wrought by France. Napoleon, whose ambitions found Russia, Prussia and
Austria arrayed against him, tried to create a coalition of German
states
free from the influence of either Prussia or Austria. More generally,
he was trying to achieve a longstanding goal of French policy: to
establish her dominance over Germany.&nbsp; Napoleon succeeded in
making
allies of Baden and W&uuml;rttemberg, and keeping Prussia neutral, in
the
war of September-December 1805 which ended with the crushing victory of
Austerlitz (Dec 2). The resulting peace treaty of Pressburg (Dec 26)
enlarged Napoleon's
allies and made them kings, while Austria lost all
remaining possessions in Italy. <br>
</p>
<p>These results decided a number of German
states to abandon the Empire and form a new Confederation under Napoleon's
protection. This was the <b><a href="/topics/royalty/germany19.htm#rheinbund">Confederation
of the Rhine</a></b> (<i>Rheinbund</i>), formed 12 July 1806 and initially
composed of ten members, enlarged by 1808 to thirty and made up of almost
all German states, the exceptions being Austria and Prussia.
</p>
<p>The treaty of 12 July 1806 obligated its members to announce their separation
from the Empire by Aug 1 (art. 3). Accordingly, on that date, the members
of the Confederation published a note declaring that, in their view, the
Empire had ceased to exist. Here is an excerpt of the text (see <a href="http://www.documentarchiv.de/nzjh/1806/reichsaustritt-rheinbundstaaten.html">the
full text</a>):
</p><blockquote>&laquo; Die Begebenheiten der drei letzten Kriege, und die
Politischen Ver&auml;nderungen, welche daraus ensprungen sind, haben die
traurige Wahrheit in das hellste Licht gesetzt, dass das Band, welches,
bisher die verschiedenen Glieder des teutschen Staatsk&ouml;rpers miteinander
vereinigen sollte, f&uuml;r diesen Zweck nicht mehr hinreiche oder vielmehr,
dass es in der Tat schon aufgel&ouml;st sei...
<br>Nur diesem Umstande muss man ohne Zweifel die im Jahre 1795 im Reiche
selbst hervorgetane Trennung zuschreiben, die eine Absonderung des Interesses
des n&ouml;rdlichen und des s&uuml;dlichen Deutschlands zur Folge hatte...
Die Frankreich zun&auml;chst gelegenen, von allem Schutz entbl&ouml;ssten
und allen Drangsalen eines Krieges, dessen Beendigung in den verfassungsm&auml;ssigen
Mitteln zu suchen nicht in ihrer Gewalt stand, ausgesetzten F&uuml;rsten
sahen sich gezwungen sich durch Separatfrieden von dem allgemeinen Verbande
in der That zu trennen... Indem sie sich durch gegenw&auml;rtige Erkl&auml;rung
von ihrer bisherigen Verbindung mit dem teutschen Reichsk&ouml;rper lossagen,
befolgen sie bloss das durch fr&uuml;here Vorg&auml;nge und selbst durch
Erkl&auml;rungen der m&auml;chtigeren Reichst&auml;nde aufgestellte System...
Dass die kostbare Ruhe der Hauptzweck des rheinischen Bundes sei, davon
fanden die bisherigen Reichsmitst&auml;nde der Souver&auml;ns, in deren&nbsp;
Namen die gegenw&auml;rtige Erkl&auml;rung geschieht, den deutlichen Beweis
darin, dass jeder unter ihnen, dessen Lage ihm eine Theilnahme daran erw&uuml;nschlich
machen kann, der Beitritt zu demselben offen gelassen ist &raquo;

On the same day, the French ambassador to the Reichstag issued a note stating
that "S.M. L'Empereur et Roi est donc oblig&eacute; de d&eacute;clarer
qu'il ne reconna&icirc;t plus l'existence de la constitution germanique,
en reconnaissant n&eacute;anmoins la souverainet&eacute; enti&egrave;re
et absolue de chacun des princes dont les &eacute;tats composent aujourd'hui
l'Allemagne et en conservant avec eux les m&ecirc;mes relations qu'avec
les autres puissances ind&eacute;pendantes de l'Europe" (HM the Emperor
and King is thus forced to declare that he does not recognize anymore the
existence of the German state, but nevertheless recognizes the complete
and absolute sovereignty of each of the princes whose states presently
compose Germany, and maintaining with them the same relations as with the
other independent powers of Europe).
<h3>
<a name="1806abd"></a>abdication of Francis II (1806)</h3>As early as
May 1806, the Austrian minister of foreign affairs Friedrich von
Stadion had asked two advisers (his brother Lothar von Station and
Alois von H&uuml;gel) their opinions on the advisability of the
Emperor's abdication.&nbsp; The memos were finished on May 17 and
presented to the Emperor on June 17.&nbsp; Both advisers were of the
opinion that, while the Empire could in principle survive the peace of
Pressburg, in reality it was Napoleon's intent to use his German allies
and destroy the Empire or subjugate it, and that the Emperor would
ultimately fail to prevent this; the time would soon come when the
advantages of the German imperial crown would outweigh its
benefits.&nbsp; Stadion endorsed the reports, and the Emperor
essentially agreed that at some point, it would be time to abdicate the
crown.<br>
<br>
The time came soon: on July 22, Napoleon gave Austrian diplomats an
ultimatum: either the German Emperor abdicated by August 10 or else war
would resume.&nbsp; Francis II drew the logical conclusions, and on
August 6, the Austrian chancery in Vienna published the following
declaration (see <a href="/topics/royalty/hre-abd.htm">translations
in French and English</a>):

<p>&laquo; Wir, Franz der Zweite, von Gottes Gnaden erw&auml;hlter r&ouml;mischer
Kaiser, zu allen Zeiten Mehrer des Reichs, Erbkaiser von Osterreich, etc,
K&amp;ounml;nig in Germanien, zu Hungarn, B&ouml;heim, Croatien, Dalmazien,
Slavonien, Galizien, Lodomerien und Jerusalem, Erzherzog zu Oesterreich,
etc.
</p><p>Nach dem Abschlusse des Presburger Friedens war Unsere ganze Aufmerksamkeit
und Sorgfalt dahin gerichtet, allen Verpflichtungen, die Wir dadurch eingegangen
hatten, mit gewohnter Treue und Gewissenhaftigkeit das vollkommenste Gen&uuml;ge
zu leisten, und die Segnungen des Friedens Unsern V&ouml;lkern zu erhalten,
die gl&uuml;cklich wieder hergestellten friedlichen Verh&auml;ltnisse allenthalben
zu bestetigen, und zuerwarten, ob die durch diesen Frieden herbeigef&uuml;hretn
wesentlichen Ver&auml;nderungen im deutschen Reiche es Uns ferner m&ouml;glich
machen w&uuml;rden, den nach der kaiserlichen Wahlcapitulation Uns als
Reichs-Oberhaupt obliegenden schweren Pflichten genug zu thun. Die Folgerungen,
welche mehreren Artikeln des Presburger Friedens gleich nach dessen Bekanntwerdung
und bis jetzt gegeben worden, und die allgemein bekannten Ereignisse, welche
darauf im deutschen Reiche Statt hatten, haben Uns aber die Ueberzeugung
gew&auml;hrt, da&szlig; es unter den eingtretenen Umst&auml;nden unm&ouml;glich
seyn werde, die durch den Wahlvertrag eingegangenen Verpflichtungen ferner
zu erf&uuml;llen: und wenn noch der Fall &uuml;brig blieb, da&szlig; sich
nach f&ouml;rdersamer Beseitigung eingetretener politischer Verwickelungen
ein ver&auml;nderter Stand ergeben d&uuml;rfte, so hat gleichwohl die am
12. julius zu Paris unterzeichnete, und seitdem von den betreffenden Theilen
begnehmigte, Uebereinkunft mehrerer vorz&uuml;glichen St&auml;nde zu ihrer
g&auml;nzlichen Trennung von dem Reiche und ihrer Vereinigung zu einer
besondern Conf&ouml;deration, die gehegte Earwartung vollends vernichtet.
</p><p>Bei der hierdurch vollendeten Ueberzeugung von der g&auml;nzlichen Unm&ouml;glichkeit,
die Pflichten Unseres kaiserlichen Amtes l&auml;nger zu erf&uuml;llen,
sind Wir es Unsern Grunds&auml;tzen und Unserer W&uuml;rde schuldig, auf
eine Krone zu verzichten, welche nur so lange Werth in Unsern Augen haben
konnte, als Wir dem von Churf&uuml;rsten, F&uuml;rsten und St&auml;nden
und &uuml;brigen Angeh&ouml;rigen des deutschen Reichs Uns bezeigten Zutrauen
su entsprechen und den &uuml;bernommenen Obliegenheiten ein Gen&uuml;ge
zu leisten im Stande waren.
</p><p>Wir erkl&auml;ren demnach durch Gegenw&auml;rtiges dass wir das Band,
welches uns bis jetzt an den Staatsk&ouml;rper des deutschen Reichs gebunden
hat, als gel&ouml;st ansehen, dass wir das reichsoberhauptliche Amt und
W&uuml;rde durch die Vereinigung der conf&ouml;derierten rheinischen St&auml;nde
als erloschen und uns dadurch von allen &uuml;bernommenen Pflichten gegen
das Deutsche Reich losgezahlt betrachten und die von wegen desselben 'bis
jetzt getragene Kaiserkrone und gef&uuml;hrte Kaiserliche Regierung, wie
hiermit geschieht, niederlegen.
</p><p>Wir entbinden zugleich Kurf&uuml;rsten, F&uuml;rsten und St&auml;nde
und alle Reichsangeh&ouml;rigen, insonderheit auch die Mitglieder der h&ouml;chsten
Reichsgerichte und &uuml;brige Reichsdienerschaft von ihren Pflichten,
womit sie an uns, als das gesetzliche Oberhaupt des Reichs, durch die Konstitution
gebunden waren. Unsere s&auml;mmtlichen (sie) teutschen Provinzen und Reichsl&auml;nder
z&auml;hlen wir dagegen wechselseitig von allen Verpflichtungen, die sie
bis jetzt unter was einen Titel gegen das teutsche Reich getragen haben,
los, und wir werden selbige in ihrer Vereinigung mit dem ganzen &ouml;sterreichischen
Staatsk&ouml;rper, als Kaiser von Oesterreich unter den wiederhergestellten
und bestehenden friedlichen Verh&auml;ltnissen mit allen M&auml;chten und
benachbarten Staaten zu jener Stufe des Gl&uuml;cks und Wohlstandes zu
bringen beflissen sein, welche das Ziel aller unserer W&uuml;nsche, der
Zweck unserer angelegensten Sorgfalt stets sein wird.

</font></p></blockquote>The declaration did more than simply abdicate
the crown.&nbsp; Francis II also dissolved the Holy Roman Empire by
freeing
all his former subjects from its laws.&nbsp; While it was certainly in
his power to abdicate (Charles V had done so), it is difficult to argue
that he had the power to unilaterally dissolve the Empire.&nbsp; His
declaration was not communicated to the Reichstag by the normal
procedure (the so-called <i>Diktatur</i>)
but instead simply circulated to the other envoys at Regensburg by the
Austrian envoy (who was under instruction not to accept any
response).&nbsp; The Reichstag itself was in recess for three months
from July 7.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
German jurists of the 18th c. had elaborated a theory that the Emperor
could use emergency powers with the consent of the Reichstag, or at
least the consent of the Electors (more controversially, some asserted
that he could do so without any consent) in order to fulfill his
obligation to preserve the Empire.&nbsp; The advisers of Francis II
made the argument that it was not enough to abdicate: Napoleon could
have used an interregnum to wreak further damage or even have himself
installed as emperor, and it was in the members' best interests to
deprive Napoleon of such tools.&nbsp; But it seems difficult to argue
that the Emperor was legally founded to use his emergency powers to
destroy the Empire in order to save it.<br>
<br>
The legality of the dissolution could be founded on the tacit consent
of the members of the Empire; but there was at least one dissent,
namely the Elector of Hanover (king George III of Great Britain).&nbsp;
The text of the protest is not known, but its existence was asserted by
the Hanoverian envoy to the Vienna Congress in two declarations of Sep
1, 1813 and Nov 25, 1814 (Ompteda, <i>Politischer Nachla&szlig;</i>,
2:3:232 and Kl&uuml;ber 1:1:83 for the texts).&nbsp; The Elector of
Hanover continued to style himself as such until October 12, 1814.<br>
<br>
All other parties accepted the dissolution of the Empire.&nbsp;
Obviously, the signatories of the August 1 declaration did.&nbsp;
Denmark recognized the dissolution and annxed Holstein on Sept. 9,
1806; Sweden (which possessed Pomerania) did the same on Aug 22.&nbsp;
Prussia recognized the Confederation of the Rhine by the treaty of
Tilsit of Jul 9, 1807, and Austria by the treaty of Oct 14, 1809.&nbsp;
Only Great Britain never recognized the Confederation, and by 1813-14
continued to negate the dissolution of the Empire, and even (briefly)
argue for its restoration.<br>

It wasn’t until I started raising funds for victims of police brutality that I began being attacked for it. That these lies continue to spread in spite of the reality that we have been more transparent than nearly any charity or fundraiser in this space, is disgusting.

I will proudly continue to serve as the Senior Justice Writer for the New York Daily News. I will proudly continue to help families affected by police brutality in whatever way I can.

                <h2>Robert William Hughes, Cae'r Mynydd</h2>
                <p><img src="images/caer-nant.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="right" alt="Cae'r Nant" />In 1812, estate officers, lawyers and surveyors came to Llithfaen
                  to survey the common land. There were numerous one-night houses
                  (tai unnos) and many squatters inhabited the mountain as they
                  had always done. One such house was Cae'r Mynydd. With the
                  enclosure of common land, only those who had lived on these
                  lands for twenty years or more were allowed to retain their
                  property.</p>
                <p>Robert William Hughes of Cae'r Mynydd used a
                  large sea-shell to convene the residents of Llithfaen calling
                  upon
                    them to resist the officers and surveyors in September 1812.
                    The residents congregated on the mountain and showered the
                    officers with stones. A few days later, the Dragoons arrived
                    at Llithfaen and some of the rioters were caught and imprisoned
                    for six months. But on that occasion too, the sea-shell was
                    put to good use, and most of the rioters succeeded in fleeing
                    to the mountain to hide from the horsemen.</p>
                <p>The authorities
                  came to consider Robert Hughes, the shell man, as 'Captain
                  of the mob'. The Dragoons returned
                    to Llithfaen in March 1813, but yet again, found all the
                    houses deserted. The soldiers returned at night, and according
                    to folklore, they caught Robert Hughes at Cae'r Mynydd, hiding
                    in a bread rack which hung from a ceiling rafter. Numerous
                    skirmishes occurred as the horsemen caught other rioters
                    and took them to Caernarfon gaol. They avoided the path over
                    the Eifl and through Llanaelhaearn - and opted for
                    the far safer lowlands skirting Pwllheli and Tremadog.</p>
                <p>'
                    The king against Robert William Hughes, for a Riot' was
                    the charge put in court. Some of the rioters were fined and
                    imprisoned - a number of women amongst them - but Robert
                    Hughes and another called David Rowlands were sentenced to
                    death by hanging. Eventually they were 'pardoned' - Robert
                    Hughes was transported to Australia in 1813 to spend the
                  remainder of his life in Botany Bay.</p>
                <h2><img src="images/yr-eifl.jpg" width="400" height="533" class="right" alt="Yr Eifl" />Y Wal Fawr</h2>
                <h3>(lit. 'The Tall Wall'; the boundary
                  between enclosed fields and the mountain common land)</h3>
                <p>This mountain wall was built circa 1815 by unemployed soldiers
                  who had returned from the battle of Waterloo. The grid-like
                  fields, marked out by surveyors, date from the same period
                  - this was the land that was stolen from the people by the
                  Eifl Common Lands Enclosure Act.</p>
                <p align="center"><em>The working man is gaoled and fined<br />
                For stealing geese from common land;<br />
                But he who steals the land from geese<br />
                Is well respected, fine and grand.</em></p>
                <p>At the end of the 18th century in particular, efforts to gain
                  possession of the highlands and enclose them began in earnest.
                  This entailed the enclosure of approximately a quarter of Wales's
                  land - common lands which until that time ordinary folk
                  had been free to use as pasture and a source of peat. This
                  concerted campaign lasted well into the last half of the 19th
                  century, transforming not only the living conditions of ordinary
                  people but also the economy and landscape of rural areas in
                  general. It is estimated that in excess of a million acres
                  of Welsh land were enclosed during this period, about one fifth
                  of the whole country.</p>
                <h2>Tafarn y Fic</h2>
                <p>The public house was built in 1869 and originally consisted
                  of four small rooms. Doctor Jac, the local general practitioner,
                  held his surgery in one of the back rooms. Another back room
                  was set aside for the 'Paddies' who came up from Nant Gwrtheyrn.</p>
                <p>In
                  1988, a number of people formed a co-operative and raised money
                  to purchase the public house, which by that time had
                    been closed by the brewery. It became an important community
                    venue in Llyn and its evenings of Welsh language entertainment
                    became renowned throughout the area. Additional funding was
                    attracted to the venture and the building was modernized
                    and extended in 2004. The Fic re-opened its doors, and a
                    new era began with performances by some of Wales's
                    most prominent artists and also evenings of local homespun
                    entertainment called Lol Botas.</p>
                <h2><img src="images/llithfaen.jpg" width="400" height="301" class="right" alt="Llithfaen" />Carnguwch Church</h2>
                <p>The history of the church dates back to the
                  seventh century and it is consecrated to Saint Beuno, the patron
                  saint of
                    Clynnog, Penmorfa, Aberffraw, Trefdraeth, Llanycil, Gwyddelwern,
                    Beriw and Betws (Maldwyn) and Llanfenno in Herefordshire.
                His feast day is the 21st of April.</p>
                <p>The parish name (and the
                  mountain's) is a bit of a
                    mystery. Some venture that Cuwch was a Saint (there is a
                    Llangiwch yn Swansea) and it was not unusual to have two
                saints within the same parish.</p>
                <p>Carnguwch chapel came under
                  the auspices of the mother church at Clynnog, and it served
                  as a church to this parish. Some
                    of the features of the present building are its robust stonework,
                    the square bell tower and the ancient form of Lectern and
                    Pulpit - one beneath the other. It has a square seating
                area for the Llwyd family of Trallwyn.</p>
                <p>The church stands in
                    a peaceful rural location above a steep slope which runs
                    down to the banks of the river Erch. The
                    Curate at Pistyll held a Sunday afternoon service here until
                    1882 and by that time, St James's Church at Llithfaen had
                    been built to serve the new population that had grown in
                the village.</p>
                <p>The church was deconsecrated, but people were
                  still buried in the churchyard until the 1970s. At the end
                  of the twentieth
                    century, an association called the Friends of Carnguwch Church
                    was formed in order to conserve the building. The churchyard
                    wall was rebuilt, voluntary work carried out to the roof,
                    the tower, and the windows and the interior was repainted.
                    The Friends held a service at the church in June 2008 which
                was attended by more than one hundred people.</p>
                <h2><img src="images/nant-gwrtheyrn.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="right" alt="Nant Gwrtheyrn" />The Eifl Quarries
                (on the Llithfaen side)</h2>
                <p>There were three granite quarries on
                  the western side of the Eifl and the quarrymen of Llithfaen
                  and Nant Gwrtheyrn
                    worked at these sites. Chwarel y Nant, Chwarel Cae'r
                Nant, Chwarel Carreg y Llam.</p>
                <p>Chwarel Carreg y Llam was opened
                    in 1908 and it was the last to close - in November
                    1963. The same company owned Chwarel y Nant near Nant Gwrtheyrn - in
                    the early years, that quarry had its own boats, each one's
                    name comprising
                    the element 'maen' meaning 'stone': Calchfaen, Gwynfaen,
                    Torfaen, Llysfaen and Sylfaen. Sylfaen once carried explosives
                to the war in the Transvaal.</p>
                <p>Chwarel y Nant specialized in
                    making sets which were exported to pave the streets and pavements
                    of English cities. The
                    stones would be tipped down the chutes from the wagons. The
                    quarrymen called these wagons 'Pharo's Chariots' because
                they were so heavy to push.</p>
                <p>Each quarry gallery had its own
                    name and here are some of the names used for the galleries
                    at Chwarel y Nant: Ponc
                    Uchaf (Top Gallery), Bach (Small), Isaf (Lowest), Sir F&ocirc;n
                    (Anglesey), Buenos Aires, Palestina and Clogwyn Nefyn (Nefyn
                    Cliff). The village of Nant Gwrtheyrn was built in the wake
                    of the industry at the Nant in the 1860s. The two terraces
                    were called Sea View and Mountain View with Bay View on the
                    corner, opposite Seilo Chapel (built in 1878). Next to Bay
                    View, was the Co-op Shop and behind it, the bakehouse. The
                    Plas (mansion house) was the luxurious home of the quarry
                manager.</p>
                <p>At the end of the second World War, two trucks - eight
                    wheel vehicles which could travel by land and by sea - ran
                    between Chwarel y Nant and Carreg y Llam to transport materials
                from the Nant when the quarry was closed.</p>
                <h2><img src="images/trer-ceiri.jpg" width="400" height="532" class="right" alt="Tre'r Ceiri" />Llithfaen Chapel and
                Choir</h2>
                <p>As Llithfaen stands on the old main road from Arfon to
                  Ll&#375;n, it was to this village that the first Methodist preachers
                  came.
                  According to tradition, the first preaching service was held
                  at Cae Grug, beside the spot where Moriah Chapel was later
                  built. It was a summer's day and a cart was used as a
                pulpit.</p>
                <p>The first place of worship was a small farmhouse called
                  Abergafren and the first chapel was built in around 1780 where
                  the Ganolfan
                  (the community centre at the old school) now stands. The chapel
                had a thatched roof and an earth floor.</p>
                <p>The second chapel was
                  built on the farmland of Llithfaen Fawr, (1804) - on
                  the opposite side of the hedge to where the present chapel
                  stands. There too, the third chapel was built
                  in 1834, and the Day School also used that building. In 1841,
                  the population of Pistyll parish stood at 514 and the population
                of Carnguwch at 119.</p>
                <p>The fourth chapel was built in 1870, on
                  the site of the present building - it was one of the largest
                  examples of a chapel without
                  a gallery in Llyn and Eifionydd. In twenty years time, that
                  chapel also proved too small and the foyer and the chapel itself
                had to be knocked through to create more seating space.</p>
                <p>By the
                  beginning of the twentieth century, the chapel either had to
                  be repaired or rebuilt. A decision was made to build
                  a new chapel and add a vestry. Evan Roberts 'the Revivalist' held
                  the first religious service in the new chapel on 12th December,
                  1905. By 1901, the population of the two parishes was as follows:
                Pistyll-739, Carnguwch-112.</p>
                <p>The chapel's most striking
                  feature is its curved gallery for the choir behind the Deacon's
                  Seat and the pulpit - it
                  is unique in Wales and the reason why the building is listed
                  for conservation purposes. The choir gallery is a reflection
                  of the notable choral tradition in the Llithfaen area - it
                  once boasted exceptional male voice, mixed and children's choirs.
                  This culture reached its peak when Llithfaen Male Voice Choir
                  won first prize at the Pwllheli National Eisteddfod in 1925
                and again at Mountain Ash in 1945.</p>

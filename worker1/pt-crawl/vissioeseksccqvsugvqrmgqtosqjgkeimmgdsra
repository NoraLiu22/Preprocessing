the <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/africans-virginias-first/">first Africans</a></span> to arrive in the <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/colonial-virginia/">Virginia colony</a></span> in 1619. She appears in the census of 1624 as “Angela a Negar” and the next year as “Angelo a Negro Woman in the <em>Treasurer</em>.” Likely born in present-day Angola, Angela was one of 350 African men and women captured by Portuguese raiders and their African allies in 1619 and <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/transatlantic-slave-trade-the/">sold to a Portuguese slave trader</a></span>. On the way to America, however, two English ships, the <em>White Lion</em> and the <em>Treasurer</em>, attacked the slave ship and stole about fifty of its Africans, sailing them to Virginia. There Captain <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/peirce-william-d-btw-1645-and-1647/">William Peirce</a></span> likely purchased Angela. By 1625, having survived the violence of Africa and the <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/slave-ships-and-the-middle-passage/">Middle Passage</a></span>, disease in Virginia, and a <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/anglo-powhatan-war-second-1622-1632/">deadly attack</a></span> by <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/indians-in-virginia/">Virginia Indians</a></span>, she was living in his household with Mrs. Peirce and three white <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/indentured-servants-in-colonial-virginia/">indentured servants</a></span>. Little else is known of Angela’s life, although archaeologists excavating the Peirce residence in 2017 and 2018 have discovered at least one artifact, a cowrie shell, they believe may have been connected to her labor there. Her date of death is unknown.</p></div><nav id="pagenav"></nav></header><!-- .entry-header --></div><div class="maincontent"><div class="label">READING LEVEL</div> <a href="#Grade8" class="rlinput rlheader" id="Grade8">Grade 8</a><div class="rlcontent"><p>Angela was an enslaved worker who first was <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/africans-virginias-first/">brought to the Virginia colony in 1619</a>.

She is listed as living with Captain William Pierce along with Pierce’s wife and three white indentured servants. One of 23 Africans in the colony, she is identified as “Angelo a Negro Woman in the <em>Treasurer</em>.” In later histories of <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/jamestown-settlement-early/">Jamestown</a> and she is referred to as both Angelo and Angela. Historians are unsure of why the censuses linked her with a traditionally male name. It could have been a mistake on the part of census takers, one repeated twice in a year. It may have been that her name was a version of <em>Angola</em>, Angela’s probable birthplace.

And on March 22, 1622, coordinated surprise attacks by Virginia Indians killed nearly a third of Virginia&#8217;s non-native population, an event that Angela also survived.</p><p>Little is known of Angela&#8217;s life in Virginia. Her owner, William Peirce, was captain of the Governor&#8217;s guard and commander of Jamestown Island and its blockhouses, the small fortified structures that dotted the perimeter of the settlement. He was <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/elections-in-colonial-virginia/">elected</a></span> a <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/house-of-burgesses/">burgess</a></span> in 1624 and served on the <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/governors-council-the/">governor&#8217;s Council</a></span> from 1632 to 1643. A planter and entrepreneur, Peirce ran a store in Jamestown and was heavily involved in the <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/tobacco-in-colonial-virginia/">tobacco</a></span> business initiated by his son-in-law John Rolfe, who had been the first Virginian to cultivate a marketable form of the plant. In 1625, the Peirce household included Mrs. Joane Peirce and the servants Thomas Smith, aged seventeen, and Henry Bradford, aged thirty-five, both of whom had arrived aboard the <em>Abigaile</em> in January 1625. Ester Edrife worked as a <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/women-in-colonial-virginia/">maidservant</a></span> and had been in the colony since 1619 or 1620.</p><div class="entry-image" data-attachid="73791"><img decoding="async" class="attachment-large size-large lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12496_2c45ca276a2ee1d-1024x767.jpg" alt="Cowrie Shell" width="640" height="479" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="attachment-large size-large lazyload" src="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12496_2c45ca276a2ee1d-1024x767.jpg" alt="Cowrie Shell" width="640" height="479" /></noscript></p><div class="imgcap"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/12496_2c45ca276a2ee1d/">Cowrie Shell</a></div></div><p>Although Peirce patented land outside of James City on several occasions—for instance, 650 acres on Mulberry Island in December 1619—the 1625 muster indicates that Angela lived in an urban household. She may have cooked, cleaned, and in other ways helped care for the Peirces. In 2017 and 2018, archaeologists excavating the Peirce residence at Jamestown found at least one artifact, a cowrie shell, that has generally been associated with an African presence at other sites in Virginia and may be evidence of her labor. She was not among those laborers—six white men and one African man—who <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/runaway-slaves-and-servants-in-colonial-virginia/">attempted to escape</a></span> from Peirce on July 18, 1640. In 1635, Peirce played an important role in the ousting of <span class="replacedlink"><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/harvey-sir-john-ca-1581-or-1582-by-1650/">Sir John Harvey</a></span> from the governor&#8217;s office. Harvey regained power two years later, and in 1640 the king summoned Peirce to England, where he was detained and his personal estate seized but eventually returned. It is unknown whether Angela was part of that estate. Peirce returned to Virginia and died after 1644 but before June 22, 1647. The death date of Angela is unknown.</p></div></div></div><!-- .entry-content --></div><!-- .maincontent --><div class="externallinks"></div> <!--    Additional Media--><div id="maptrigger" class="relatedcontentw wrapper"><div class="innerwrap"><div class="label">RELATED CONTENT</div><div class="relatedcontent"><div class="related"><div class="relatedtitle">Categories:</div><ul class="taxlist"><li><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/category/african-american-history/" rel="tag">African American History</a></li><li><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/category/colonial-history-ca-1560-1763/" rel="tag">Colonial History (ca. 1560–1763)</a></li><li><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/category/slavery/" rel="tag">Slavery</a></li></ul></div><div class="related"><div class="relatedtitle">Type:</div><ul class="taxlist"><li><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/type/biography/" rel="tag">Biography</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div> <!--    Map--><div class="mapw wrapper" id="map"><div class="map"><div class="label">MAP</div><div id="place-map"> <!-- Map displays here --></div></div></div> <!--    Timeline--><div class="timelinew wrapper" id="timeline"><div class="timeline"><div class="label">TIMELINE</div><div class="chronitem"> <span class="date" id="chron0">1575 </span><div class="chrondescription">The Portuguese send a military expedition to the mouth of the Kwanza River in central Africa in search of silver.</div></div><div class="chronitem"> <span class="date" id="chron1">1580 </span><div class="chrondescription">The death of King Henry, of Portugal, leads to a dynastic union with Spain and Spanish access to Portugal's sources of slaves in Africa.</div></div><div class="chronitem"> <span class="date" id="chron2">1618—1619 </span><div class="chrondescription">Luis Mendes de Vasconçelos leads campaigns against Kimbundu-speaking people in West Central Africa, capturing thousands.

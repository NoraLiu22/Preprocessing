<p>
Dr. David A. Bositis, (BA, Northwestern, MA, PhD, Southern Illinois University), who has been at the Joint Center since 1990, is the author, co-author or editor of six books, including the recently released Voting Rights and Minority Representation; in addition, he has authored eleven monographs, and numerous scholarly articles, analyses, and reports. Prior to working at the Joint Center, he taught political science at the George Washington University and SUNY-Potsdam.
</p>

<p>
Since 1992, Dr. Bositis has designed and managed 22 national surveys for the Joint Center, which have included more than 25,000 respondents. These surveys include studies done for the U.S. Army, HBO, Fortune, and U.S. corporations. These surveys have included national surveys of the African American and Hispanic populations and the general population, as well as specialized national surveys of black elected officials, young adults, black churches, minority owned businesses, and black professionals. The most recent publications from these surveys are Black Churches and the Faith-Based Initiative, Diverging Generations: The Transformation of African American Policy Views, and Changing of the Guard: Generational Differences Among Black Elected Officials.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Bositis is a voting rights and redistricting expert, who has published widely in this area, and has appeared as an expert witness in both state and federal court. Dr. Bositis worked with the late Judge A. Leon Higgenbotham, Jr. in defending majority-minority districts following the U.S. Supreme Court's Shaw v. Reno decision. Dr. Bositis' research was cited by Justice Stevens in the Bush v. Vera case.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Bositis is also a scholar of political parties and representation and has written extensively on those topics, including the Congressional Black Caucus. Since 1992, he has written the popular monograph series, Blacks and the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. In 2000, the U.S. State Department sent Dr. Bositis to Tanzania, Zanzibar, Zambia, and South Africa to speak on issues of representation. Dr. Bositis traveled to Benin several times in the mid-1990s to provide training and to work with NGOs that were conducting presidential election studies.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Bositis is also a scholar of black politics and voting, and the Joint Center has published his election analyses following each national election since 1992. Since 1997, Dr. Bositis has also been the author of the yearly Joint Center series on black elected officials entitled 'Black Elected Officials: A Statistical Analysis'.

				<h1>Did You Know?</h1>
				 


<p>
Did you know that more than two-fifths (42 percent) of African Americans surveyed in a October-November 2005 Joint Center survey expect that their own retirement savings and investments will be their major source of income in retirement? However, only 51 percent have any money in savings accounts, certificates of deposit, or money market funds. Furthermore, only 16 percent have money invested in bonds, only 31 percent have investments in stocks or mutual fund shares, and only 24 percent have an IRA or Keogh plan

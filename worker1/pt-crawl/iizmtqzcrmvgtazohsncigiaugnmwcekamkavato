These are not official, but a few ideas I had for some of the London Boroughs that do not have a badge.

<p><b>BADGE:</b> <i>Out of a Saxon Crown a demi Lion Or with the Wings and Tail of a Dragon Azure supporting a Staff Gules flying therefrom a Banner Azure charged with four Bars wavy Argent.</i></p>

<td BGCOLOR="#FFF0C0">

<p><b>LONDON BOROUGH OF BRENT</b><br>
<br>
The Saxon Crown like that in the Borough's crest was commom to the arms of the former Boroughs of Wembley and Willesden, as well as the arms of the Middlesex County Council. It represents the Saxon origins of the area. The lion is derived from the Borough's dexter supporter, ultimately from the arms of Wembley, this is fused with the wings and tail of the sinister dragon supporter, ultimately from the arms of Willesden, to represent the union of the two areas. The blue and white waves on the banner represent the the River Brent, which once seperated the two former boroughs, but whose name now unites them.</p>

<p><b>BADGE:</b> <i>A Roundel Gules ensigned by a Saxon Crown and charged with three Acorns each with two Leaves their stalks conjoined Or.</i></p>
</td>

<td BGCOLOR="#FFF0C0">

<p><b>LONDON BOROUGH OF EALING</b><br>
<br>
The three conjoined acorns with their leaves represent the union of three former boroughs. The oak tree was common to the former arms of the Boroughs of Ealing and Acton, in which it referred to the ancient forest west of London. The oak is also appropriate to the origins of Southall "the southern holt" and Norwood "the northern wood". The tree in the modern borough arms is shown with twenty golden acorns. The roundel is coloured red, like background of the former arms of the Middlesex County Council, and is ensigned with a Saxon crowns in gold, common to the arms of Acton, Southall and Middlesex itself.</p>

<p><b>BADGE:</b> <i>A Roundel Vert thereon upon Water proper a Paschal Lamb Argent supporting over the dexter shoulder a Crosier Or flowing therefrom a Pennon also Argent charged with a Cross Gules all within an Annulet Sable charged with fifteen Bezants.</i></p>
</td>

<td BGCOLOR="#FFF0C0">

<p><b>LONDON BOROUGH OF LAMBETH</b><br>
<br>
The paschal lamb with pennon, as in the crest, has always formed part of the seal of the late Vestry and of the former Metropolitan Borough Council, and in heraldic terms is a "canting" or punning reference to the name of the Borough. The wavy lines under the lamb represent water, and refer to the fact that the Borough has a considerable frontage to the River Thames. The fifteen bezants, like those on the border of the Borough's shield, are taken from the arms of the Duchy of Cornwall, whose London estates are at Kennington in the Borough.</p>

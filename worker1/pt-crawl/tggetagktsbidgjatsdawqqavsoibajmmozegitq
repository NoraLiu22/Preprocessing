<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Characterized today by its rapid
development as a dynamic corporate center, the City of Stamford
boasts a long and colorful history as a prosperous manufacturing
town.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">During the years following the
Industrial revolution, Stamford, as well as many other industrial
cities of the Northeast, became known for its manufactured products,
the wide variety of goods which were &#171;Made in
Stamford.&#187;</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Early products manufactured in
    the city included dyes, licorice, stoves, shoes, and carriages. In 1868,
    The
Yale Lock Company opened its doors for the first time, heralding
Stamford's future as &#171;The Lock City.&#187; Other industries
flourished In the later years of the 19th and well into the 20th
century, providing the country, and the world, with diverse products
ranging from wallpaper and chocolates to postage meters, typewriters,
and electric razors.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the 1950s and 60s, Stamford
    began to
experience a decline in industry as the dominant force in its
economy. Many manufacturers ceased operations or relocated away from
the decaying northern industrial cities during this period. Stamford
lost much of its economic base with the gradual retreat of the Yale &amp; Towne
Manufacturing Company which commenced in 1948. However, unlike many cities of
similar size and type which were unable to
bounce back from the devastating industrial decline, Stamford shifted
gears and began to develop a new, broader-based economy.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today Stamford is home to many
    national and international corporations. New industry based on the needs
    of
growing technological fields has been successfully introduced and
employs a significant portion of the city's population. Although no
longer the easily identifiable consumer goods of previous eras,
products &#171;Made in Stamford&#187; continue to play an important
role in the economy of our city and our nation.</font></p>
<p align="center">
  

    <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">  * * *</font>

</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stamford, a New England Puritan settlement founded 
  in 1641, was a self-sufficient agrarian community. For two hundred years farming 
  and animal husbandry comprised the base of the economy, and all early industries 
  were closely linked to agriculture. Grist, saw, wire, and woolen mills operated 
  along Stamford's rivers. Spinning, weaving, basket making, harness and shoe 
  making, tanning, carpentry and cabinetry, and blacksmithery were conducted in 
  small workshops or in the home. Marine commerce and construction and fishing-especially 
  oyster fishing-also supported Stamford's people.<a href="#1">&#91;1&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As Stamford approached the mid-19th
century, it, like the northern United States as a whole, was entering
a new economic age. The Industrial Revolution was coming to America,
enlarging, specializing, and mechanizing the American industrial
process. By 1850 certain requirements necessary for industrial
growth, such as technological advances and innovations in the way
businesses were financed and organized had been made. The
corporation, a device which had been in existence since the 18th
century, was well established by the beginning of the 19th century
and was becoming more accepted as a legitimate business form.
    <a href="#2">[2&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Banks, sparce before the Revolution,
grew quickly in number during the early decades of the 19th century.
Stamford Bank, Stamford's first bank, was chartered in 1834 and
became a national bank in 1863. A second institution, Stamford
Savings Bank, was chartered in 1851. Citizen's Savings Bank, the
third, in 1869, and the Stamford Trust Company in
1889.<a href="#3">&#91;3&#93;</a> &nbsp;The growth of
banks together with the corporation provided the investment capital crucial for
the support of
manufacturing.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The American factory was born In the
early 19th century. The concept of the factory as a building where
workers, mechanization, and power were brought together was developed
in England during the previous century with a high degree of success,
especially in the textile industry.<a href="#4">&#91;4&#93;</a> &nbsp;American
industry now began its transformation from hand craftsmanship and water power
to machine production and steam
power.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The twenty-year period from 1830 to 1850
saw dramatic advances in transportation that created an environment
favorable for the location of industry in Stamford. Land
transportation had always been arduous and slow even along the
nation's best roads, but travel along the nation's waterways was both
faster and cheaper. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 and its
immediate success touched off a nationwide canal building boom which
was felt in Stamford. In 1831 townsmen approved a plan to extend the
east branch of the harbor to the center of town by digging a canal.
Completed in 1833, the canal reached to just behind Atlantic Square,
allowing schooners and sloops to dock right at the hub of the
village. When the railroad tracks were laid, the canal north of the
railroad was closed, and beginning in 1868 the lower section was
widened to 80 feet and dug to a depth of 9 feet deeper to accommodate
more and larger vessels. Salt marshes on either side of the canal
were filled in with the excavated dirt, thereby making the banks
suitable for industrial development.<a href="#5">&#91;5&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The advent of the railroad was a
transportation revolution and a significant factor in the
acceleration of the industrialization of the northern United States.
On December 19, 1848, accompanied by much drama and excitement, the
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051025111332/http://www.stamfordhistory.org/m_train.htm">first
iron horse</a> passed through
Stamford on the New York-New Haven Railroad, placing the town on a
major freight and passenger routes.<a href="#6">&#91;6&#93;</a> &nbsp;The
opening of the railroad had another important consequence that stimulated manufacturing
in Stamford. The railroad brought
hundreds of immigrants to Stamford, first the Irish and Germans and
later other Europeans. They formed a ready semi-skilled and unskilled
labor pool for industry.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The coming together of all of these
forces in American life gradually transformed Stamford from a quiet,
homogeneous farming town into a bustling, diversified manufacturing
city in the half century following the Civil War.</font></p>
<p align="center">

    <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">  * * *</font>

</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The appearance of all the elements of
modern industrial society did not mean that such a society was
created in Stamford overnight. The factory did not signal the
immediate disappearance of workshops or home manufacturing. Relying
on the water power of the Mill River as water fell over the dam near
Main Street, between 1850 and 1852 George Watson operated the only
pottery known to have existed in Stamford. The operation was
dependent on the water for washing the clay and providing the power
to break it up and grind the glaze.<a href="#7">&#91;7&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">An early and important Stamford
manufacturer which straddled the pre-industrial and industrial eras
was the Stamford Manufacturing Company, situated at today's Cove
Park. The Stamford Manufacturing Company was organized in 1844 by
brothers John and Henry Sanford, who purchased the two flour mills
constructed at the Cove in 1791 by William Fitch and John W. Holly. A
pre-Industrial Revolution manufacturer, the company first relied on
tidal flows for power before converting to steam power. The company
ground dyewoods for dyes, processed spices, and made licorice.
Stamford Manufacturing Company continually grew in size and
prominence. Through the 19th century the company was a leading local
industry and one which served to place the city on the world map. It
was said to have been the largest operation of its kind in the world.
Dyes of various colors developed by the company were highly acclaimed
and sought after. Though partially destroyed twice by fires, the
company rebounded. In the 20th century the development of synthetic
analine dyes cut deeply into the company's markets, and the outbreak
of World War I seriously interfered with its business. The company
stayed in business until 1919 when on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051025111332/http://www.stamfordhistory.org/covefire.htm">February
19</a> a third conflagration
levelled the factory and forced a total shutdown of
operations.<a href="#8">&#91;8&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">James Sheffield operated a workshop at
the Cove between 1856 and 1879. Sheffield's prime customer was the
neighboring Stamford Manufacturing Company, which he supplied with
tools and metal barrel hoops. In 1878 Sheffield mortgaged his steam
engine, boiler, and pump, sold his land the following year, and
apparently went out of business.<a href="#9">&#91;9&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another significant Stamford
manufacturer with an early beginning was the Stamford Foundry
Company, begun by George E. Waring about 1830 at his small foundry on
Long Ridge Road near the New York State boundary. Waring conducted a
large business in the production of stoves of all kinds, and also of
agricultural implements, cast iron fences, and grills for many years
after 1830. In 1836 Waring moved his foundry to the head of Atlantic
Street, then to West Main Street at the Mill River's edge, and
finally to Canal Street just south of Atlantic Square in 1851. The
Stamford Foundry Co. was the only stove foundry in Connecticut and
the oldest stove foundry in the nation. It manufactured wood- and
coal-burning cast iron heating and cooking stoves as well as ranges
of every size and variety. Stamford stoves were used in homes,
churches, factories, stores, hotels, warehouses, and even aboard
ships. The foundry, which remained in business until 1954, eventually
manufactured gas and electric stoves, some of which may still be
found in kitchens around the world.<a href="#10">&#91;10&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beginning in 1853 the lumber company of
Hoyt, Getman and Judd carried on a large business at the canal dock.
As the company grew, the manufacturing segment of the business was
separated from the mercantile aspects and incorporated in 1855 under
the name of the St. John Wood Working Company. St. John's
manufactured quality house trimmings, sashes, blinds, and hardwood
finishings for which it earned a high reputation. The company
operated until 1935 while Getman and Judd carried on in the lumber
business until 1965.<a href="#11">&#91;11&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The advantages of Stamford's water and
rail links attracted the attention of Linus Yale, Jr., and Henry R.
Towne, who had begun a partnership in the manufacture of locks in
Shelbourne, Massachusetts. Linus Yale was an inventor and
manufacturer of bank locks eager to expand his small business when
Henry R. Towne, an engineer, met him, took an interest in his work,
and saw in it the opportunity for the development of an important new
industry. The success of the Yale Lock Company, as the partners' firm
was originally called, was based on the cylinder or five-pin tumbler
lock patented by Linus Yale in 1861. It was compact, offered many
combination variations, was virtually pick-proof, and had a
lightweight key.<a href="#12">&#91;12&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1868 Towne and Yale decided
    to move their business to Stamford, choosing a site between the canal and
    the
railroad along Pacific and Market streets in the South End. Although
Linus Yale died suddenly on Christmas Day 1868, Towne pressed ahead
with construction of the factory and opened in May 1869. Towne
acquired sole ownership of the company, and in 1883 renamed it the
Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing Company. He acted as company president
until 1915 and chairman of the board until his death in
1924.&#91;<a href="#13">13&#93;</a> &nbsp;Gifted with
exceptional organizational skills, <a href="towne1905.htm">Towne
instituted a modern factory system</a>
to replace what had formerly been done by hand.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yale &amp; Towne produced some of the
most outstanding hardware in the country and made notable advances in
the design of post office boxes and locks and blocks and pulleys. The
success of the Yale &amp; Towne Company was so complete that the
company rapidly expanded its physical plant and work force. In the
company's first three years of operation the number of workers rose
from 30 to 150. By 1892 the company occupied 21 acres in the South
End (the complex eventually topped off at 25 acres) and employed
nearly 1,000 people out of a total population of nearly 16,000 or one
in every 16 Stamford residents. In 1907 that number had risen to
3,000 and by 1916 it had reached 5,000.<a href="#14">&#91;14&#93;</a></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The city's largest single employer
    and
manufacturing firm, Yale &amp; Towne dominated Stamford's economy
within 25 years of its establishment and continued to do so until it
departed in the 1950s.<a href="#15">&#91;15&#93;</a> &nbsp;The predominance of the firm is reflected in the nickname
&#171;The Lock City&#187; chosen by the city in the early 1900s. The
seal of the City of Stamford also bears a depiction of two Yale &amp; Towne keys.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although Yale &amp; Towne was the outstanding manufacturing 
  company during the 19th century and for quite some time afterward, it was by 
  no means the only one in Stamford. Located at Waterside, the B. Keith &amp; Co.
  manufactured drugs and chemicals beginning in 1865.<a href="#16">&#91;16&#93;</a> Carriages
  and wagons were made in town by several establishments, among them The Phoenix
  Company, and the shops operated by Hugh Neil and William Wilson &amp; Co. at
  Mill River Bridge and Canal Street, respectively.<a href="#17">&#91;17&#93;</a> &nbsp;Water pipes, stove linings, fire bricks 
  and pottery goods were manufactured by Union Fire Brick and Drain Tile Works
  which operated first at Waterside, then at the Canal Dock from 1845 until 1896.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Simon Ingersoll, a Stamford native
    who was well known as a prolific inventor, invented in 1871 a steam rock
    drill. His &#171;American 
  Wonder Rock Drill&#187; sold widely in this country and abroad and was used
  extensively in railroad construction and in the mining and quarrying industries
  for boring shot holes for blasting. Ingersoll incorporated the Ingersoll Mfg.
  Co. in 1882 at a Canal Street location and manufactured ratchet drills, pumps,
  well curbs, and other machinery.<a href="#18">&#91;18&#93;</a> &nbsp;In 1873 
  Edwin Hoyt, Jr., patented a washing machine which he claimed had &#171;new and 
  useful improvements.&#187; Hoyt's machine was designed with two wooden rollers
  and two composition wiper blades through which the clothes were drawn by hand.<a href="#19">&#91;19&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For a number of years beginning in 1873, billiard 
  tables were a Stamford-made product. In that year H.W. Collender established 
  his firm in a large five-story factory at the head of Pacific Street. The H.W. 
  Collender Co. was the leading billiard manufacturer in the country, employing 
  200 persons in 1881. Though it was entirely destroyed by fire on the night of 
  February 14, 1883, at an estimated loss of $200,000, Collender rebuilt and opened 
  as the Collender Wood Working Co. in 1885. Shortly thereafter the firm merged, 
  forming the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co., and the manufacturing of tables was 
  discontinued at the Stamford factory.<a href="#20">&#91;20&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Apparel for the head and the foot could be purchased 
  from Stamford-based manufacturers. In 1881 the manufacture of straw hats by 
  the Stamford Straw Hat Works began. The company was reorganized in 1892 as the 
  T.B. Smart Co. The factory located at Pacific and Walnut streets produced hats 
  at an annual rate of 20,000 cases or nearly one million hats per year. Smart 
  employed 300 persons, two-thirds of whom were women who sewed and braided the 
  straw into hats.<a href="#21">&#91;21&#93;</a> &nbsp;Women's and children's 
  shoes of the latest styles could be purchased from Lounsbury &amp; Soule Company. 
  Begun as a small workshop In Long Ridge in 1858, the company moved into a new 
  factory on Broad Street in 1885 where in 1892 it was turning out 1,500 to 1,800 
  pairs a week using the labor of about 100 persons. Lounsbury &amp; Soule remained
  in business until 1923, and the factory it operated was until recently occupied
  by Dress Barn. a women's clothing store.<a href="#22">&#91;22&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A wall covering desired by many
    Victorian ladies in Europe and America for the decoration of their homes
    began to be manufactured
  in Stamford in 1883. The wall covering known as Lincrusta-Walton was patented
    by Mr. Walton and first produced in England by the Lincrusta-Walton Manufacturing
    Company. Because of its popularity in this country, a joint stock company
    was
  formed here and a factory constructed on 8 3/4 acres on lower Canal Street.
    Lincrusta-Walton wall covering simulated the look of wood carving and embossed
    leather. It was tough and elastic, it could be stamped or raised into any
    pattern,
  and it could be painted. Frederick Beck, who conducted the Stamford business,
  purchased the concern and around 1890 renamed it Fr. Beck &amp; Company.<a href="#23">&#91;23&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The closing decade of the 19th century witnessed 
  the establishment of new manufacturers in Stamford, increasing the scope of 
  Stamford-made products. The South End, the roughly triangular area bordered 
  by the Sound, harbor, canal, and railroad, took on the role as the town's principal 
  manufacturing district. Factories were built along the canal, and railroad spurs 
  were laid directly into the interiors of the factory yards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some of the manufacturers to settle
    in Stamford late in the century were Davenport &amp; Tracey Co. in 1887, maker of piano plates 
  and hardware; Schleicher &amp; Sons in 1892, a manufacturer of pianos; the Stone 
  and Taylor Company in 1891, producer of wood and paper boxes; the Stamford Hosiery 
  and Suspender Co., producer of suspenders and stockings; and the National Mosaic 
  &amp; Tile Company in 1893, a maker of tubes and tiles for interior floors
  and exterior ornamental trimmings.<a href="#24">&#91;24&#93;</a></font>
  <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="eagle" id="eagle"></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For a short time of about four years, the Eagle Bicycle 
  Company on lower Atlantic Street built a new safety bicycle in Stamford. The 
  company's founder, Leonard B. Gaylor, patented a high wheel bicycle of an improved 
  design which added a handbrake and placed the small wheel in the front and the 
  large wheel in back, rather than the front, in order to give the rider better 
  balance. The Eagle Bicycle Co. was organized in 1883 with capital amounting 
  to $50,000.<a href="#25">&#91;25&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Shortly after the turn of the century in 1902, brothers 
  Max and Abraham Baer moved their company, Baer Bros., to Stamford from New York. 
  It was there in 1888 that the men had begun the business of jobbing bronze powders 
  imported from Germany. By the time they settled their firm in Stamford, the 
  brothers had entered into production themselves. Shortly after opening a factory 
  on Canal Street, they enlarged their business to include the manufacture of 
  gold and aluminum paints and the operation of a shellac bleachery. As operations 
  expanded, Baer Bros. opened a second plant on Fairfield Avenue which they maintained 
  in continuous operation until 1958. The company's product line grew to include 
  paints, enamels, varnishes, lacquers and shellac, gold aluminum bronzes, and 
  leaf.<a href="#26">&#91;26&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Only twenty years after the typewriter had come into 
  practical use, a Stamford resident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051025111332/http://www.stamfordhistory.org/blickens.htm">George 
  C. Blickensderfer</a>, invented a new kind of typewriter 1892 in his small workshop 
  at the rear of his Bedford Street home. In order produce his invention, he founded 
  The Blickensderfer Manufacturing Company in 1889, renting space on Garden Street 
  until the construction of a spacious factory on lower Atlantic Street in 1896. 
  Blickensderfer's typewriter, which featured the principle of revolving type, 
  became the world's best seller, and the company became one of the world's largest 
  typewriter manufacturers. His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051025111332/http://www.stamfordhistory.org/bl_model8.htm">model 
  #8</a> was one of the first and said to be the best portable typewriter invented.
  The &#171;Blick&#187; typewriter could be outfitted with different type styles
  and for foreign languages. When World War I cut off the company's large export
  markets, Blickensderfer invented a belt-loading device for machine guns and
  received enough orders from the French government to keep the company solvent.
  George Blickensderfer died in 1917, and three years later his company was taken
  over by the L.R. Roberts Typewriter Company.<a href="#27">&#91;27&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="phillips" id="phillips"></a>Another Stamford resident whose 
  product became nationally and even internationally known was Charles H. Phillips, 
  inventor of <a href="phillipsmm.htm">milk of magnesia</a>. Phillips, a pharmacist
  from England, moved to Glenbrook where he established the Phillips Camphor
  and
  Wax Company. It was in Stamford that he concocted and received a patent in
  1873 for &#171;hydrate of magnesia mixed with water&#187; which he called &#171;Milk 
  of Magnesia.&#187; Phillips produced milk of magnesia as well as other pharmaceuticals
  at his Glenbrook firm which incorporated in 1885 as the Charles H. Phillips
  Company. After Phillips' death in 1882, his four sons ran the corporation until
  1923, at which time it was acquired by Sterling Drug, Inc. Phillip's Milk of
  Magnesia is of course still manufactured today, but the last familiar blue
  bottle
  to be filled in Stamford was in 1976 when production at the Glenbrook plant
  was phased out.<a href="#28">&#91;28&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1898 a David versus Goliath
    battle took place between Elisha Mix, Jr., founder of Excelsior Hardware,
    and the mighty Yale &amp; Towne Mfg. Co. When Yale &amp; Towne demoted Mix and cut his pay, he secretly 
  worked after hours at his own lock-making company which he located in Bridgeport 
  so as not to arouse the suspicions of Yale &amp; Towne management. Mix came 
  from a line of talented lock makers. His father, Elisha Sr., was a lock maker 
  and his grandfather, James Mix, was a die maker for some of the first locks 
  manufactured in the county. Soon Mix informed Yale &amp; Towne that he was quitting 
  to run his own firm, and the company promptly fired his son Moseley, who also 
  worked for the lock giant. When Mix was unable to sell his Stamford home to 
  move to Bridgeport, father and son moved the operation in 1901 to Woodland Avenue 
  in the very shadow of the Yale &amp; Towne complex. Excelsior Hardware Company
  has the distinction of being the oldest manufacturing company begun and still
  operating in Stamford. The first products manufactured by the firm were trunk
  and drawer locks. Excelsior later added suitcase and automobile trunk locks
  to its line. Today at its several locations in the South End Excelsior continues
  to manufacture a long and varied line of locks and luggage hardware.<a href="#29">&#91;29&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As industry in Stamford expanded and began to dominate 
  the economic base of the town, the industrialists assumed a vocal and active 
  role in the life of the community. Two organizations formed by leading industrialists 
  were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051025111332/http://www.stamfordhistory.org/rg9.htm">The Stamford Board of 
  Trade</a> in 1890 and The Manufacturers' Association in 1905. The intentions 
  and aims of the groups were alike. They both promoted Stamford and sought to 
  increase dialogue between business leaders and to improve the city's transportation 
  facilities. The Manufacturers' Association, moreover, directly involved itself 
  in city government and acted as a strong force in the promotion and acquisition 
  of increased municipal services. The Association lobbied for efficient fire 
  and police protection, good streets and sidewalks, and stringent regulations 
  governing public health and safety.<a href="#30">&#91;30&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1907 and 1909 the Gillespie Brothers, publishers 
  of the Advocate, issued special industrial editions in recognition of the importance 
  of manufacturing in Stamford. Several new industries had now joined the roster 
  of Stamford manufacturers in the first decade of the century. Among them were: 
  The Remington Oil Engine Company, which produced an industrial engine at its 
  Pacific Street plant between 1907 and 1922; the Atlantic Insulated Wire and 
  Cable Company, makers of interior, aerial, underground, and submarine wires 
  and cables from 1903 to 1923 at the canal; the Zapon Company, which arrived 
  in 1904 to make lacquers, finishes, and coated fabrics; Star Manufacturing Company, 
  producers of glycerine soap, furniture polish, and lubrication oil; and Bishop 
  Boxes, which fabricated boxes and paper bags.<a href="#31">&#91;31&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Model airplane operation received a great boost in 
  1911 from two brothers in Stamford who developed the first internal combustion 
  reciprocating model airplane engine. Whitney Echert, and his brother, whose 
  name is unknown, maintained what seems to have been a basement enterprise on 
  Pulaski Street where they carried out their Baby Engine Company's business and 
  maintained a sort of experimental shop and probably assembly plant as well. 
  Their model engine, called the Baby Engine, weighed 3 3/4 pounds, had a capacity 
  of 1/2 horsepower at 9,300 r.p.m. and sold for $35. The Echerts' engine is thought 
  by some to be the earliest model engine produced in the United States. The Echerts' 
  move west sometime in 1914 apparently Initiated the demise of the Baby Engine 
  Company. Although in business for a short time, the brothers heavily promoted 
  their engine to model airplane builders. They offered to furnish engines to 
  any builder in the New York aero Club who would compete in a gas model meet. 
  The meet, which took place probably in the fall of 1913 (the exact date is not 
  known) at Mineola Field, Mineola, Long Island, made history as the first gaspowered 
  model airplane meet in the United States and probably in the world.<a href="#32">&#91;32&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1915 the New York headquartered Erskine-Danforth 
  Corporation opened a factory at 490 Pacific Street for the manufacture of Danersk 
  furniture and home accessories. Danersk furniture was previously crafted in 
  North Carolina until for economic and growth reasons the company moved operations 
  and practically its entire staff to Stamford. New York remained the location 
  of the company's office and showroom. Danersk furniture was advertised as attractive, 
  soundly crafted, high quality furniture at an inexpensive price. Apparently 
  the Depression and resulting sharp fall off in the purchase of consumer goods 
  during the 1930s caused the demise of the Erskine-Danforth Corporation. The 
  company disappears from the City Directory after 1932 and until 1938, at which 
  time it reappears under the name The Danersk Craftsmen, Inc. The revitalized 
  company was located in Noroton on the Post Road opposite Ring's End Road until 
  1943 when it relocated to Garden Street in Stamford.<a href="#33">&#91;33&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It was in the second decade of
    the 20th century that the company that would become the city's major employer
    after the departure
  of Yale &amp; Towne, Pitney Bowes, started operations in Stamford. In 1917
  the firm began business as the Universal Stamping Machine Company on Pacific
  and
  Walnut streets. Co-founder Walter H. Bowes had started selling check-endorsing
  machines in 1909. In 1910 he began the design of stamp-cancelling machines
  for
  use in post offices, and in 1914 he conceived plans for a practical machine
  capable of stamping postage, postmarking the date, and recording the amount
  of postage stamped. Then in 1919, Bowes joined wits and talent with Arthur
  H.
  Pitney, who since 1900 had been working on a postage meter of his own in Chicago,
  to form the Pitney Bowes Company. The company's business was stimulated when
  it was chosen to supply the postage meters to the postal system after Congress
  had authorized the meter system in 1920. Pitney Bowes made postal history on
  November 16, 1920, when the first postage meter was set, locked, sealed, and
  placed in service to dispatch prepared mail for Pitney Bowes. Today the firm
  is the largest manufacturer of postal machines and has expanded its operations
  to include the manufacture of other office machines and equipment as well.<a href="#34">&#91;34&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Henry Ford's successful invention
    and introduction of the automobile in the early 20th century sparked an American
    love affair
  with the automobile which, of course, still continues today. For a few years
    in the 1920s cars actually rolled off an assembly line here in Stamford.
    In
  1924 Victor W. Page opened an automobile company about which little is known.
    The plant on Milrose Avenue turned out the Page Aero type four automobile.
    The
  company hailed the car because of its &#171;driver design,&#187; durability, 
  and riding qualities. Priced at $650, the Page automobile was billed as the 
  &#171;Poor Man's High-Grade Car.&#187; Its engine was air cooled, required
  no water, and got 25 miles to the gallon. The firm achieved limited success
  and
  closed in 1927.<a href="#35">&#91;35&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The automobile industry gave rise
    to a host of allied industries, one being the manufacture of tires and tubes.
    Not many years after
  he made his home in Stamford after having left his native Germany, Arnold L.
    Schavoir gave up his job at the Blickensderfer Mfg. Co. to begin his own
    business
  selling, repairing, and retreading automobile tires. By 1914 Schavoir entered
    into the manufacture of auto tubes at his shop on Lee Street. The Schavoir
    Rubber
  Company extended its operations five years later to include the manufacture
    of rubber toys, dolls and balls, and &#171;mechanical rubber goods.&#187; In
    1923 the company moved to Shippan Avenue and ten years later in 1933 into
    a
  former printing plant on Fahey Street in Springdale behind Emmanuel Chapel.
  Arnold Schavoir died in 1936, and his company went out of business in 1940.<a href="#36">&#91;36&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another automobile-related industry
    was concerned with the manufacture of ball bearings. The Norma-Hoffman Bearings
    Corp. grew
  from its small beginnings in 1911 in the Bronx to become an important manufacturing
    firm after relocating in Stamford in 1924. At its facility on Hamilton Avenue,
    Norma-Hoffman turned out bearings for airplane engines, instruments, battle-ships,
    cruisers, submarine chasers, and for anti-aircraft guns. It had contracts
    to
  supply such large companies as Boeing, Lockheed, and Pratt &amp; Whitney. The 
  company pioneered the development of many distinctive types of bearings and 
  was one of the top firms in its field. By 1941 Norma-Hoffman employed some 1,200 
  people in its factory and research lab. In 1969 Norma-Hoffman was bought by 
  the German company FAG (Fischer Aktien Gesellschaft, translated &#171;Fisher 
  Joint Stock Company&#187;) which ten years later moved the production of bearings
  elsewhere. FAG maintained a distribution center and corporate headquarters
  in
  Stamford and refurbished the factory buildings to form an industrial park now
  occupied by half a dozen manufacturers.<a href="#37">&#91;37&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stamford can claim a number of firsts. Another significant 
  innovation occurred in a loft of a Stamford home where the electric dry shaver 
  industry was born. Colonel Jacob Schick made by hand the first electric shaver 
  for which he received a patent in 1928. Schick's invention was two decades in 
  the making. He had tinkered with the idea and design since before 1910 while 
  serving in the army in Alaska and the Phillipines. Schick had a successful army 
  career. During World War I he was placed in charge of the transportation of 
  American troops to England and also served as head of the Division of Intelligence 
  and Criminal Investigation. Schick sold his first shaver in 1931 to Lanier P. 
  McLachlen, a banker in Washington D.C., for $25. By 1940 Schick employed 1,000 
  workers at his Garden Street factory. Schick died in 1937, but the industry 
  which he founded continued in Stamford until 1955 at which time the firm moved 
  to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.<a href="#38">&#91;38&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A newcomer to Stamford in the 1930s
    was Machlett Laboratories which, although new to town, had a beginning that
    went back to
  1897 in New York City. Machlett's, as the company is popularly known, was founded
    by Ernest Machlett of Germany who as a widower with two children came to
    the
  United States to work at his trade as a glass blower and expert in engraving,
    etching, and grinding glass. His son Robert, whom he had schooled in precision
    glass work. persuaded his father to set up their own business. E. Machlett &amp; Son
    was incorporated in 1899 as a small supplier of precision glass laboratory
    equipment. Robert Machlett was a man of uncommon ability. He pioneered in
    the
  field of x-rays. Two years after Roentgen's discovery of the x-ray in 1895,
    Robert Machlett created the first practical x-ray tube in America and devoted
    his life to perfecting the device. Many subsequent advances in the technology,
    such as water-cooled tubes and x-ray proof tubes were introduced by Machlett.
    As a result of his work with x-rays, Robert Machlett fell victim to the effects
    of radiation and died in 1926. His son Raymond, however, continued in the
    field
  and perfected the process of producing tubes filled with rarefied gasses free
    from impurities. In 1931 Raymond reorganized his father and grandfather's
    company
  into Machlett Laboratories. In 1934 he moved the company from New York to Springdale
    where it expanded and has continued to be a leader in the research and development
  of x-ray technology and equipment.<a href="#39">&#91;39&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Over the span of a century of industrial development, 
  Stamford was the home, native or adopted, of many ingenious and inventive people. 
  Peter M. Sivertsen was just such a person. Sivertsen was a Norwegian who immigrated 
  to New York City where as a young man he took a job in a Brooklyn delicatessen. 
  At the delicatessen Sivertsen observed both the limitations and deficiencies 
  of the meat slicers then in use and set out to invent a better one. Sivertsen 
  patented a gravity-fed bed slicer and launched a new corporation, The Globe 
  Slicing Machine Company, with partner Lewis Novoting. In 1939 Sivertsen and 
  Novoting moved their factory to Stamford on Selleck Street where the company 
  continues to design and manufacture food slicers, meat choppers, scales, and 
  meat and bone saws.<a href="#40">&#91;40&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two companies both catering to the enhancement of 
  women's beauty moved to Stamford in 1940, adding to the wide variety of Stamford-made 
  products. In June 1940 the Northam Warren Company opened a 17,000 square foot 
  plant in a spacious setting on Barry Place off Fairfield Avenue. At the time 
  The Northam Warren Company was the world's largest manufacturer of manicure 
  and deodorant products, having grown rapidly from its start by Northam Warren 
  in 1911. Northam Warren manufactured Odorono deodorants and Cutex brand nail 
  polishes and polish remover. In 1960 Cheesebrough Ponds acquired The Northam 
  Warren Company.<a href="#41">&#91;41&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The second manufacturer of beauty products was Clairol 
  Inc. The firm is presently the major producer of hair dyes and is an important 
  company in its field. Clairol's beginnings go back to Paris in the 1930s when 
  Lawrence M. Gelb, a manufacturing chemist, learned of a new formula for hair 
  coloring. When he returned to New York, Gelb began to mix and bottle the hair 
  coloring on a small scale for beauty salons in the city. As sales strengthened, 
  Gelb purchased the formula, which he marketed as Clairol Oil Shampoo Tint. In 
  1940 the Clairol Company moved its research, manufacturing, and distribution 
  operations to rented space on Fairfield Avenue. At its Stamford location, Clairol 
  invented Miss Clairol Hair Color Bath, the product that revolutionized hair 
  coloring. Not only was it the first formula to lighten, condition, and naturally 
  color the hair in one simple application, it could also be applied by women 
  on their own at home. Clairol grew rapidly, and within a dozen years of moving 
  into its new building on Commerce Road in 1950, the company was in need of a 
  new home. In 1965 Clairol purchased a 46-acre site once the property of the 
  private Daycroft School, and in 1968 the company moved into its new plant. Today 
  the Clairol product line is known world wide and has expanded to include hair 
  and skin products, cosmetics, and personal appliances.<a href="#42">&#91;42&#93;</a></font>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">* * *

</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Manufacturing grew steadily and
    strongly in Stamford for nearly a hundred years. Stamford's industries brought
    the city recognition,
  fostered development, attracted new residents, provided employment, and built
    a secure economic base for the city. The number of products &#171;Made in Stamford&#187; multiplied
    each decade until after World War II when fewer industries were attracted
    to Stamford and some of those In the city moved to new locations or closed
    their
  doors. As Stamford had partaken in the coming of the Industrial Revolution
    to the Northeast beginning in the 1840s, so, too Stamford shared in the industrial
  decline of the region during the post war years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Following World War II, Stamford manufacturers faced 
  problems common to all industry in the Northeast as peacetime production resumed. 
  As they retooled, manufacturers found that their factories, many well over a 
  half century old, were outdated and inefficient in terms of speed and cost of 
  production. The walk up, multi-storied factories impeded assembly line production 
  and made internal transport of materials difficult. Manufacturers sought to 
  construct new factories based on modern design principles that placed all phases 
  of production on one level for maximum efficiency. New sprawling factories, 
  however, needed open expanses of land that were either unavailable or unobtainable 
  in the urban areas of the Northeast because of zoning regulations, land costs, 
  and high property taxes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Simultaneously, industry faced
    increasing labor costs and strife. During the war, many shops were unionized
    for the first time. With
  the end of the conflict, unions began to place new demands on management, principally
    for higher wages. The stepped-up union activity resulted in labor strikes
    throughout
  the Northeast. In November 1945, members of the machinists' union at Yale &amp; Towne
  Manufacturing Co. walked off the job for 21 weeks over the issues of the closed
  shop and wage increases.<a href="#43">&#91;43&#93;</a> &nbsp;This kind 
  of labor unrest, combined with the difficulty of expansion for new factories
  and higher costs of doing business in the Northeast, led to management's increasingly
  frequent decision to locate to the South, where these factors were less predominant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the end of World War II, manufacturing
    accounted for more jobs in Stamford than all other employment categories
    combined. But
  by the 1950s, as the exodus of industries was taking place, more people were
    engaged in non-manufacturing jobs than in industry. The decision of Yale &amp; Towne
    in 1948 to reduce the size of its workforce symbolized the erosion of manufacturing's
    influence in Stamford's economy. In 1955 the company sold its
  plant, leasing back only 1/3 of the space for its own use. I n 1959 the company,
    Its workforce already cut to 450 employees, closed down completely, ending
    a
  long and significant chapter in Stamford history.<a href="#44">&#91;44&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Its economic base eroding, Stamford
    sought solutions. To make more industrially-zoned land available, the city
    in 1953 worked with
  the newly-formed Urban Redevelopment Commission to turn blighted land in the
    heart of the industrial district into an area suitable for light manufacturing
    or research and development. In another effort to attract the latter type
    of
  firm, the city in changed its motto to &#171;The Research City.&#187;<a href="#45">&#91;45&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The nationwide trend among corporations to relocate 
  from major cities to suburbia in the 1960s and 1970s changed the scope of Stamford's 
  economy. Beginning with the arrival of GTE in 1973, Stamford entered into a 
  new era as a base for major corporate headquarters, and land in the urban renewal 
  area originally designated for light industry was given over to office buildings 
  and hotels.<a href="#46">&#91;46&#93;</a> &nbsp;Office, service, and retail
  jobs grew quickly while the number of manufacturing jobs increased more slowly.
  Although industry has continued to decline slightly during the last two decades,
  manufacturing in the 1980s is strong and the industrial base is solid. According
  to the Stamford Economic Assistance Corporation (SEAC), approximately 350 manufacturing
  firms operating in Stamford in 1981 gave employment to about 20% of the city's
  population.<a href="#47">&#91;47&#93;</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Current products &#171;Made in Stamford&#187; are
    concentrated in chemical and allied products; electrical and electronic machinery,
    equipment, and supplies; machinery; and measuring, analyzing, and controlling
    instruments.<a href="#48">&#91;48&#93;</a> &nbsp;Though it plays a smaller
    and less visible role in the economy of Stamford, today's industry is robust
    and
  plays a vital role in the economic well-being of Stamford and its people.</font></p>

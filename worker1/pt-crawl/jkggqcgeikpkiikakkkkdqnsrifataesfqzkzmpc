<p><b><a href="/wiki/Baseball" title="Baseball">Baseball</a></b> is a <a href="/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games" title="Bat-and-ball games">bat-and-ball</a> <a href="/wiki/Sport" title="Sport">sport</a> played between two <a href="/wiki/Team_sport" title="Team sport">teams</a> of nine players each, taking turns <a href="/wiki/Batting_(baseball)" title="Batting (baseball)">batting</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fielding_(baseball)" class="mw-redirect" title="Fielding (baseball)">fielding</a>. The game occurs over the course of several <a href="/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)" title="Pitch (baseball)">plays</a>, with each play generally beginning when a player on the <a href="/wiki/Fielding_team_(baseball)" class="mw-redirect" title="Fielding team (baseball)">fielding team</a>, called the <a href="/wiki/Pitcher" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a>, throws a <a href="/wiki/Baseball_(ball)" title="Baseball (ball)">ball</a> that a player on the <a href="/wiki/Batting_team_(baseball)" class="mw-redirect" title="Batting team (baseball)">batting team</a>, called the <a href="/wiki/Batter_(baseball)" class="mw-redirect" title="Batter (baseball)">batter</a>, tries to hit with a <a href="/wiki/Baseball_bat" title="Baseball bat">bat</a>. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the <a href="/wiki/Base_(baseball)" class="mw-redirect" title="Base (baseball)">bases</a>, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "<a href="/wiki/Run_(baseball)" title="Run (baseball)">runs</a>". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming <a href="/wiki/Base_running" title="Base running">runners</a>, and to prevent runners' <a href="/wiki/Base_running" title="Base running">advance around the bases</a>. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).
</p><p>The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an <a href="/wiki/Inning" title="Inning">inning</a>. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, <a href="/wiki/Extra_innings" title="Extra innings">extra innings</a> are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature <a href="/wiki/Pace_of_play" title="Pace of play">pace-of-play</a> regulations such as the <a href="/wiki/Pitch_clock" title="Pitch clock">pitch clock</a> to shorten game time.
</p><p>Baseball evolved from older <a href="/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games" title="Bat-and-ball games">bat-and-ball games</a> already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, <a href="/wiki/History_of_baseball_in_the_United_States" title="History of baseball in the United States">where the modern version developed</a>. Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of <a href="/wiki/Escapism" title="Escapism">escapism</a> during troubled points in American history such as the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, have led the sport to receive the moniker of "America's Pastime"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the <a href="/wiki/National_sport" title="National sport">national sport</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Baseball_in_the_United_States" title="Baseball in the United States">United States</a>, though in modern times is considered <a href="/wiki/Sports_in_the_United_States#Most_popular_sports_in_the_United_States" title="Sports in the United States">less popular than other sports</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/American_football" title="American football">American football</a>. In addition to <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of <a href="/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, and <a href="/wiki/East_Asia" title="East Asia">East Asia</a>, particularly in <a href="/wiki/Baseball_in_Japan" title="Baseball in Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Baseball_in_South_Korea" title="Baseball in South Korea">South Korea</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sports_in_Taiwan#Baseball" class="mw-redirect" title="Sports in Taiwan">Taiwan</a>.

Nicknamed &quot;Mo&quot; and &quot;Sandman&quot;, he spent most of his career as a relief pitcher and served as the Yankees&#39; closer for 17 seasons. A thirteen-time All-Star and five-time World Series champion, he is MLB&#39;s career leader in saves (652) and games finished (952). Rivera won five American League (AL) Rolaids Relief Man Awards and three Delivery Man of the Year Awards, and he finished in the top three in voting for the AL Cy Young Award four times.

Raised in the modest Panamanian fishing village of Puerto Caimito, Rivera was an amateur player until he was signed by the Yankees organization in 1990. He debuted in the major leagues in 1995 as a starting pitcher, before permanently converting to a relief pitcher late in his rookie year. After a breakthrough season in 1996 as a setup man, he became the Yankees&#39; closer in 1997. In the following seasons, he established himself as one of baseball&#39;s top relievers, leading the major leagues in saves in 1999, 2001, and 2004.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, Koufax was the first three-time winner of the Cy Young Award, each time winning unanimously and the only pitcher to do so when a single award was given for both the leagues; he was also named the National League Most Valuable Player in 1963. Retiring at the age of 30 due to chronic pain in his pitching elbow, Koufax was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1972 at the age of 36, the youngest player ever elected. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Koufax was primarily a basketball player in his youth and had only pitched a handful of games before signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers at age 19. Due to the bonus rule under which he was signed, Koufax never pitched a game in the minor leagues. As a result, the first half of his career was marred with inconsistency and control problems with flashes of brilliance in between. He set a modern record by striking out 18 batters in a game in 1959 and pitched brilliantly in the 1959 World Series. However, the lack of playing time frustrated Koufax and he almost quit after 1960. After making adjustments prior to the 1961 season to improve his control, Koufax quickly rose to become the most dominant pitcher in the major leagues. He was an All-Star in each of his last six seasons, leading the National League (NL) in earned run average each of his last five years, in strikeouts four times, and in wins and shutouts three times each. He was the first NL pitcher in 20 years to post an earned run average below 2.00, doing so three times, and the first to record a 300-strikeout season three times, including a then-major league record of 382 in 1965.

The posting system (ポスティングシステム, posutingu shisutemu) is a baseball player transfer system that operates between Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and Major League Baseball (MLB). Despite the drafting of the United States – Japanese Player Contract Agreement, unveiled in 1967 to regulate NPB players moving to MLB, problems began to arise in the late 1990s. Some NPB teams lost star players without compensation, an issue highlighted when NPB stars Hideo Nomo and Alfonso Soriano left to play in MLB after using loopholes to void their existing contracts. A further problem was that NPB players had very little negotiating power if their teams decided to deal them to MLB, as when pitcher Hideki Irabu was traded to an MLB team for which he had no desire to play. In 1998, the Agreement was rewritten to address both problems; the result was dubbed the &quot;posting system&quot;.

If the player agrees on contract terms with a team before the 30-day period has expired, the NPB team receives the posting fee from the signing MLB team as a transfer fee, and the player is free to play in MLB. If no MLB team comes to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee is paid, and the player&#39;s rights revert to his NPB team.

His grandson, Ben Chandler, later served as congressman for Kentucky&#39;s Sixth District. A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1927. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon&#39;s allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon&#39;s choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race at that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state&#39;s first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state&#39;s education and transportation systems.

Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon&#39;s allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon&#39;s choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race at that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state&#39;s first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state&#39;s education and transportation systems.

Shortly after the 2006 season started, Ramírez was called up by the Rockies, and he went on to have a successful rookie season for them. In 2007, he had an 8.31 ERA with the Rockies and spent time on the disabled list and in the minor leagues. Before the 2008 season, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals.

After an inconsistent start to the 2010 season, Ramírez was traded to the San Francisco Giants. He posted a 0.67 ERA with the Giants, helping them reach the playoffs. He gave up runs in 4 of the 5 playoff games he pitched in, but the Giants won their first World Series since 1954.

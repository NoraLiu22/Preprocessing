     <b>Part 2 of 2 on Cuba</b><BR>The Catholic church, suppressed for
		decades, is undergoing a slow revival in Cuba in recent years. While it still
		exists under restrictions and its numbers have dropped, it is able, as one
		bishop said, &#147;to humbly put forward &#133; that faith is an indispensable
		ingredient for good.&#148;</font></P> 
	 <P>By DAVID EINHORN<BR><I>Havana</I></P> 
	 <P><b>E</b>ven in the worst of times, Maritza S&aacute;nchez never stopped
		attending church. Jos&eacute; Luis Torres, raised in a secular family and in
		schools that deemed religion counterrevolutionary, didn&#146;t even start
		attending until times had changed. Today both are helping the Catholic church
		work its way back into Cuba&#146;s public consciousness, S&aacute;nchez as
		director of the aid group C&aacute;ritas and Torres as coordinator of youth
		programs in Havana.</P> 
	 	 <P>Once one of Cuba&#146;s seminal institutions -- even President Fidel
		Castro attended Jesuit high schools -- the Catholic church suffered three
		decades of repression and reprisal following the socialist revolution in 1959.
		Most churches stayed open, but anyone who openly declared religious faith was
		prohibited from certain studies or careers. More than 400 Catholic schools were
		closed and confiscated.</P> 
	 <P>After having long maintained that churches were fronts for subversive
		political activity, the government reversed course in 1992, amending the
		constitution to characterize the state as secular instead of atheist. Religious
		liberties further expanded following a visit by Pope John Paul II in 1998.</P> 
	 <P>Cuba today, however, is still no bastion of religious liberty. The
		government delays immigration and residence permits for priests, denies the
		church access to the Internet, and still prohibits religious schools. The U.S.
		State Department charged in 2005 that worshipers across the religious spectrum
		are still subject to state surveillance, although Catholic church officials
		maintain that direct repression and reprisals have all but disappeared.</P> 
	 <P>The church remains cautious in dealing with the authorities out of
		concern that policies to allow more religious freedom could just as easily be
		reversed. The focus instead is on religious belief as a personal responsibility
		that transcends the institutional status of the church.</P> 
	 <P>&#147;We cannot alter the life process of a country in order to
		aggressively impose faith,&#148; said Bishop Juan de Dios Hern&aacute;ndez
		Ruiz, auxiliary bishop of Havana. &#147;The church&#146;s strategy is not so
		much to regain ground lost over time, but to humbly put forth what we are
		convinced of: that faith is an indispensable ingredient for good.&#148;</P> 
	 <P>The number of people identifying themselves as Catholics has declined
		over many years to less than half the Cuban population. At the Our Lady of
		Carmen Parish in central Havana, for example, Fr. Teodoro Becerril estimates
		weekly attendance at 2,000 worshipers -- which seems considerable until he
		notes that the number was 7,000 in 1958, the year the 70-year-old priest took
		up his post.</P> 
	 <P>Aside from problems with the government, reasons for the decline include
		the growth of Protestant denominations and the numerous exoduses from the
		island. One high-ranking church official noted that the fear that persists in
		the public mind about declaring faith is as much an obstacle today as the
		actual consequences of doing so.</P> 
	 <P>&#147;We are emerging from a period when the transmission of faith from
		generation to generation was cut,&#148; said Becerril. &#147;The situation has
		improved, but people are still cautious. They want to see where this train is
		going to stop before they commit themselves.&#148;</P> 
	 	 <P>After a boom following the constitutional change and papal visit, church
		attendance has leveled off. Of the indicators used to measure church
		participation in Cuba&#146;s largest archdiocese of Havana, only the number of
		baptisms exceeds numbers in a comparable U.S. diocese. And though Havana&#146;s
		34,000 baptisms in 2004 represented a sizable number, Becerril noted the
		special circumstances.</P> 
	 <P>&#147;Most people who bring their children for baptism are not
		practicing Catholics. They say to me, &#145;I don&#146;t want what happened to
		me to happen to my child.&#146; They want to be ready if there is another
		period of repression.&#148;</P> 
	 <P>The problem is that only 10 percent of baptized Catholics in Cuba are
		believed to attend Mass regularly, and, as the priest added, &#147;the older
		they get, the less they participate.&#148; The number of confirmations bears
		him out: only 740 in all of Havana in 2004, this in an archdiocese of 85
		parishes spanning three provinces with a population of over 3 million. The
		city&#146;s 413 Catholic marriages in 2004 was the lowest since 1993.</P> 
	 <P>Becerril said keeping the faith is difficult because &#147;the average
		young person today wants to leave the country. In Cuba, if you don&#146;t
		accept the career offered you by the state, you have no future. Some say they
		might go to the United States. So they are in a position of choosing to
		participate in a future that is uncertain.&#148;</P> 
	 <P>Torres, 31, coordinator of archdiocese youth programs for the past seven
		years, agreed that the church can expect stops and starts in the years ahead.
		As much as three-fourths of the population has never known any government other
		than the current regime.</P> 
	 	 <P>&#147;In Cuba today, religion is still something relatively new. So
		despite its long history, the church in a sense is just starting out.&#148;
		Torres said he first came to church as a young adult, out of curiosity.</P> 
	 <P>Torres runs youth programs such as an interparish soccer league that has
		23 teams and 200 participants. Most are not Catholics, however, so the church
		treads softly. &#147;The league enables us to open a dialogue with young people
		about virtues and values. But we don&#146;t pray at the games because they take
		place in public and we don&#146;t want to have any problems,&#148; Torres
		said.</P> 
	 <P>Outreach beyond traditional religious boundaries to address social
		issues also is no easy task in Cuba. With an annual budget of only $400,000,
		C&aacute;ritas provides social services through a parish-level network of
		volunteers. But unlike the situation in other countries, C&aacute;ritas in Cuba
		is prohibited from importing goods, is required to make all purchases at
		exorbitant retail prices, and is restricted to accepting donations from
		state-approved funding sources.</P> 
	 <P>&#147;What I can tell you is that we are tolerated,&#148; explained
		S&aacute;nchez, 49, director of C&aacute;ritas since it opened in 1991.
		&#147;It is difficult to develop any programs that involve collaboration
		between the church and government. The problem is the ideology that no one can
		be the protagonist in these matters except the state.&#148;</P> 
	 <P>Despite the ubiquitous role of the state in Cuban life, other factors
		affect the Catholic church in this diverse nation of 12 million people. The
		church must address issues confronting societies across the globe, such as
		materialism, the breakdown of families, and changes in cultural values fueled
		by mass media.</P> 
	 <P>&#147;It is a mistake to think that just because we are an island we are
		somehow separated from worldwide trends,&#148; said Bishop Hern&aacute;ndez.
		&#147;Some trends might get here a little later than other places, but they get
		here.&#148;</P>

         <font face="Arial" size="2">Juan de Dios Hern&aacute;ndez Ruiz became the auxiliary bishop of Havana
		Jan. 14. The 57-year-old Jesuit priest is a native of Holgu&iacute;n in eastern
		Cuba. &#147;I love this country and I love Jesus Christ and the church,&#148;
		he said. &#147;These are the three loves that define my life.&#148; Below are
		excerpts from an interview with the bishop just days after he took office.</font></P> 
	 <P><font face="Arial" size="2">&#147;It is impossible to explain the Catholic church in Cuba or
		anywhere else from anything other than the perspective of faith. It&#146;s true
		that its temples and its social and educational institutions allow for its
		visible manifestation. But faith as a culture transcends institutional
		elements, and the more profound reality of the church can only be experienced
		through that tool. Faith is the only way to access and fully comprehend the
		mystery -- that is to say, the spirituality -- that is the church.</font></P> 
	 <P><font face="Arial" size="2">&#147;At any given moment, a religious institution anywhere might find
		itself facing direct or indirect forms of repression. But when faith is
		culture, even in Cuba, which has faced enormous problems in holding onto its
		enormous reserve of Christianity, faith endures despite all of these
		difficulties.</font></P> 
	 <P><font face="Arial" size="2">&#147;Without a doubt, religious freedom was directly and sometimes
		violently infringed upon for many years in Cuba. There were times when it was
		very difficult for people to attend church. Thank God, there are fewer such
		problems today: Direct challenges by state institutions to the very right to
		religion have all but disappeared. We are free to publicly express our faith,
		and every diocese today has some kind of newsletter or magazine. This is what
		gives us hope that times are indeed changing.&#148;</font></P>

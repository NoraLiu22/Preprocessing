    <h4>INTRODUCTION TO THIRD WORLD WAR</h4>
    <p>The Gulf War may be termed THIRD WORLD WAR in two senses of this title: First, this war
    aligned the rich North, the rich oil emirates or kingdoms, and some bribed regional
    oligarchies against a poor Third World country. In that sense, the Gulf War was a THIRD
    WORLD WAR by the North against the South. It was massively so perceived throughout the
    Third World South, not only in Arab and Muslim countries but also elsewhere in Asia,
    Africa and Latin America. Masses of people in the Third World manifested their opposition
    to this war and the North, even if it meant taking sides with the dictator Saddam Hussein,
    for whom little love was lost. Indeed, the popular expressions of racism and xenophobia in
    the North also were manifestations of this same perception that this was a war between
    &quot;us&quot; in the North and &quot;them&quot; in the Third World South. </p>
    <p>The second sense of THIRD WORLD WAR is that the Gulf War may dangerously mark the
    brutal beginning of a THIRD WORLD WAR, following upon the First and Second World Wars. Not
    only was the tonnage of bombs dropped on Iraq of world war proportions. The Gulf War and
    the New World Order it was meant to launch signify the renewed recourse by a world wide
    &quot;coalition of allies&quot; to mass destruction of infrastructure and mass
    annihilation of human beings. The allies led by the United States chose to wage a major
    destructive, brutal and unnecessary war and renounced dialogue and negotiation as their
    preferred instrument to settle a relatively minor international dispute. In so doing
    moreover, they clearly signalled their threat to build the New World Order on repeated
    recourse to this same military force and annihilation against any other recalcitrant
    country or peoples -- as long as they are poor, weak, and in the Third World South. </p>
    <p>With the conclusion of the cold war, the Third World [Hot] War is not to be fought
    between East and West, or West and West, but between the North and the South. Since the
    Second World War, West- West wars have been obviated, and the East-West cold war has been
    fought out in regional hot wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, Nicaragua, and other parts of
    the Third World. Now, West-West cold conflicts are also to be transmuted, as in the Gulf
    War against Iraq, into the ever existing North-South conflict and into Third World War at
    the expense of Third World peoples on Third World soil. Of course, the North-South gap and
    conflict itself is also becoming ever acuter. The Gulf War signals that in the New World
    Order the North reserves the right and threat to turn any Old World Order North-South cold
    conflict into a North-South hot war at the expense of Third World people on Southern soil
    at any time of Northern choosing. Therefore, the world is threatened with THE THIRD WORLD
    WAR. </p>
    <p>This essay examines the Gulf War and the New World Order in this global context.
    However, it also concentrates on the political economic motives, actions and their
    consequences of the major actors in the unfolding of this tragic drama. THE major actor in
    the Gulf War for a New World Order certainly was President George Bush. However, he has
    never told the truth about his reasons, actions, or purposes in promoting and fighting the
    Gulf War. Indeed, George Bush deceived the American public and the world already earlier
    on. To go no further, the dominant theme in his election campaign to the American
    presidency was READ MY LIPS!. He promised the American people and in effect the world
    &quot;NO NEW TAXES&quot; and &quot;A KINDER, GENTLER PRESIDENCY.&quot; Instead, what we
    got from President Bush is his New World Order War in the Gulf. Poor American people and
    Poor World! They did not listen when Bush's Democratic Party rival Michael Dukakis
    explicitly warned us all that George Bush was making false promises. The Bush campaign
    also featured promises to be &quot;The Education President&quot; at home and &quot;To Take
    Care of the Environment.&quot; Once elected, President Bush first raised new taxes, which
    will have to rise further with recession and war. Then he neglected education and the
    environment, which will also suffer more for the war. </p>
    <p>President Bush made this war, and in order to make the war he gave us THE BIG LIE both
    about the war and about his NEW WORLD ORDER. Therefore, it takes some inquiry to unravel
    the immediate economic and more underlying geopolitical economic reasons; the economic
    buildup, political escalation, belligerent pursuit and the human and material damages; and
    the domestic and international costs of this Gulf War for New World Order. Finally, we may
    inquire into the resulting place of the United States in this New World Order. The purpose
    here is to contribute to the clarification and answer of these important questions. </p>
    <p>Therefore, this essay concentrates on the actions and responsibility of the Bush
    Administration in the United States in the Gulf War. This essay consolidates, amplifies,
    documents and updates the author's four earlier writings and publications on the Gulf
    crisis and war, which are listed below. One of these earlier essays still included &quot;a
    curse on both your houses&quot; in its title, because then it still seemed important to
    stress and critique the responsibility of both sides to this conflict. However, more
    recently it has become both absolutely and relatively more important to analyze and help
    expose the American Bush administration's much greater [ir]responsibility in the tragic
    unfolding of events. In the meantime also, much more evidence on the same has also become
    publicly available. I draw on the relatively limited amount of this evidence made
    available abroad, primarily through the International Herald Tribune [IHT]. In any case,
    the actions of the United States and its allies carry much more weight and importance than
    those of any country or its leader in the Third World. Therefore, the analysis below
    concentrates on the world shaking actions and consequences of the major actors in this
    drama and on their responsibilities in and significance for the &quot;new world
    order.&quot; </p>
    <h4>FALSE WESTERN PRETEXTS FOR GOING TO WAR IN THE GULF</h4>
    <p>The violation of international law through the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by
    Iraq under the presidency of Saddam Hussein is beyond dispute. However, the allegation
    that the Gulf War was to protect the &quot;principle&quot; of world order, international
    law and the Charter of the United Nations from lawless might-is-right violation is a lie.
    Indeed, this pretext is the height of cynicism, especially by President Bush, but also by
    his Western allies and others who supported him in the United Nations. Many similar
    aggressions and violations of both the UN Charter and UN resolutions have gone without any
    such response, or often even without any notice. Indonesia invaded and ravaged East Timor
    and Irian Jaya with genocide without having the world take hardly any notice. Apartheid in
    South Africa, but less so its continual aggressions against its neighboring Front Line
    States in Southern Africa, led to embargoes by the UN and its members; but no one ever
    suggested going to war against South Africa. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan merited
    condemnation and opposition, albeit of course not by the Security Council; but certainly
    no counter invasion of the Soviet Union. The Iraqi invasion of Iran received, but did not
    merit, de facto political and even military support by the same coalition of allies, which
    then waged war against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. </p>
    <p>Indeed, among the very same states who allied themselves in a coalition to
    &quot;liberate Kuwait&quot; from aggression and occupation by Iraq several engaged in
    similar aggression and still today maintain their military occupation of others'
    territory: Israel invaded and still occupies the Golan Heights, West Bank, and the Gaza
    Strip in violation of UN Resolution 242. Israel also invaded Lebanon and de facto still
    exercises miliary control over southern Lebanon. Syria invaded and still exercises
    military control over parts of northern Lebanon. Turkey invaded Cypress in 1974 and still
    occupies part of it militarily. Morocco invaded and took over the Western Sahara. Only
    recently, the United States waged war on Nicaragua for a decade through the
    &quot;contras,&quot; invaded and still occupies Grenada, and invaded and still exercises
    military occupation over Panama. Thus, the coalition allies included at least a half dozen
    states [not to mention France in Africa and the South Pacific and Britain in the South
    Atlantic] who themselves recently subjected other UN member states to military invasion
    and still occupy them or parts of their territory. This dirty half dozen clearly did not
    &quot;defend Kuwait&quot; to defend the international law that they were and still are
    breaking themselves. Like the other coalition members and demonstrably the mortal enemies
    Syria and the United States, they allied themselves with each other each for their own
    sordid realpolitik reasons. As the foreign minister of Australia, whose hands are not so
    clean either, explained, &quot;the world is littered with examples of acquisition by
    force.&quot; </p>
    <p>Significantly however, hardly anyone except some Latin Americans - not even President
    Hussein and certainly not President Bush - has made the obvious linkage of the Iraqi
    occupation of Kuwait with the American one of Panama. Only eight months before President
    Hussein invaded Kuwait, President Bush himself invaded Panama The US foreign invasion of
    sovereign Panama cost 4,000 to 7,000 lives [far more than the simultaneous domestic
    violence in Romania], used armed brutalization of part of the population, caused wanton
    destruction of property for which no amends have ever been made. Moreover, Panama is still
    &quot;governed&quot; by a &quot;president&quot; and two &quot;vice-presidents&quot;
    solemnly installed by the United States on an American military base and under effective
    US military occupation and rule to this day! </p>
    <p>President Bush's &quot;Just Cause&quot; for his invasion of Panama with 27,000 troops
    to catch one drug trafficker was a cynical lie. So much so that a year later in Panama the
    drug trade remains business as usual (IHT April 20-21, 1991 ), and in the United States
    President Bush's Justice Department has been unable to unearth a single shred of
    documentary evidence to use in court against General Noriega. Indeed, he may never get to
    court, not the least because Noriega himself probably has evidence on George Bush since
    their days of friendly collaboration no so long ago. The real reasons for President Bush's
    invasion of Panama have still not been revealed. Noriega's defense lawyer now claims that
    the real issue in the US-Norigea falling out was not reported drug dealing but Noreiga's
    late 1980s refusal, despite CIA threats, to help the CIA backed contras invade Nicaragua
    (IHT May 17,1991). Another reason for the invasion may have been the need to replace the
    no longer usable bogey of the Soviet evil empire with a new one in the personalized form
    of a narco-terrorist in the Isthmus -- until a better bogey became available in the Gulf.
    However, more material incentives have also been suggested: In the short run, to forestall
    a deal with Japan, which was a threat because of Panama's accession to a majority on the
    Canal Commission on January 1,1990. There is also increasing evidence that a longer run
    reason for the U.S. invasion and continued occupation of Panama is to maintain control
    over the Canal by forestalling the execution of the Carter-Torrijos Treaty. It stipulates
    the American handover of all of the Canal and its &quot;Zone&quot; to Panama on January 1,
    2000. What limit then is there to cynicism when President Bush can now appeal to God,
    morality, and international law to condemn President Hussein's invasion and occupation of
    Kuwait, when he himself did and still does the same in Panama? </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, lying cynicism is not limited to Presidents Hussein or Bush and their
    immediate supporters. No Security Council resolutions were passed, or even proposed, to
    protect President Bush's new world order from his own violation of the sovereignty of
    Panama. On the contrary, President Bush received only acquiescence or even outright
    support for his violation of international law and human right in Panama. So had President
    Reagan when he invaded and occupied sovereign Grenada [which also is still administered by
    the United States]. Indeed, the entire European Community, not to mention the United
    States, also already supported Prime Minister Thatcher when she escalated her war against
    Argentina and its military junta [notwithstanding that she literally torpedoed on the
    ocean all efforts in Lima to defuse the situation and prevent war in the South Atlantic,
    and that she threatened to nuke the Argentine city of Cordoba]. The Malvinas/Falkland War
    was the first major war of all the West against a single Third World country. The latter
    received no support of any kind from any other country in the North, and only moral
    support regardless of political ideology from its regional partners in Latin America.
    Therefore, it cannot be credible that today the same old Western NATO allies -- and now
    the ex Warsaw Pact foes and new allies to boot - appeal to God and justice from their high
    moral horses to condemn another violation of international law and to band together to
    wage war against a Third World country for the same. There must be other -- even more
    cynical? -- reasons at work. </p>
    <h4>IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC REASONS FOR GOING TO WAR</h4>
    <h5>Foreign Oil</h5>
    <p>The most obvious economic reason for the war has been oil. The real price of oil had
    again declined, especially with the renewed decline of the dollar in which oil is priced.
    Iraq had some legitimate demands, both on its own behalf against Kuwait and on behalf of
    other Arab states and oil producers. In pressing these demands by resort to invasion,
    Saddam Hussein threatened some other oil interests, clients of the United States, and the
    success of its &quot;divide et impera&quot; policy. </p>
    <p>President Hussein invaded Kuwait for political economic reasons: to shore up his
    political capital at home and in the region in the face of increased debts from the
    Iraq-Iran War and declining earnings from oil revenues with which to settle these debts.
    Time (August 20) observed that &quot;the uneven distribution of wealth- producing
    resources -- the gap between haves and have-nots -- is fuelling a regional crisis, a
    struggle with severe implications for the entire world's standard of living.&quot; The
    same issue of Time Magazine also quoted an advisor to President Bush: &quot;this has been
    an easy call. Even a dolt understands the principle. We need the oil. It's nice to talk
    about standing up for freedom, but Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are not exactly democracies,
    and if their principal export were oranges...we would have closed Washington down for
    August. There is nothing to waver about here.&quot; Later, placards carried in street
    demonstrations around the world expressed the same still more simply NO BLOOD FOR OIL. </p>
    <p>That world renowned moral authority, Richard Nixon, aptly summed up both the
    recessionary and the oil reason, and to boot he managed to do so under the title
    &quot;Bush Has it Right: America's Commitment in the Gulf Is Moral.&quot; Nixon wrote </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When Senator Bob Dole said we were in the Gulf for oil and Secretary of State James
      Baker said we were there for jobs, they were criticized for justifying our actions on
      purely selfish grounds. We should not apologize for defending our vital economic
      interests. Had America not intervened, an international outlaw would today control more
      than 40 percent of the world's oil....[However] it will not be just a war about oil. It
      will not be a war about a tyrant's cruelty. It will not be a war about democracy. It will
      be a war about peace....That is why our commitment in the Gulf is a highly moral
      enterprise (IHT Jan. 7, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is hardly necessary to recall that before this same Richard Nixon resigned the US
    presidency to evade congressional impeachment for fraud and deceit, he directed a war to
    bomb Vietnam &quot;back into the stone age.&quot; It was said that &quot;we had to destroy
    it to save it.&quot; </p>
    <h5>Domestic Recession</h5>
    <p>Another immediate economic reason for going to war was to counter domestic recession or
    at least its political consequences at home, as Secretary of State Baker suggested.
    Indeed, both presidents Hussein and Bush started this war to manage their own domestic
    political economic problems in the face of a new world economic recession. There was also
    recent precedent for the same. During the last world recession, both General Galtieri in
    Argentina and Prime Minister Thatcher in Britain started and escalated the
    Malvinas/Falklands War in 1982. The reasons was that they both faced political problems at
    home, which were generated by the world economic recession. Only one of them could win the
    war gamble and thereby assure his/her political survival. Significantly, that war already
    pitched the entire West [and its nuclear arsenal] against a single country in the South. </p>
    <p>Why was American reaction against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait so strong? The United
    States went far beyond what most initially considered appropriate, likely or possible,
    indeed beyond what most people deemed desireable before it took place, as we will observe
    below. So why this reaction here and now and not, for instance, when Iraq attacked Iran or
    when Israel invaded Lebanon, not to mention its continued occupation of Arab territories?
    Part of the explanation of course lies in the differences in American interests among
    their clients and enemies. </p>
    <p>However, the timing of this American response abroad also is immediately related to
    economic needs and political conflicts at home. President Bush's failure to deliver on his
    electoral promises of a domestic renewal program were eating into his popularity ratings,
    and the oncoming recession reduced them further. The recession, the growing budget deficit
    and the end of the cold war fed Congressional threats to the Bush-Cheney Pentagon budget.
    President Bush reacted with much historical precedent. We may note that the incumbent
    administration in the United States, whether Republican or Democratic, had already
    escalated incidents or opportunities to gear up the war machine in response to all
    previous recessions since World War II. </p>
    <p>Truman's massive response in the Korean War in 1950 followed postwar demobilization and
    the first recession in 1949, which many feared might replay the depression of the 1930s.
    During the 1953-54 recession, the United States intervened in the military overthrow of
    the constitutionally elected Arbenz government in Guatemala. The 1957-58 recession was
    followed by Eisenhower's intervention in Lebanon in 1958. The 1967 recession was important
    in Germany and Japan and only incipient in the United States; because the latter avoided
    it through President Johnson's massive escalation to war in Vietnam. Yet Vice President
    and Democratic candidate Johnson had run and won his 1964 electoral campaign against the
    Republican Goldwater on the promise against war in Vietnam. The 1968 Vietnamese Tet
    offensive and the 1969-70 recession were followed by renewed American escalation in
    Indochina, including Cambodia. The 1973-75 recession also resulted in further escalation
    of the war in Vietnam. </p>
    <p>The 1979 recession and Democratic President Jimmy Carter initiated the Second Cold War.
    The two track decision to install cruise missiles in Europe and to negotiate with the
    Soviet Union from strength as well as the 3 percent yearly increase in NATO budgets came
    before the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. The unexpected strong
    American response, which was not expected by the Soviets or perhaps anyone else, followed
    not only the invasion but also the 1979 recession. The 1981-82 recession brought on
    Reagan's military Keynesianism and massive arms build up, not to mention his Nicaraguan
    Contras policy and perhaps his over-reaction in Grenada. As already noted above, Margaret
    Thatcher also over- reacted analogously and received a new lease on her political life in
    the Falklands/Malvinas War when economic recession and political demise threatened her
    government in 1982. </p>
    <p>Threats of recession and military budget cuts also prompted President Bush already to
    over-react massively in Panama. Even greater recessionary threats, decline of his
    popularity over the tax/deficit issue, and military budget cuts then drove him to over-
    react again even more against Iraq. Reports in the American press suggest that the
    Democrats have to shelve much of their proposed Congressional &quot;peace dividend&quot;
    cuts to the Pentagon budget. Of course, hardware and logistics for U.S. intervention in
    the Third World will receive an additional boost. </p>
    <h4>WORLD GEOPOLITICAL ECONOMIC REASONS FOR GOING TO WAR IN THE GULF</h4>
    <h5>The World Recession of the 1990s</h5>
    <p>The discussion by the US administration and press about whether the Gulf crisis brought
    on the recession or not is totally turned around; for both the timing and the causation
    were the other way around. For the recession of 1989-1990-19?? began months before Iraq's
    invasion of Kuwait and led first to President Bush's &quot;Just Cause&quot; invasion of
    Panama and then to the Crisis and War in the Gulf. As Richard Nixon noted, even Secretary
    of State Baker let on undiplomatically that the American stance in the Gulf was to
    maintain jobs at home; and The Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers,
    Michael Boskin, was quoted by the International Herald Tribune (Jan. 3, 199l) to say that
    the American economy would have been even worse off if military operations in the Gulf had
    not helped stabilize it. </p>
    <p>The recession began with the renewed cyclical decline in the rate of profits in 1989,
    which continued in 1990. The recession became evident in 1990 -- some time before the Gulf
    Crisis and War. A very small sampling of newspaper headlines and some text [mostly from
    the International Herald Tribune] from 1990 sets the tone: &quot;U.S. Profits: Sign of a
    Slump [for second year in a row],&quot; &quot;1.3% Fall Forecast for U.S. [3.4 % annual
    rate in the last quarter of 1990],&quot; &quot;Amid Signs of a U.S. Recession,
    Bankruptcies Hit a Record,&quot; &quot;U.S. Firms' Debt Service Burden Grows,&quot;
    &quot;U.S. [corporate and municipal] Debt Downgrades Hit a Record in 1990,&quot;
    &quot;Portfolios of U.S. Banks are Shakiest in 15 Years,&quot; &quot;20 Big Banks Head for
    Failure. U.S. Agency Says Many Will Need Bailouts,&quot; &quot;U.S. Deposit Insurance [of
    bank accounts] is 'At a Low',&quot; &quot;1991 Bank Failures Threaten U.S. Fund. Most
    Large Institutions Are on Verge of Insolvency, Congress Study Says,&quot; &quot;This Is a
    Rescue? The S&amp;L bailout is faltering - and the meter keeps running,&quot; &quot;No End
    in Sight. Politicians Hurl blame as the U.S. savings and loan crisis races out of
    control&quot; -- but not only at the S&amp;Ls, and not only in the USA. The recession is
    already world wide: Canada and Australia are in severe recession. &quot;U.K. Slump Worse
    Than Expected.&quot; France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, even Switzerland
    [&quot;bank profits down&quot;] have reduced or negative growth rates. Africa is in
    depression. In Latin America, GNP declined 0.5 per cent and per capita 2.4 per cent in
    1990, on top of a 10 per cent decline in the 1980s. Now it is the turn of Eastern Europe
    with an over all 20 percent economic decline in 1990, and of the Soviet Union. Also
    &quot;China Sees Threats to Growth&quot; and so does India, whom the crisis largely
    bypassed in the 1980s. </p>
    <p>Are Japan and Germany exceptions? Can and will they be the replacement locomotives for
    the world economy during the early 1990s? &quot;Without World Recovery, Bonn [Germany]
    Fears a Slowdown.&quot; &quot;Germany's East: Bleaker Yet.&quot; &quot;Economy Feels
    Strains as Price of Unity Mounts.&quot; &quot;German Trade: No Moscow Miracles
    Foreseen&quot; to restore exports and jobs lost. Bundesbank President Karl Otto P&#148;hl
    declared the economic consequences of German unification a &quot;catastrophe&quot; and
    drove the D-Mark down several cents the next day. </p>
    <p>In Japan, as well as in Korea and Taiwan, growth rates have also declined already. The
    Japanese speculative bubble has burst. &quot;Japan's Big Banks Brace for Bad
    Results.&quot; The stock market declined 40 percent in 1990; real estate prices plummeted;
    and Japanese investors and speculators transferred funds inward from abroad to help them
    cover their losses at home. That is also why in 1990, for the first time since 1986 and
    now that the United States needs it most, the net flow of Japanese capital was out from
    the United States to Japan. The prospects for a severe recession in Japan and the East
    Asian NICs are quite real. Either way, the prospects for economic cooperation instead of
    competition by Japan in the world economy are quite dim. &quot;G-7 Aides Disagree on
    Policy;&quot; &quot;G-7, by Default, Gives Japan Go-Ahead on Loans to China.&quot; If
    Japan primes the pump or steams up its locomotive at all, it is likely to do so in its own
    region in Asia, as Germany would if at all in Europe. </p>
    <p>Thus, the threat that world recession in the early 1990s will be even more severe than
    in the early 1980s is quite real. As I wrote in 1989 about &quot;Blocking the Black Debt
    Hole in the 1990s&quot; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The question is less one of a soft or hard landing than whether the world economy has
      already bottomed out, or whether the next recession will be still deeper once again. This
      is a serious danger, because the next recession threatens to exacerbate all these
      imbalances and to accelerate their resolution by sucking the world economy into the black
      hole of debt (to use the expression of MIT economist Lester Thurow). The accumulation of
      domestic and foreign debt in many parts of the world is likely to inhibit further domestic
      reflationary finance (call it Gramm-Rudman in the United States) to combat recession just
      when it is most needed in the next recession. That would be among other things to
      forestall the bankruptcies of junk bond financed corporations and banks dependent on
      interbank loans. Both US and Japanese monetary policies would be damned if they do and
      damned if they don't.... The continuing world economic crisis is exacerbating the
      accumulated regional and sectoral imbalances especially among the world's major trading
      regions of America, Europe, Japan, and their Third World and Socialist trading partners.
      They will find it ever more difficult to manage the growing conflicts between financial
      debt speculation and real economic productive investment, through the already conflicting
      monetary, fiscal, exchange rate, trade, security and other policies. Therefore, another
      (again more severe?) recession threatens also to spark another (also more acute?) crisis
      within the crisis. More of the same muddling through is likely to become impossible. Any
      possibility of reimposition of the old American dominance (or an alternative Japanese new
      dominance) in a multilateral world economic and financial system or its coordinated
      management by the G7, G5 or G3 is improbable in such a recession. (A, US bomb and Japanese
      yen based Pacific basin political economic consortium is possible but rather unlikely, and
      one including Europe even less likely). The most likely possible alternative resolution
      will therefore be increasingly neo-mercantilist regionalization of the world economy into
      American dollar, Japanese yen and German led European ECU / D mark zones and/or trading
      (and political?) blocs (Frank 1990c). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5>West-West Competition</h5>
    <p>Additional underlying reasons for the belligerent American stance leading to the Gulf
    War was the defense of American economic and geopolitical interests world wide. The
    primary threats to these American interests are competition from Japan and Germany, or
    from a Japanese led Asia and a German led Europe -- all the more so now that the Soviet
    &quot;threat&quot; is virtually eliminated. As we observed, the cold war is over - and
    Japan and German have won! The Reaganomics of the 1980s helped eliminate the Soviet Union
    from the running but at the cost of mortgaging the American economy and even its
    government's budget to the Japanese and the Europeans. The United States is now
    economically dependent on continued capital inflows from its principal economic rivals,
    which the Japanese already began to withdraw. In response to even deeper recession and/or
    with greater deliberation, the Japanese now threaten to pull the financial rug out from
    under the United States and its dollar altogether. At the same time, trade and other
    economic disputes grow ever deeper at various points including the GATT Uruguay rounds.
    Japan was distinctly uncooperative, and Europe refused to budge more than a few percent on
    the issue of agricultural subsidies. The road to &quot;Europe 1992&quot; was made more
    difficult by the 1989-90 events in Eastern Europe and by Britain's intransigent foot
    dragging. </p>
    <p>The July 1990 Houston Summit of the G [Group of] 7 industrial countries confirmed the
    live-and-let-live &quot;Sinatra doctrine&quot;: Each one does it &quot;my way,&quot; and
    the others nod approval, as long as they have no other choice. At that Summit, Prime
    Minister Kaifu of Japan announced a large scale program of loans to China, and Chancellor
    Kohl of Germany a similar state guaranteed loan of 5 billion DM to the Soviet Union.
    President Bush reiterated his &quot;Enterprise for the Americas Initiative&quot; for a
    free trade zone from Alaska to Patagonia [and $ 7 billion remission of debts out of the
    over $ 420 billion!], which he had already hurried to announce a week earlier. In each
    case, the other two listened, acknowledged, and did nothing either to participate or to
    stop it. Thus, they consecrated what the Soviet spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov had in another
    context baptized as &quot;the Sinatra Doctrine.&quot; </p>
    <p>Germany's first priority was and is reunification. The economic and social costs are
    enormous, and they are borne mostly by the people and their government(s). So far private
    industry in the West of Germany has been very slow to invest in the East of Germany - and
    much less even in the East of Europe. How long it will take Germany to get up the steam to
    put its locomotive in motion remains to be seen -- in Central and Eastern Europe. Little
    of this locomotive power is likely to be visible in the world economy elsewhere. On the
    contrary, as an economy that has been very dependent on exports to the world market,
    Germany itself has already suffered from declining export markets due to the recession
    elsewhere in the world economy. </p>
    <p>In June 1990, the former editor of the American foreign policy establishment's Foreign
    Affairs, James Chace, wrote in International Management. Europe's Business Magazine </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>AUF WIEDERSEHEN USA. There will be a European challenge.... Europe has ... turned
      Servan-Schreiber's thesis on its head. Today it is the United States that is fearful of
      Europe's economic strength and worried about its own relative economic
      decline....Approaching 1992...if there are severe economic dislocations or, let us not
      forget, a global recession, there is no telling how the new Europe will react....From this
      prospect arises the even more frightening specter, to Americans at least, of a Fortress
      Europe dominated by great industrial groups that could freeze all competitors out of its
      market. If this should happen, the risks to the United States would be huge.... The
      likelihood that the Europeans will eventually form a pan-European security system of their
      own will further reduce U.S. power and influence.....Washington is almost desperately
      eager to remain in Europe. &quot;The United States should remain a European power in the
      broadest sense, politically, militarily and economically,&quot; said U.S. President Bush
      in a speech last month. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Two months later, Saddam Hussein offered President Bush an opportunity to meet the
    European challenge. </p>
    <h5>Using Military Strength to Compensate for Economic Weakness</h5>
    <p>BRAVO FOR AMERICAN POWER celebrated the &quot;serious&quot; London paper Sunday
    Telegraph (Jan. 20, 1991) in a five column editorial: &quot;bliss is it in this dawn to be
    alive; but to be an old reactionary is very heaven.... Who matter are not the Germans or
    the Japanese or the Russians but the Americans. Happy days are here again.&quot; The same
    paper added farther down the page, &quot;this is not going to be a multi-polar world. If
    there is to be a new world order, it will be based on US military power with Britain
    playing a key role. Saddam's scalp will be its first trophy.&quot; Thus the London
    Telegraph also makes its own the observation of the aptly named American National
    Interest: &quot;The fact [is] that the military power of the United States was the only
    thing capable of mounting an effective riposte - when the economic power of a Japan or a
    Germany was virtually irrelevant.&quot; Since World War II, the United States has not been
    able to use its military might against Japan and Germany; and it can no longer do much for
    them either, now that the Soviet military threat is waning. However, the United States
    still can - indeed without Soviet encumbrance now all the moreso - use its military might
    in and against countries in the Third World. In other words, the Gulf Crisis offered
    President Bush a black golden opportunity to try to redress declining American hegemony
    against its principal economic rivals in Japan and Germany by playing the only - that is
    military - ace he still has up his sleeve. Of course, at the cost of Iraq and the Third
    World, where this war was &quot;played&quot; out. Without exception, all East-West wars
    since 1945 were fought on Third World soil. Now the West-West competition is to be fought
    out in the South as well. </p>
    <h5>East-West, North-South</h5>
    <p>Oft used labels aligned the old world order along East-West and North-South axes and
    conflicts. In recent years, however, the East- West ones have waned while the North-South
    ones have waxed ever more. So have, albeit to a lesser degree, West-West conflicts among
    North America, Western Europe, and East Asia led by Japan. Thus, recent history was marked
    by &quot;Political Ironies in the World Economy&quot; (Frank 1984/1987). Since 1945, world
    economic conditions were shaping international and national politics and social movements.
    In particular, the economic conflicts and opportunities generated by the world economic
    crisis since 1967 would prove more important in shaping international relations and
    domestic policy than the ideological and political cold war between the United States and
    the Soviet Union. Many East-West conflicts were a sham and largely a cover for the always
    real North-South contradictions. None of the 14 &quot;revolutions&quot; in the South since
    1974 was what it appeared to be or would turn out as was hoped or feared. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>These observations among others suggest the further irony that much of the East-West
      conflict, especially between Washington and Moscow, is a smoke screen cover for
      North-South conflicts.... The world economic and technological development that is now
      passing through a crisis of regeneration, is perhaps, again ironically, likely further to
      diminish if not eliminate the importance of the East-West political division of the world
      much more than the North-South economic division, which it is likely to accentuate still
      further (Frank 1984/1987). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Under the title The European Challenge (Frank 1983/84), I also argued that world
    economic conflicts made greater &quot;Pan-European Entente&quot; [as per my subtitle]
    politically both possible and desireable, all state policies and obstacles of political
    blocs and their ideological inclinations notwithstanding. This inefficacy of
    &quot;voluntarist&quot; state policy and politics, especially for &quot;national
    development&quot; in a world economy, was also the basis for the rise to greater
    importance of alternative social movements in the West, South and also in the East (Frank
    and Fuentes 1989,1990). In the meantime, all of these and related analyses and forecasts,
    which seemed unrealistic in the ideological climate of their time, have become hard
    reality. However, these &quot;ironical&quot; turns and consequences are only logical
    repercussions of the changing world economic conditions. Now the cold war is over, and
    Germany and Japan have won! However, the United States still has the military power and
    the political ambitions to try to defend its place in the world order -- now all the more
    so at the expense of the Third World South. </p>
    <h5>Political Economies of Escalation</h5>
    <p>The escalation of the Gulf crisis was marked by three important new departures in
    recent international political economic relations: </p>
    <p>1. The energetic American response in the Gulf was visibly over a political economic
    issue. The issue is oil without any cold war ideological overtones. The conflict about oil
    and the massive American response was barely masked behind appeals to the
    &quot;defense&quot; of small states in international &quot;law.&quot; </p>
    <p>2. This mobilization was entirely against (a part of) the South without any pretense of
    an East-West ideological cover. Popular reaction in the United States - and some physical
    attacks and threats against innocent neighbors - was directed against the Arab bogey. Not
    for nothing are the image of the Arab and of the &quot;terrorist&quot; often identified in
    the popular mind. The end of the cold war and of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact as a
    credible enemy require the legitimation of another target. Actually, much of the
    ostensible East-West conflict had always been a convenient cover for the underlying
    North/West-South conflict. Now, there is little alternative other than to bring that
    North-South conflict out into the open. Private enterprise drug traffic and individual
    terrorism are useful but limited alternative targets. They are better targets if it is
    possible to make a state sponsorship connection, as (wrongly) claimed about Libya. In
    Panama, the ostensible &quot;enemy&quot; was narco-terrorism. The two were combined and
    personalized by General Noriega and served as readily available ideological replacements
    for the no longer operative red menace/ Soviet bogey. Significantly of course, the target
    was also (in) the Third World. It is even more useful now to be able to mobilize for real
    war against a bigger Third World state and its supposed threat. </p>
    <p>3. The third major departure in the Gulf is the near unanimity and alliance in the
    North against the South. The lineup against Iraq from West to East, includes the United
    States, Western and Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, China and Japan, as well as American
    client states and governments whose arms are easily twisted, as in Egypt and Pakistan.
    That new alignment is a major difference, new departure, and ominous threat for the future
    of &quot;international&quot; relations. Time Magazine commented on &quot;the astonishing
    unanimity of purpose.... It is rare that a victim's fortunes are so directly tied to the
    health of the Western economies.&quot; In view of the same, British Prime Minister
    Thatcher commented &quot;I cannot remember a time when we had the world so strongly
    together.&quot; By &quot;world&quot; she means the &quot;North,&quot; which is what
    counts. Yet, as Time quotes a Bush aide who watched his boss calculate, &quot;he knew that
    to be effective, the lineup against Saddam had to be perceived as more than just the rich
    West against a poor Arab.&quot; This lineup was prepared with care and time. </p>
    <h4>ECONOMIC BUILDUP AND POLITICAL ESCALATION OF CRISIS AND WAR IN THE GULF</h4>
    <h5>Public Iraq-Kuwait Disputes and Secret Kuwaiti-US Agreements</h5>
    <p>The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was not an unexpected bolt of lightening out of the blue.
    Its utilization as a pretext by the United States to launch its new world order through
    the most destructive war since World War II appears increasingly as malice aforethought. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Stealing Kuwait was not simple greed or national hatred. Theft on a national scale [of
      what had been Iraqi before the British created Kuwait] had become the only possible access
      for war- devastated Iraq to ... the modern standard of living that Western nations and
      small oil-producing emirates of the Gulf enjoy today as a matter of right.... The strength
      of this almost suicidal drive to emerge from poverty and backwardness ... was the motor
      (Jim Hoagland, IHT March 5). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Iraqi grievances against Kuwait were an old inheritance from colonial times, which was
    newly aggravated by Kuwaiti action and perhaps provocation. The disputed border between
    Iraq and Kuwait was arbitrarily drawn through the old Mesopotamian sand by the British
    before they had to abandon their colonial empire. However, the British deliberately did so
    to deny Kuwait's oil and access to the sea to the populous Iraqis and to reserve them to a
    rich emirate, which would be more subject to Western influence. Indeed, the resulting
    division among Arabs in Iraq and Kuwait was only one example of their division into six
    large and populous but poor countries and six artificially created smaller states with oil
    reserves ruled mostly by emirs. These have scarcely shared their oil derived riches with
    their poor Arab &quot;brothers&quot; and have preferred to use them to flaunt their luxury
    at home and invest their surplus funds abroad in the West. </p>
    <p>Iraq never quite resigned itself to this colonial and neo-colonial arrangement and its
    borders with Kuwait. In particular, Iraq claimed two small off-coast islands, which would
    increase its access to the sea and tanker born exports of its own oil. Moreover, the
    border between Iraq and Kuwait obliged them to share the Rumaila oil field beneath. Iraq
    accused Kuwait of surreptitiously siphoning off increasingly more than its fair share of
    oil from this common field while Iraq was occupied by its war with Iran. This war left
    Iraq undercapitalized and in US $ 30 billion debt to its rich neighbors. Therefore, Iraq
    asked its rich Arab neighbors, including Kuwait, to forgive this debt and supply it with
    another $ 30 billion. They tentatively offered $ 10 billion each, but then reduced their
    offer to an insulting $ 500 million instead. Moreover, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had started
    to add injury to insult by increasing their own production of oil and thereby driving down
    the price of oil on which Kuwait depended to recoup its wartime losses. Long before its
    recourse to the invasion of Kuwait, Iraq repeatedly denounced and demanded relief from all
    these measures, which it regarded as injurious affronts to itself. To no avail. </p>
    <p>On the contrary, information is emerging both quite publicly and less so that the
    overproduction of oil by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to drive the price of oil down was a
    deliberate attempt to weaken Iraq. &quot;The Kuwaiti government was acting aggressively -
    it was economic warfare&quot; according to Henry Schuler, the Director of the energy
    security program at the Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies, which
    has often been linked to the CIA. </p>
    <p>Saddam Hussein and other Iraqis repeatedly complained about this economic warfare
    against them and demanded better and fairer treatment from their Arab neighbors instead.
    To this end, Hussein convoked an Arab summit in Baghdad in May 1990 and complained of
    &quot;economic warfare,&quot; but to no avail. In his Revolution Day speech on July 19,
    President Hussein called the oil price policy by Kuwait and the other Emirates &quot;a
    poisoned dagger&quot; thrust into the back of Iraq, which was left alone as the only real
    defender of Arab interests. </p>
    <p>King Hussein of Jordan was an intermediary in negotiations between Iraq, Kuwait and
    other Arab states. Michael Emery, writing in the New York Village Voice cites King Hussein
    as his source to make the following statements among others: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Parties to the Arab negotiations say the Kuwaitis ... had enthusiastically participated
      in a behind-the-scenes economic campaign inspired by Western intelligence agencies against
      Iraqi interests. The Kuwaities even went so far as to dump oil for less than the agreed
      upon OPEC price ... which undercut the oil revenues essential to cash hungry Baghdad. </p>
      <p>The evidence shows that President George Bush, British prime minister Margaret
      Thatcher, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, and other Arab leaders secretly cooperated on
      a number of occasions, beginning August 1988, to deny Saddam Hussein the economic help he
      demanded for the reconstruction of his nation.... However, Washington and London
      encouraged the Kuwaitis in their intransigent insistence (Village Voice March 5, 1991
      reprinted in Open Magazine Pamphlet Series No. 9 and also cited in International
      Viewpoint, April 15, 1991) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Iraqi foreign ministry has distributed the translation of a supposedly top secret
    report to the Kuwaiti Minister of the Interior by his Director General of State Security.
    It is dated 22 November 1989, informs of a meeting with the Director of the CIA in
    Washington, and reads in part: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We agreed with the American side about the importance of exploiting the deterioration
      of Iraq's economic situation in order to put pressure on the Iraqi government to consent
      to the delimitation of the borders. The CIA offered its own ideas about how these
      pressures might be exercised through extensive cooperation between the CIA and ourselves
      and that the coordination of these activities be established at a high level....The
      American side offers us a private telephone line to facilitate the rapid exchange of
      information (cited in part by Emery ibid.) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Emery also reports on a July 30 meeting between King Hussein and the foreign minister
    of Kuwait, who is the brother of its ruling Emir. Emery notes that &quot;despite Saddam's
    army on their border, the Kuwaitis were in no mood to listen.&quot; Emery asks </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Why were the rulers of this tiny city-state sure of themselves? Apparently, the
      Kuwaities thought the knew something the Iraqis didn't. In their July 30 meeting...
      [Kuwaiti foreign minister] Sheik Sabeh shocked the Jordanian delegation by saying:
      &quot;We are not going to respond to [Iraq].... If they don't like it, let them occupy our
      territory...we are going to bring in the Americans...&quot; (Emery, ibid.). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Kuwaiti Crown Prince had told his senior military officers that they would have to
    hold off any Iraqi invading force for 24 hours and the &quot;American and foreign forces
    would land in Kuwait and expel them&quot; (Emery, ibid.). </p>
    <h5>Setting the American Trap for Hussein</h5>
    <p>&quot;The Americans were determined to go to war from the start,&quot; and Saddam
    Hussein &quot;walked into a trap&quot; according to the former French foreign minister
    Claude Cheysson (IHT March 11). &quot;State Department officials...led Saddam Hussein to
    think he could get away with grabbing Kuwait....Bush and Co. gave him no reason to think
    otherwise&quot; (New York Daily News Sept. 29). The Former White House Press Secretary
    Pierre Salinger has written at length about how this trap was set [but unfortunately I
    have not yet had access to this documentation]. Bits and pieces of the jigsaw puzzle trap
    are also emerging elsewhere, however; and some may be summarily put together here. The
    belatedly publicized July 25 interview between President Hussain and American Ambassador
    April Glaspie is literally only the tip of the largely submerged iceberg of this trap
    setting story. </p>
    <p>Evidence is emerging to suggest that the Persian Gulf war is the result of a long
    process of preparation, much more so than the Tonkin Gulf one in Vietnam. For a decade
    during the Iran-Iraq war, Saddam Hussein's Iraq had enjoyed US and Western military,
    political and economic support, including $ 1.5 billion of sales approved by the U.S.
    government. George Bush had been a key figure in the Reagan Administration's support for
    Iraq. After the conclusion of Iraq's war with Iran and the accession of George Bush to the
    American presidency, US policy towards Iraq became increasingly confusing at best and/or
    the product of a downright Machiavellian strategy to deceive Iraq and set a trap for
    Hussein. </p>
    <p>In March 1990, the &quot;U.S. Bungled Chance to Oust Hussein, Report Says&quot; (IHT
    May 4-5,1991). According to a belated U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff
    report, rebellious Iraqi military officers had sent out feelers asking Washington for
    support for a coup against Saddam Hussein. However, the Bush adminstration rebuffed them,
    and they desisted. </p>
    <p>The [forced?] resignation and the testimony to Congress of former Undersecretary of
    Commerce for Export Administration Dennis Kloske revealed that in April 1990 he
    recommended &quot;at the highest levels&quot; the reduction of high tech sales to Iraq. He
    himself sought to delay these exports by tying them up in red tape to compensate for the
    lack of such action by the Bush administration. Still during the last week of July, the
    Bush administration approved the sale of 3.4 million in computers to Iraq. The day before
    the invasion of Kuwait on August 1, the US approved the sale of $ 695,000 of advanced data
    transmission devices (IHT March 12). As Kloske later testified, &quot;The State Department
    adamantly opposed my position, choosing instead to advocate the maintenance of diplomatic
    relations with Iraq&quot; (IHT, April 11). </p>
    <p>A month later in May 1990, the National Security Council [NSC] submitted a white paper
    to President Bush &quot;in which Iraq and Saddam Hussein are described as 'the optimum
    contenders to replace the Warsaw Pact' as the rationale for continuing cold war ilitary
    spending and for putting an end to the 'peace dividend'.&quot; Yet the same NSC toned down
    an April 30 speech by Vice President Dan Quayle adding &quot;emphasis on Iraq misplaced
    given U.S. policy, other issues&quot; [John Pilger, The New Statesman Feb. 8]. </p>
    <p>At the State Department, Secretary James Baker had promoted John Kelly to Assistant
    Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs. Kelly visited Baghdad in February,
    &quot;the records of which he is desperately trying to deep-six [bury]&quot; (William
    Safire, IHT March 26,1191]. However, it has been revealed that Kelly told President
    Hussein that &quot;President Bush wants good relations with Iraq, relations built on
    confidence and trust.&quot; Moreover, Kelly then rebuked the Voice of America and
    countermanded the Defense Department on statements, which he considered too unfriendly to
    Iraq. On April 26, Kelly testified to Congress that Bush administration policy towards
    Iraq remained the same and praised Saddam Hussein for &quot;talking about a new
    constitution and an expansion of participatory democracy.&quot; Still on July 31, two days
    before the August 2 invasion of Kuwait, Kelly again testified to a Congressional
    sub-committee &quot;we have no defense treaty with any Gulf country.&quot; </p>
    <p>Kelly had sent the same message to President Hussein through the U.S. American
    Ambassador April Glaspie. In the July 25 interview with President Saddam Hussein, she told
    him that &quot;we have no opinion on ...conflicts like your border dispute with Kuwait...I
    have direct instruction from the President... Secretary of State James Baker has directed
    our official spokesman to emphasize this instruction.&quot; &quot;Mr. President [Hussein],
    not only do I want to tell you that President Bush wants better and closer relations with
    Iraq, but also that he wants Iraq to contribute to peace and prosperity in the Near East.
    President Bush is an intelligent man. He is not going to declare economic war against
    Iraq.&quot; In her testimony to Congress, which the State Department deliberately delayed
    until after the end of the war, Ambassador Glaspie was asked &quot;did you ever tell
    Saddam Hussein...if you go across that line into Kuwait, we're going to fight?&quot;
    Ambassador Glaspie replied &quot;No, I did not.&quot; </p>
    <p>In the meantime on July 19, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told the press that the US
    was committed to defend Kuwait if attacked. However, his own press spokesman Pete Williams
    immediately repudiated Cheney's statement as spoken &quot;with some liberty,&quot; and the
    White House told the Defense Secretary that from then on he was to leave making statements
    to itself and the State Department. On July 24, Iraq moved two divisions to the Kuwaiti
    border, and on July 25, the same day as the Hussein-Glaspie interview, a Kuwaiti military
    attache working in the Basra consulate informed the government of Kuwait that Iraq would
    invade on August 2. Two days later the director of the CIA warned President Bush of the
    likelihood of coming invasion. On July 31, &quot;a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst,
    Pat Lang, bluntly warned in a memo that Saddam Hussein intended to invade. Mr. Lang
    intended his memo as 'a thunderclap' to top policy makers ... but it drew virtually no
    reaction&quot; (IHT May 3, 1991 citing Bob Woodward). On August 1, Secretary of State
    Baker told his colleague Soviet Foreign Minister Sheverdnaze, as the latter waited till
    March 1991 in turn to tell Moscow News, that the United States &quot;has proof that
    aggression is possible&quot; by Iraq. Yet, time and again, President Hussein was and
    continued to be reassured and emboldened by the Bush administration and its Department of
    State, as well as by the US Senate minority leader Bob Dole, who also went to visit him.
    Little wonder, that many observers in Washington and elsewhere concluded that the Bush
    Administration [deliberately?] gave Saddam Hussein the green light to invade Kuwait.
    Moreover as the Village Voice (January 22,1991) also revealed, since then US intelligence
    sources also learned from their &quot;assets&quot; in Iraq that President Hussein was
    personally informed of the American reactions, took each to be yet another sign of Bush
    administration acquiescence with his intentions, and then seemed genuinely surprised at
    the very different and belligerent American reaction to his move into Kuwait. </p>
    <p>President Hussein also may have had additional reasons for his move beyond the
    immediate ones of his oil related grievances with Kuwait. The stalemate in his war with
    Iran incited him to try for a realignment of the regional balance of power once again. It
    is useful to recall that Mesopotamia [Iraq], Persia [Iran], and Egypt always, and
    occasionally the Arabian peninsula also, have disputed but never achieved hegemonial
    regional overlordship for long since the Sumerian Sargon tried around 2,500 BC! </p>
    <p>Immanuel Wallerstein (Economic and Political Weekly, April 27, 1991) suggests four
    reason that may have made the time ripe for Hussein to make another move to that effect:
    1. The world debt crisis for which seizing Kuwaiti assets offered some relief at least to
    Iraq; 2. Israel's recent foreclosure of peace talks and increased intransigence with the
    Palestinians, to whom Hussein's move seemed to pose no further loss and might enhance
    their bargaining power; 3. The end of the cold war and the crisis in the Soviet Union
    deprived him of their support but thereby also of American fears of the same; and 4. the
    collapse of the ideology of national development through domestic efforts suggested the
    need for more drastic measures. These included seizing Kuwait first as a bargaining chip,
    and when that failed, then as Iraq's 19th province. The likelihood of much adverse
    response must have seemed remote, particularly in view of the repeated green lights by the
    Bush administration. </p>
    <h5>Springing the Trap on Hussein by Foreclosing any Diplomatic Way Out</h5>
    <p>Between the Iraqi invasion on August 2, 1990 and the start of American bombing on
    January 17, 1991, President Hussein gave clear indications of his willingness to negotiate
    an Iraqi withdrawal on at least six separate occasions. Three times, he unilaterally took
    steps, which could have led to withdrawal. President Hussein made repeated statements
    indicating that he was serious about withdrawal, which would include Iraqi
    &quot;sacrifices&quot; for a negotiated package deal. On more than one occasion, President
    Hussein and his foreign Minister Tariq Azis also told UN Secretary General of their desire
    for a negotiated solution. All these Iraqi and other initiatives came to naught, because
    the American Bush administration wanted and arranged for them to fail. We briefly review
    only some of these initiatives to avoid the Gulf War, which the Bush administration in the
    United States insisted on fighting. </p>
    <p>British Prime Minister Thatcher was in Washington in early August and egged President
    Bush on to take a completely intransigent hard stand to deny Saddam Hussein any step back
    or way out. We should recall that President Hussein himself first claimed he was only
    helping a rival government in Kuwait, which had asked for his help. Only after the first
    still not clear international response, did he take the next steps to complete military
    occupation, then to annexation, and finally to making Kuwait the 19th province of Iraq. In
    the meantime on August 3, the day after the invasion, the inveterate Jordanian mediator
    King Hussein got Saddam Hussein to agree to attend another hastily convened Arab summit on
    August 5 and then to begin to withdraw from Kuwait again on condition that there should be
    no condemnation of Iraq. Nonetheless, under pressure by Washington and London especially
    on Egyptian President Mubarak who received a call from President Bush, by the evening of
    August 3 a majority of the Arab League had already issued a condemnation at the urging of
    Mubarak. He immediately received the remission of the US $ 7 billion Egypt owed the United
    States. It was a deliberate and ultimately successful drive to scuttle all attempts at a
    negotiated diplomatic settlement of the Iraqi claims, which many people even in Washington
    considered reasonable and negotiable. </p>
    <p>US troops &quot;to defend Saudi Arabia&quot; arrived there on August 7, after several
    days delay. However this delay was only necessary to overcome the resistance thereto of
    the Saudi government who felt no danger of any possible attack by Iraq. It appears that
    the Pentagon then duped the Saudis with allegations that US satellite pictures showed
    Iraqi troops massing on the Saudi border ready to invade. Later Soviet satellite pictures
    examined by American exports showed Iraqi troops in Kuwait that numbered not &quot;even 20
    percent the size the [US] administration claimed. We don't see any congregations of tanks,
    or troop concentrations. The main Kuwait air base appears deserted&quot; (St. Petersburg
    Florida Times cited in War Report No. 6/7, March 23, 1991). </p>
    <p>However, Emery comments again </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>But Saddam's intentions were actually less critical at this juncture than Western
      intentions. In another conversation King Hussein had around this time, with then prime
      minister Margaret Thatcher, the Iron Lady let it slip that &quot;troops were halfway to
      their destination before the request came for them to come [International Viewpoint April
      15, 1991, p. 21]. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Indeed, Iraq sent another proposal to negotiate, which was received on August 9 in
    Washington. The next day, the NSC recommended its rejection as &quot;already moving
    against [our] policy.&quot; Former CIA director Richard Helms tried to find consideration
    for the Iraqi initiative, which a State Department Middle East staffer called both
    &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;negotiable.&quot; However, it was not so considered by the
    Bush administration, where Helms found no one and &quot;nothing in this that interested
    the US government.&quot; On August 12, Iraq again proposed its own withdrawal from Kuwait
    linked to the withdrawal from their occupied territories by Syria and Israel. The US, of
    course, rejected all &quot;linkage,&quot; and Iraq then dropped this negotiating demand
    according to Yasser Arafat. Two weeks later, Iraq made still another offer of withdrawal
    linked to some settlement of its old demands about the two islands, the Rumaila oil field,
    and oil production. The offer reached the Bush administration on August 23 but was
    rejected out of hand. Indeed, as the New York Times diplomatic correspondent noted on
    August 22, any and all such Iraqi initiatives with &quot;a few token gains for
    Iraq...[like] a Kuwaiti island or minor border adjustments&quot; had to be blocked lest
    they might &quot;defuse the crisis.&quot; </p>
    <p>Therefore also, Iraq's &quot;serious prenegotiation position&quot; was again dismissed
    by the United States on January 2, 1991. The US and UK also threatened to veto the French
    proposal on January 14 to avert the start of bombing after the January 15 UN deadline for
    Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The February 15 Iraqi offer to withdraw was again dismissed
    as &quot;linked&quot; to the Israeli-Palestine problem. The February 20-22 Soviet
    initiative to preclude the ground war was rejected, etc. Indeed countless further Iraqi,
    Irani, Jordanian, Algerian, French, Soviet, and other initiatives, including those by the
    UN Secretary General, to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the crisis had to be and were
    effectively blocked by the Bush administration. It wanted and planned its NEW WORLD ORDER
    WAR instead. Far from &quot;going an extra mile for peace,&quot; President Bush
    deliberately deceived one and all with his and Secretary Baker's &quot;negotiations&quot;
    instead to camouflage his own war plan, to be reviewed below. </p>
    <p>The Jordanian King Hussein remarked &quot;I've been convinced for a while that there
    was no effort to dialogue, there was no effort to reach for a diplomatic solution, and
    there was preparation from the word go for war&quot; (Emery, ibid.) </p>
    <h5>Planning Mr. Bush's War</h5>
    <blockquote>
      <p>According to a reconstruction of major internal deliberations and decisions by
      President George Bush and his senior advisors ... offensive military planning began in
      earnest in September, and on Oct. 30, a week before congressional elections, Mr. Bush
      secretly approved a timetable for launching an air war against Iraq in mid-January and a
      large-scale ground offensive late in February that would strike deep into Iraqi territory
      to encircle President Saddam Hussein's army....General Schwarzkopf had introduced the
      concept of offense from the very beginning. ... The dimension of the planned military
      buildup were closely held by Mr. Bush and his inner circle.... The plan required almost
      doubling the 200,000 U.S. forces in the Gulf.... That critical decision increased U.S.
      troops from 230,000 to more than 500,000.... Mr. Bush showed no hesitation in making the
      decision to increase troop strength, but decided to keep it secret until Nov. 8. Why?
      'Nov. 8 was a very important date because it was after Nov. 6' a White House official
      said, referring to the election. ... In the two hour meeting [on October 30], Mr. Bush
      made two fundamental decisions: first, to set in motion the machinery for a midwinter war
      against the Iraqi Army and, second, to win a UN mandate for that war. To that end, he
      dispatched Mr. Baker on a round-the-world tour to round up support for a Security Council
      resolution authorizing the use of force&quot; ( Thomas Friedman and Patrick Tyler, IHT
      March 4, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Yet two days after this important war plan meeting, on November 1 &quot;Bush Denies He
    Prepares U.S. For a Gulf War. Says He Wants to Refocus Attention on Hostage Plight&quot;
    (IHT Nov. 2, 1990). Later President Bush would repeat again and again that &quot;no one
    wanted war less than I did.&quot; But did he ever tell the truth? </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Mr. Bush's decision to use military power was opposed by a bewilderingly mixed bag of
      radical Democrats, moderate and conservative Democrats, conservative Republicans and
      Republican right-wingers. The strongest intellectual cases against going beyond sanctions
      were made by Republocrats like Zbigniew Brzeznski, James Schlesinger and Paul Nitze. All
      are staunch conservatives; all are renowned advocates of a muscular U.S. national security
      policy. Then there was Edward Luttwack, the mother of all conservative strategists ...
      [and] Pat Buchanon. </p>
      <p>Eight of nine recent secretaries of defense favored staying with sanctions. This group
      included none other than [President Reagan's Secretary of Defense] Casper Weinberger. Two
      recent chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Crowe and General David
      Jones, were even more reluctant to use force than Mr. Weinberger. This unique brew of Bush
      critics was joined by probably 90 percent of American and European experts on Arab
      affairs&quot; [Leslie Gelb, IHT March 11, 1991]. </p>
      <p>This is becoming one man's war. It is George Bush's War; the only thing that matters is
      what he thinks. In Washington, people who know Mr. Bush say he is a man obsessed. There is
      no point in arguing with him about this matter, but men very close to the president say
      privately that anyone who tries to disagree is risking access and position.... What does
      the President want? More war, less talk. As commander-in-chief, he is operating like a
      medieval king. This chief seems to be in command alone, with technical advice from his
      military leaders&quot; [Richard Reeves IHT Feb. 26, 1991 my emphasis, AGF]. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In this context, it is even more revealing then to find from Bob Woodward's later
    expose that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>last fall, General Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had serious
      reservations about the Bush administration's shift toward an offensive military strategy
      in the Gulf and repeatedly suggested &quot;containment&quot; of Iraq...short of war.... He
      finally raised the issue with Mr. Bush.... Mr, Bush, according to Mr. Woodward's account,
      answered &quot;I don't think there's time politically for that strategy.&quot; The book
      does not elaborate on the president's political considerations. After that meeting,
      General Powell felt he had gone as far as he could (IHT May 3, 1991) -- </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>without, perhaps, risking his access and position! </p>
    <p>The ultraconservative American columnist Charles Krauthammer notes in the IHT, March 5,
    1991: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Remember how roundly, and correctly, Mr. Bush was criticized for being unable to
      articulate the justness of the cause.... So he did it, as they say in the Middle East, by
      creating facts. Four times since Aug. 2 he made unilateral decisions that were bold and
      generally unpopular. Yet each action reshaped the debate.... Fact 1, Aug. 7: the initial
      U.S. troop deployment ... found 56 percent [of polled Americans] opposed. Announcement of
      the deployment, framed as a defense of Saudi Arabia, drew immediate, 81 percent
      approval.... </p>
      <p>Fact 2, Nov. 8: doubling the ground troops. That put the United States on a war footing
      and created a great wave of Democratic opposition. But there was little the Democrats
      could do. Mr. Bush had used his power as commander in chief to create a political fact....
      Fact 3, the launching of the war itself. But here, too, Mr. Bush had constrained the
      debate with more facts, in this case the already established United Nations deadline....
      Having prepared the battlefield, as the military briefers like to say, Mr. Bush won. By a
      hair, but he won. Then Fact 4, the ground war.... Ten days before the ground war, the
      CBS/New York Times Poll found only 11 percent of Americans in favor of launching one. When
      asked again after the ground war started, 75 percent approved.... My point is merely to
      note the magnitude of his political achievement and the most unusual way in which he did
      it: not with language but with action [Charles Krauthammer, IHT March 5, 1991]. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>FIGHTING AND LYING TO WIN THE WAR</h4>
    <p>Two propaganda blitzes dominated the war: one was that it was valiantly waged against
    &quot;the world's fourth largest army&quot; with a highly trained &quot;elite Republican
    Guard.&quot; The other one was that therefore the coalition forces had to put on history's
    first high tech &quot;Nitendo&quot; like electronic war with &quot;smart bombs&quot; - at
    least curtesy of US and UK military command video taped briefings for CNN and other TV
    networks around the world. Hardly anyone then noticed that these two features of the war
    were mutually contradictory in principle, and empirically false in practice. </p>
    <p>However, former French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson declared </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I categorically reject notions about avoiding unnecessary damage. The allied goal of
      annihilating Iraq's economy was bound to involve civilian casualties.... 200,000 - a
      massacre, with a terrifying impact.... Why don't you ask why the air war lasted 40 days
      instead of the 15 as planned&quot; (IHT March 11, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Only after it was all over, did a bit of the truth emerge about what finally the
    International Herald Tribune headlined &quot;Desert Mirages: In the War, Things Weren't
    Always What they Seemed. U.S. Overestimated Size and Ability of Iraq's Armed Forces.&quot;
    It did so deliberately to help justify the carpet and terror bombing of both the military
    and civilian &quot;assets&quot; of this Third World country with a population of only 17
    million souls. The Pentagon presented sanitized images of a new kind of high tech war
    between machines, not men. We saw videos of outgoing Patriot[ic] American missiles
    impacting on incoming Iraqi Scud missiles. However, we only learned later in the war that
    the Patriots only hit the Scud propulsors and did not destroy their warheads, which still
    hit buildings and killed people. We also were not shown that both missiles fell back to
    the ground to cause damage. Indeed only on April 18 did the IHT reveal that &quot;the
    Patriot may have caused as much damage as it prevented.&quot; </p>
    <p>The military commands also released many videos of precision guided smart bombs taking
    out hard targets in Iraq. However, they neglected to show the that these bombs still were
    not smart enough not to miss 10 percent of their targets. Still less did they mention that
    the smart bombs accounted for only 7 per cent of the tonnage dropped. Of these, the 3
    percent of the total dropped by the new Stealth bombers accounted for 40 percent of the
    target hits, which included roads, bridges, power plants, irrigation works -- indeed
    &quot;the works.&quot; The New York Times editorialized a bit late on March 25,1991 [IHT
    edition] </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The bulk of the damage found by the UN team was not accidental or
      &quot;collateral,&quot; but the intended consequence of the successful air campaign to
      destroy Iraq's war machine by attacking its industrial base and urban infrastructure. The
      findings raise questions about how much of that bombing was needed, or justified. That
      debate will go on.... </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Times and other &quot;responsible&quot; media, however, did precious little to
    start the debate before or during that bombing, when it should have been avoided, limited
    or stopped. When the American targeters hit first the only powdered milk and infant
    formula factory in the country and then a civilian air raid bunker / shelter, the Pentagon
    insisted that they had correctly hit military targets. CNN and its Peter Arnett was
    hounded as a traitor to the cause for sowing doubts after having loyally already aired
    hundreds of hours of war propaganda. In the pot calling the kettle black, the US
    Commanding General Schwarzkopf said &quot;I did resent CNN aiding and abetting an enemy
    who was violating the Geneva Convention&quot; (IHT March 28, 1991). </p>
    <p>Nonetheless it was later revealed that only 60 percent of the laser guided bombs hit
    their intended targets and the other 40 percent missed (Boston Globe Jan. 29, 1991).
    Moreover, we may ask what happened to the 97 percent of bombs that were not from Stealths
    or the 93 percent of the bombs which were not smart enough to get on TV? Answer: 75
    percent of them missed their assigned targets and did only &quot;collateral&quot; damage.
    In English, they carpet bombed and terrorized both the civilian population and its
    conscripted sons in the Iraqi army. Indeed, that was of course the deliberate purpose of
    using squadrons of Vietnam age B52s and their notoriously inaccurate high altitude bomb
    runs. Indeed, some bombs were so big that they would not fit into the B52s and had to be
    carried in and shoved out of even bigger transport planes. </p>
    <p>The United States again used Vietnam fame napalm and cluster &quot;anti-
    personnel&quot; [not anti- person/s?] bombs and fuel explosion bombs. These bombs suck
    oxygen out of their target area and wantonly asphyxiate their victims of mass destruction,
    if they did not kill them through the concussion waves of their explosion. The Los Angeles
    Times (Feb. 24, 1991) also reported on the first wartime use of more &quot;efficient&quot;
    new anti-personnel weapons: &quot;Improved conventional munitions [ICM] can kill four
    times as many soldiers.&quot; Adam and Bouncing Betty bombs bounce off the ground to
    detonate at the more lethal groin level. The Beehive is &quot;perhaps the ultimate concept
    in improved fragmentation...[and] spins at high velocity, spitting out 8,000 flechettes --
    tiny darts with razor edges capable of causing deep wounds.&quot; The fragments of white
    phosphorous howitzer shells &quot;can continue to burn hours after they have penetrated a
    soldier's body, creating deep lesions.&quot; According to the propaganda, the
    &quot;Hitler&quot; Hussein had and threatened to use fuel explosive and chemical
    &quot;poor man's atom bombs.&quot; However, Iraq never used any such weapons. The
    Americans did not threaten. They not only used their tried and true old napalm and other
    anti- personnel weapons. The Americans also used their first opportunity, of course in the
    Third World, to try out their new weapons of mass destruction and annihilation on their
    poor defenseless Iraqi victims. The Iraqis never fought back. Except for the Western
    propaganda value scud missiles, the Iraqis were never reported to have even tried to drop
    a single bomb or shell on allied troop formations. </p>
    <p>The United States also violated United Nations International Energy Commission
    regulations to which it had agreed not to bomb nuclear facilities, because of the danger
    of uncontrollable contamination. Despite this ban and danger, American bombs were dropped
    on Iraqi nuclear facilities anyway. &quot;In one of these cases, the bombardment resulted
    in what Iraq described as 'radiation contamination of the region'.... Thousands of Iraqi
    weapons have been described by Baghdad as buried beneath the contaminated debris of Iraqi
    storage sites and production factories&quot; (IHT May 2, 1991). Contrary to Allied
    assurances as well, bombs also damaged ancient archeological treasures from Sumerian and
    Assyrian times (IHT May 6, 1991). </p>
    <h4>HUMAN AND MATERIAL WAR DAMAGES AND COSTS</h4>
    <h5>The Casualties of Direct Hits and &quot;Collateral Damage&quot;</h5>
    <p>No one knows, or probably ever will know, the resulting number of Iraqi casualties in
    an unnecessary war that could and should have been avoided. The world's &quot;fourth
    largest army&quot; from a population less than 50 percent bigger than New York City had
    been decimated without any means of self defense from the air before the long heralded but
    only 100 hour allied long ground offensive even started. Only after the war, several press
    sources repeatedly reported American military and CIA estimates between 100,000 and
    250,000 Iraqi primarily military dead. In his televised interview with David Frost, the
    American commanding general Norman Schwarzkopf referred to &quot;50,000 or 100,000 0r
    150,000 or whatever of them to be killed.&quot; A Saudi military commander told CNN of
    100,000 Iraqi troops dead and 200,000 wounded. A French military intelligence source told
    the Nouvelle Observateur that 200,000 were killed. The Muslim Institute referred to
    &quot;up to 500,000 Iraqi civilians killed or injured by Allied bombs&quot; in the April
    12 IHT. The eleventh hour or last minute destruction of the two convoys, one 38 Km long
    with 5000 vehicles, retreating out of Kuwait, whose grisly remains were televised around
    the world, cost the totally unnecessary and unjustifiable death of further countless
    thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians, as well as of Kuwaiti hostages. Pilots later
    said that the retreating Iraqis were &quot;basically just sitting ducks&quot; and &quot;it
    was like shooting fish in a barrel&quot; (Washington Post Feb. 27, 1991). The British
    Independent (Feb. 28, 1991) fond it &quot;sickening to witness a routed army being shot in
    the back.&quot; Otherwise, hardly any protest was murmured, and even that was rejected by
    on high. </p>
    <p>At war's end in Iraq, a United Nations commission of inquiry found a country in
    &quot;near apocalyptic&quot; conditions of catastrophe with its economy, society and
    people bombed back into the pre-industrial age. The civilian economic infrastructure had
    been deliberately destroyed. There is no more electric power to treat urban sewage, to
    provide drinking water or to irrigate agricultural land. US President Bush wants &quot;not
    one dime&quot; spent on Iraqi reconstruction and, instead, had the Security Council adopt
    a cease fire resolution to force poor Iraq to use some of its future oil earnings to pay
    for the reconstruction of rich Kuwait. The Emirate, in turn, has reserved and assigned
    over 70 percent of its reconstruction contracts for American companies like the Bethel
    construction company, which sacrificed itself to supply the Secretaries of State and
    Defense to the previous administration ! </p>
    <p>That is, &quot;The New Way of War is to Bomb Now and Kill Later,&quot; as the April 17,
    1991 IHT headlines a column in the Washington Post by the vice president of the World
    Resources Institute, Jessica Mathews. As a direct result of carpet bombing Iraq's
    infrastructure back into a pre-industrial age </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>the International Committee of the Red Cross, which normally expresses itself in the
      most understated language it can devise, warned last week of the seeds of a &quot;public
      health catastrophe of immense proportions.&quot; It was referring not to the plight of the
      1.5 million Kurds but to that of the other 14 million Iraqis. The principal threat is
      contaminated water and lack of sanitation.... Dr. Jack H. Geiger, president of Physicians
      for Human Rights, who has just returned from Iraq, says he would not be surprised if the
      nationwide toll may soon reach &quot;many tens of thousands.&quot; ... The [UN] secretary
      general's mission expects &quot;a catastrophe...at any time.&quot; </p>
      <p>Food is scarce....The June harvest is questionable, with no electricity to run
      irrigation pumps and no gasoline for harvesting combines. Food now available cannot be
      stored because of lack of refrigeration. Seeds for next season's crop were destroyed.
      Famine is in imminent prospect.... </p>
      <p>The extent of present and anticipated human suffering demands some clear answers to
      these questions. With whom were the allied at war, Saddam Hussein or all Iraqis? If not
      all Iraqis, which?... How far does America's and other coalition members' responsibility
      extend for Iraqi's suffering? If Iraq cannot pay for what its people need while also
      paying reparations, what should be done? Finally, unavoidably: Was it worth it? </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In answer, Gulf War US Commander in Chief General &quot;Stormin&quot; Norman
    Schwarzkopf declared </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I have a great feeling of a great victory. Anyone who dares even imply that we did not
      achieve a great victory obviously doesn't know what the hell he is talking about [IHT
      April 13- 14] </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The same General Schwarzkopf had also declared that if there ever were any conflict
    between his ethics and his duty, he would of course chose his ethics above his duty. ln
    1983 already, he valiantly used 6,000 troops to conquer mighty Grenada and its unarmed
    Cuban construction workers at the cost of still untold casualties. Early on in the Gulf
    conflict, he had given public assurances that anyone evacuating Kuwait would of course be
    guaranteed safe passage, for otherwise it would be unreasonable to expect them to leave.
    Then, he killed every last member of the 5,000 vehicle retreating convoy. Now, General
    Schwarzkopf also says &quot;never say never&quot; to the well earned proposals of a
    nomination to the presidency of the United States. In the meantime, Stormin Norman intends
    to retire with &quot;multimillion dollar book offers&quot; for his memoirs and/or a
    multimedia book and film deal [IHT 13-14 April]. For the victory euphoria among some
    people in the United States seems to know no bounds. </p>
    <p>So it was certainly &quot;worth it&quot; for them, since President Bush aptly noted
    that &quot;By God, we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all.&quot; Vietnam had
    been &quot;bombed back into the stone age,&quot; but the humiliated Americans were forced
    to withdraw in defeat anyway. Now the &quot;great victory&quot; over Iraq is the corner
    stone of America's &quot;new world order.&quot; </p>
    <h5>Other Human Costs</h5>
    <p>There were already been many other important casualties even before the first shot was
    fired: The millions of refugees in the Gulf region; the millions of people who lost
    sources of their livelihood from the occupation of Kuwait and the embargo against Iraq.
    The many Third World countries from which the guest workers came lost the remittances of
    foreign exchange from these workers. Moreover, they now return home penniless to augment
    the masses of the unemployed. The price of petroleum temporarily skyrocketed for the old
    Third World countries in the South and the new Third World countries in Eastern Europe.
    Hundreds of millions of people around the world saw their most urgent problems [like
    renewed famine in Africa] even more neglected by the attention, which was focussed on the
    Gulf. All of these suffer from President Hussein's occupation of Kuwait and President
    Bush's escalation of the same into a major war. Post war refugees by the millions were
    also forseeable. As in all occupation and war, the rape of women multiplied. All of these
    casualties were bound to multiply again in the course of the war itself and even after the
    &quot;liberation&quot; of Kuwait. Yet only some of these costs and casualties merited
    little concern at best, and then only when it was necessary in order to tie some regional
    governments into the alliance, like Turkey and Syria, or maintain them neutral, like
    Jordan and Iran. Most of these momentous problems and their literally untold costs to
    countless millions of people have received no, or virtually no, attention from the
    &quot;responsible&quot; presidents, their allied prime ministers, their governments, the
    United Nations, or the mostly warmongering media. The direct financial costs of the war to
    the coalition allies, from which the United States seems to be making a net profit, are
    better considered in the discussion below of the American New World Order. </p>
    <h5>Ecological Costs</h5>
    <p>The Ecological costs of the war have been enormous, but so has been their western
    propaganda use to extend and intensify the war. That way, the ecological costs were
    increased still further. The oil spills in the Gulf were blamed on the Iraqis by the
    Pentagon. The media showed heart rendering images of oil stricken birds. As it turned out,
    these pictures were taken during earlier oil spills elsewhere. The purpose, of course, was
    to whip up even more anti-Hussein sentiment to justify the escalation of the war. After
    all the propaganda, the ecological damage turned out to be less than advertised. Wildlife
    conservationists now estimate that 1/2 of 1 percent of the birds in the area were
    affected. The percentage of Iraqi people killed was very much higher, but their pictures
    did not go around the world. As to the oil slicks themselves, Claude-Marie Vadrot of the
    Paris Journal de Dimanche (Feb. 3) writes &quot;none of the existing slick in the Gulf
    have resulted from voluntary action or piracy, and four out of five are the responsibility
    of allied forces.&quot; The first one was from the January 19 allied bombardment of three
    oil tankers. The second one from the January 20 bombing by French and British planes. The
    third one can be attributed to Iraqi bombardment. The fourth is due to allied bombardment
    of Al Ahmadi, and the fifth oil spill if from the bombing of Boubyane Island by British
    planes. </p>
    <p>The 500 Kuwaiti burning oil wells were indeed set afire by the Iraqis, who had
    announced from the very beginning that they would have to use this measure. It was one of
    the few available to them to defend themselves from superior force in general and from
    threatened amphibious attacks across the Gulf waters in particular. Moreover, having been
    incited into this war by Kuwaiti oil competition and duplicity, Iraq now assured itself of
    a long respite from this competition by setting fire to the Iraqi oil wells. The resulting
    man-made environmental damage from smoke is unprecedented, at least in its regional
    impact. However, this damage also is much less than was advertised, and it has been noted
    that the same oil would eventually be burned one way or another somewhere else anyway.
    Less has been said of the ravages to the desert environment by over a million troops with
    their heavy equipment and its destruction. However, the responsibility for the wanton
    disregard of all this environmental threat and damage must be shared if not carried by the
    coalition allies and their American leadership, who pushed ahead with their war plans in
    total disregard of this problem. So much for the promises and commitment of President Bush
    and others to safeguard the environmental future of wo/mankind. </p>
    <h4>POLITICAL COSTS OF THE GULF WAR: VIOLATION OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME</h4>
    <p>The Gulf War fought against a ruthless dictator in the South by the great democracies
    in the West violated or subverted the most important bases and institutions of democracy.
    The United States Congress, other Parliaments, and the will of the vast majority of the
    people in the West were violated. Freedom of the Press was actively censored, and the Free
    Press guardian of democracy self- censured itself. As much by omission as by commission,
    the media deliberately misled the public. Participant democracy in civil society and its
    organization through social movements were bypassed and neutralized or sterilized. On the
    other hand, racism and chauvinism flourished and were used to aid and abet the war effort
    on the home front. The Gulf War was falsely fought in the name of &quot;democracy.&quot;
    The war witnessed one of the sorriest days for real democracy in the West, not to mention
    the newly democratic East. </p>
    <h5>Setting Up and Blackmailing Congress</h5>
    <p>Another major institutional casualties of the Gulf War were the American Congress and
    other parliaments. The constitutional mandate of Congress to keep the President in check
    and balance, and especially to exercise its authority to declare war for good cause were
    subverted. President Bush skillfully manuevered Congress with deceit and blackmail
    reminiscent of and functionally analogous to the Tonkin Gulf affair. [That was when
    President Johnson faked a Vietnamese attack in the Tonkin Gulf to deceive Congress into
    authorizing escalation in Vietnam in 1964]. All through the autumn, the American Congress
    and public were against a US war in the Gulf. However, President Bush manuevered and
    blackmailed Congress to back him up to go to War in the Gulf by adept and deceitful
    timing. </p>
    <p>Congress would surely have refused to vote Mr. Bush war powers in November or perhaps
    even in December. That is surely also why President Bush did not send his war resolution
    to Congress before he had crossed so many Rubicons, that Congress could hardly deny its
    support to the American men and women, whom President Bush had sent to the battle front. A
    crucial step by President Bush was to double the number of troops in Saudi Arabia by
    bringing in 200,000 more American NATO troops from Germany in November. He brought them,
    not as initially announced to rotate them with, but now to add them to, those already
    there. Thereby also, the mission of the American troops was changed from the supposed
    defense of Saudi Arabia against a possible attack by Iraq to the &quot;liberation&quot; of
    Kuwait through the planned American attack of Iraq itself and to the defeat of its
    military forces. In view of this commitment by President Bush, the ever astute Henry
    Kissinger then observed that any withdrawal without victory now &quot;would lead to a
    collapse of American credibility, not only in the area but in most parts of the
    world&quot; (quoted in the International Herald Tribune Jan. 17, 1991). </p>
    <p>These far reaching decisions were made before the November 6 American congressional
    elections. However, they were deliberately withheld from the public and Congress before
    the elections and only implemented thereafter. The same day of the above cited eventful
    meeting at the White House, </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>on Oct. 30, Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker briefed congressional leaders
      but said nothing explicit about the president's war policy. Later that day Mr. Bush
      doubled U.S. troop levels -- a decision not disclosed to the public until the election was
      past (New York Times editorial &quot;Bush the Warrior&quot; in IHT May 6,1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Neither the American public, nor the American Congress, would have agreed to this
    deliberate escalation towards war by President Bush if they had been given a choice. That
    is why President Bush gave them no choice, but instead deceived them and pursued his
    covert policy of faits accomplis. </p>
    <p>Then, President Bush deliberately delayed seeking authorization of his war plans from
    Congress until January, because he knew he would be refused until he could put together a
    strong enough foreign hand to finesse and blackmail an ever patriotic domestic Congress.
    In the meantime, Bush and Baker used diplomacy to build up an international coalition for
    the Gulf. Especially crucial was UN Resolution 678 to set a January 15 deadline for Iraq
    and for Bush to use the over half a million armed forces he had sent to the Gulf. Some
    American commentators remarked on the irony that President Bush was able to get the
    authorization for going to war in the Gulf from the United Nations, which he was unable to
    get from his own American Congress. Then, of course, he used the one in his faits
    accomplis policy to get the other as well. </p>
    <p>Thus, President Bush used the powers of his office first to overcome congressional and
    popular opposition, then to get reluctant approval, and finally to achieve jingoistic
    enthusiasm for his war. President Bush had already made over 400,000 American troops ready
    for battle in the Gulf, which in itself exerted pressure on Congress now to accept this
    fait accompli and to authorize their use. Moreover, President Bush threatened to give the
    order to send them into war with or without the approval of Congress, to whom the
    Constitution reserves the right to declare war [which it never did in Vietnam]. Even so,
    in its pre-deadline resolution nearly half the Senate still dared to oppose or at least to
    delay the use of these troops for war. However, President Bush's war resolution passed,
    the January 15 UN deadline came and went; and the US Commander in Chief gave the order to
    fire. Then, of course, Congress - the Senate voted 98-0 - and the American people were
    faced with President Bush's [so far] final fait accompli, which now oblige them to rally
    around their troops, their flag and their President. </p>
    <p>President Bush's strategy to blackmail the American Congress was particularly effective
    through its use at the eleventh hour before going to war. Another conservative commentator
    asks us to </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>recall the circumstances of the key congressional vote on Jan. 12, four days before Mr.
      Bush launched the air war.... Some number of legislators - quite possibly the number that
      tipped the balance - made their decision not on the basis that war had become necessary
      and feasible. No,...they felt that a vote to authorize force offered the only chance
      remaining to squeeze Saddam into backing off. In short, whatever the president and his
      advisors may have thought, the vote in Congress was finally carried not by those who had
      determined that war was inevitable and who were ready for it, but by those that hoped that
      war was still avoidable. At that moment, moreover, there was little awareness evident
      anywhere in Congress that the United States and its allies were going to wage the sort of
      fantastic high-intensity military campaign, air and ground, that materialized&quot;
      (Stephen Rosenfeld IHT March 11, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus, President Bush won. The American Congress was denied its constitutional mandate
    to exercise checks and balances on the President, and especially on his ability to wage
    war. Through all this deceit by President Bush, the two major institutional safeguards
    against war, the United Nations and the United States Congress, became major casualties of
    President Bush and those who supported him before the first shot was even fired in the
    Gulf War. </p>
    <p>Other parliaments in the West were also bypassed and/or bamboozled into supporting and
    paying for a war whose real reason and purpose was never explained to them or their voter
    constituencies. The easiest task was perhaps in Britain, where all substantive discussion
    of the matter in the House of Commons was avoided, and attention was focussed on the
    change of parliamentary and government leadership. President Bush's most enthusiastic
    foreign support did come from Britain, first under the leadership of Prime Minister
    Margaret Thatcher and then under that of her successor John Major. The London Telegraph
    (January 20,1991) offers an interpretation in a column entitled &quot;TO THE POINT&quot; :
    &quot;Britain goes up in the world&quot; again thanks to its support for President Bush in
    the Gulf, which &quot;suggests that Britain, not Germany, is the more natural leader for a
    Europe aspiring to greater political unity.&quot; In support of this thesis, the same
    paper also cites &quot;so influential an American organ of opinion&quot; as the Wall
    Street Journal. Moreover, by February 14, the International Herald Tribune would report
    that &quot;Britain has a new credibility within the EC that has been bolstered, for the
    time being at least, by the Gulf crisis, officials said.&quot; Unmentioned but perhaps not
    irrelevant is the consideration that the recession ridden British economy and the London
    financial &quot;City&quot; still need the continued financial support of the Kuwaiti and
    other oil sheiks and that in this same recession the unpopular Tory government was in dire
    need of a political boost. A jingoist war in the Gulf offerred both. </p>
    <p>In Japan, in Germany and even in France the heads of government had more trouble
    bypassing their parliaments and/or twisting their arms to exact support for Mr. Bush's
    war. All in turn were subject to blackmail and arm twisting from Washington, also
    ironically exercised through Secretary of State Baker's trip around the world to pass the
    hat for financial contributions to the &quot;common cause.&quot; Considerable powers of
    persuasion by the governments of the United States and their allies were necessary and
    exercised, because the people and their elected representatives in these countries had
    much trouble understanding just what they were supposed to contribute their taxes for, or
    why. </p>
    <h5>Free Press Censorship, Self-censorship and Orwellian New Speak</h5>
    <p>The Gulf War was accompanied and indeed prepared by the biggest media blitz in world
    history. However, when war breaks out, the first casualty is the truth -- it was said
    already during the Crimean War 130 years ago. Poor Joseph G&#148;bbels. Hitler's minister
    who made the management of racist and totalitarian war propaganda synonymous with his
    name, would have had to start again in Kindergarten to learn today's high-tech news
    management of Orwellian New Speak to brainwash a global population via instant satellite
    TV. If democracy relies on informed people, all semblance of democratic procedures were
    thrown to the wolves. They clad themselves in sheeps' clothing not to misinform Little Red
    Ridinghood but supposedly educated responsible adult citizens and voters. &quot;Managing
    the news was seen as part of the war-winning effort&quot; as the TV reporter Geoff Meade
    observed from his posting in Saudi Arabia. Indeed. </p>
    <p>The Pentagon managed press [sess?] pool was the most successful military weapon used in
    the war. The pool was designed to permit a military monopoly on gathering, assembling, and
    disseminating information through commission and especially omission. Far from denying
    military secrets to the military enemy in Iraq, however, the pool was intended to and did
    operate to create secrets for and foreclose or neutralize potential civilian enemies of
    the war on the home front. The military command not only prescribed and administered
    sanitized news drop by drop for its dissemination by an obedient medical corps of news
    doctors. The Pentagon news pool also prevented unlicensed practitioners to operate on or
    near the battle field. Moreover, woe was to any independent free-lance or indeed network
    newsman or woman who dared to ask &quot;anti-military&quot; questions about the patient or
    to see him outside of established visiting hours and places, or to disseminate any
    medicine not prescribed by the Pentagon's team of news doctors. Big Brother Pentagon
    immediately blacklisted these undesirable newspeople and denied them access to the
    socialized medicine of the military blood news bank. An information pamphlet was also
    circulated to US troops in Saudi Arabia urging them to avoid any mention to newspeople and
    others of 19 different topics ranging from American good relations with Israel to
    questionable ones with some Arabs. </p>
    <p>Therefore, there were the severest penalties for filming, writing, speaking, editing,
    publishing or otherwise broadcasting any news or any ever so mild critique of the real or
    video shooting war, which was not to the Pentagon's complete liking. Newspeople were
    threatened not only with de-accreditation, but also with deportation from Saudi Arabia and
    environs. Very few took the risk or left on their own account, as a CNN reporter
    apparently did rather than forsaking her integrity. </p>
    <p>The self-censorship by the press at home probably exceeded even the military's blackout
    of battlefield news and its analysis, which might have fed the patient at home with even a
    modicum of the information he might have used to question the aims and prosecution of this
    war. Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) for instance summarizes &quot;Eight
    (Self-)Censored Stories National Media Ignored&quot; in the United States: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. Secret U.S. arms shipments to Iraq during the Reagan Administration; 2. The
      diplomatic scandal of Ambassador Glaspie's signal that the U.S. would not oppose Iraqi
      invasion; 3. The Kuwait connection of its financial clout in the U.S. and the conflict of
      interest of National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft; 4. Racism and bigotry in the U.S.
      military; 5. Slave labor in the Gulf; 6. The true cost of the war including interest and
      veterans' benefits could be more than 10 times the official estimate; 7. The army that
      wasn't there poised to invade Saudi Arabia; and 8. Bush's family ties in the Gulf (quoted
      and paraphrased from Extra, May 1991, p. 16). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These and many other stories were deliberately ignored, because their airing by the
    media might have sown some doubts in the public mind about the justification of this war
    and thereby reduced home front support for the same. Instead, the news were managed to
    rally home front support for the war before, during, and after its bloody prosecution in
    Iraq - and to manage public perception of the political, military and missile/bomb aims
    and victims of the war. They were sanitized through newly mounted video cameras
    accompanied by comments in Orwellian Military NewSpeak. It covered the whole gambit from
    the poisoned alphabet soup of new acronyms for military technology and terminology to the
    sanitized verbs used to &quot;soften up,&quot; &quot;degrade,&quot; &quot;suppress,&quot;
    &quot;take out,&quot; &quot;down,&quot; &quot;cleanse,&quot; &quot;neutralize&quot; and
    &quot;eliminate&quot; mention of killing real people by the hundreds of thousands. The
    famous &quot;collateral damage&quot; was not limited to the &quot;target rich
    environment&quot; of Iraq, but was worldwide -- or was all of that damage to informed
    public opinion and democracy deliberate as well? If so, the media blitz war was successful
    -- and not so. </p>
    <p>For the evidence is that on the home front itself there was still much dissatisfaction
    with the press -- for failing to contribute enough to the war effort! Once the shooting
    started, barrages of letters, phone-ins, interviews, and public opinion polls in the US
    and UK at least gave vent to public demand for even more sanitized news censorship and
    management of their own brainwashed opinion. 80 percent of Americans supported the
    restrictions on the press and 60 percent wanted even more military control over the press
    and information (IHT Feb. 1,1991). So where then was the denial of democracy? Was it in
    managing public opinion less than it wanted? Or was the abrogation of democracy to be
    found in the brainwashing of people who for the whole second half of 1990 knew neither
    what such a war should be fought for, nor wanted it to be fought to begin with -- that is
    before the missile and video shooting started? </p>
    <p>Little wonder that Anthony Lewis could belatedly summarize in the New York Times under
    the title &quot;Docile Media Hawked the Official View of the War&quot;: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Most of the press was not a detached observer of the war, much less a critical one. It
      was a claque applauding the American generals and politicians in charge. In the press I
      include television, its most powerful component now and the most egregious lapdog during
      the war. For the most part the networks simply transmitted official images of neat,
      painless war. Or worse: put a gloss of independent corroboration on those false images.
      And they were false.... Perhaps the most dangerous shortcoming of the press was its
      failure to keep asking whether the war was necessary or wise. Once the bombing started
      that fundamental political question was mostly put aside.... The May issue of Harper's
      Magazine ... [carried an article] by the editor, Lewis H. Lapham and is entitled
      &quot;trained seals and sitting ducks&quot; [which observed that] the administration well
      understood ... that it could rely on the media's complicity in almost any deception
      dressed up in patriotic costume&quot; (IHT May 7, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5>The Violation of Participant Democracy in Civil Society</h5>
    <p>The London Sunday Telegraph (January 20, 1991) offered good advice to Western and other
    governments: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Not that the danger from the peace movement has wholly passed....If things start going
      wrong in the Gulf, we may need to have recourse to jingoism, if only to combat the fire
      and fervour of the peace movement.... For so long as primitive, irrational pacifism can
      continue to cloud the minds of men - as it can and does as never before - so long will it
      be necessary for there to be an equally strong emotional antidote on the other side.... It
      would be a foolish Western leader who threw this indispensable, if ancient and primitive,
      psychological weapon [of jingoism] onto the scrap-heap before victory was assured. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The London Telegraph must be proud to have such attentive and obedient readers in
    Downing Street and the Mother of Parliaments, in the White House and Capitol Hill, and of
    course in Baghdad and all over the Arab and Islamic world too. </p>
    <p>The decisions and faits accomplis to go to war were made at the highest national and
    international levels. These governmental leaders not only failed to consult their
    populations and voters. As we noted above, President Bush deliberately even avoided
    putting the issue to the people's elected representatives in Congress until long after the
    Congressional elections and his subsequent doubling of American Gulf troops in November
    1990. In so doing, these government leaders also pulled the rug out from under the social
    movements in civil society both in the United Sates and Western Europe, after these
    movements had already been bypassed in Eastern Europe. The mobilization of civil society
    around a myriad of local, national, and international issues of gender relations,
    environmental issues, and the peace movement itself received a brutal blow. Even the
    director of that old cold war think tank, the International Institute for Strategic
    Studies, observed in the International Herald Tribune (February 11, 1991) &quot;the
    current collapse of pacifist movements in Western countries, not the least Germany, is one
    of the notable features of the war.&quot; </p>
    <p>That, of course, is one front in which the media played out their assigned roles. A few
    thousand Western hostages in luxury hotels merited banner headlines and major TV coverage,
    while several hundreds of thousands of destitute Third World refugees from Kuwait and Iraq
    went virtually unmentioned. Saddam Hussein's retention of Westerners as his
    &quot;guests&quot; unfortunately facilitated the further popular image equation with the
    hostage syndrome. In the United States early on already, popular reaction - and some
    physical attacks and threats against innocent neighbors - was directed against the Arab
    bogey. Not for nothing were the image of the Arab and of the &quot;terrorist&quot; often
    identified in the popular mind. When Hussein launched his Scud missiles against Israel, he
    helped rally widespread sympathy and media support around the world for Jews and the war
    in defense of Israel. For that reason, many Jews themselves already supported the war
    against Iraq since [before] the beginning. Hussein intended his attack on Israel to
    mobilize support for him among Arabs and other Muslims; but its effect was to was rally
    much more support for the war against him elsewhere. The same Saddam Hussein who had
    received scant media and popular attention when he gassed his Kurdish citizens was then
    vilified as a new &quot;Hitler,&quot; who had to be fought like the old one. Critique of
    this false comparison and the western war aims was then unjustly branded and dismissed as
    &quot;Anti Semitism.&quot; </p>
    <p>In Europe, the media confronted people with a choice between the Iraqi Saddam Hussein
    and the American George Bush. With that choice, the man in the street and in front of his
    TV set chose the white American. More women, fortunately or wisely, refused that false
    Hobson's choice and opted for peace instead. Nonetheless, European civil society rapidly
    became shot through with rabid racism and chauvinism directed against any and all Arabs
    and Turks -- in total disregard of the fact that many governments of Arabian countries and
    Turkey [which also has its eye on some Iraqi petroleum producing territory] were loyal and
    active members of the allied coalition of the Americans and Europeans. Thereby, these West
    Europeans may also have demonstrated a preference for replacing cheap non-European labor
    from the South by the newly available source of European cheap labor from the East.
    Perhaps it was not altogether accidental that half a dozen countries in Western Europe
    chose that time to lift visa requirements for entry by Poles, who came by the train and
    busloads to look for work. </p>
    <p>Nonetheless and very significantly so, western people in Europe, and of course in the
    United States as well, demonstrated that they were not entirely duped by the myths that
    their leaders and the beholden media propagated about this war and the supposed
    &quot;principles&quot; for which it was fought. Instead, these people in the North
    demonstrate through their own belligerent action against colored immigrants or workers
    from the South on the streets at home that they feel and understand the War in the Gulf
    was between their North and the South. In the ex-East, especially in Central and Eastern
    Europe, people as well as their governments sought advantage by siding with the Western
    powers in the Gulf War. They vented their spirits against Third World workers and students
    brought into and still residing in their societies and neighborhoods by the previous
    regimes. </p>
    <p>At the same time, the people in the South felt and understood the same thing about this
    war. That is why all around the equator not only Arabs and not only Muslims, but all kinds
    of other people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America demonstrated against the United States
    and its war against the Third World. They also demonstrated in support of Saddam Hussein
    who, however cynically, has been cast in the role of defender of the South. The cruel fact
    is that in popular perception and feeling in the North as well as in the South, this was a
    WAR BETWEEN &quot;US&quot; AND &quot;THEM&quot;! Alarmingly, this terrible war was also
    fought out in the streets, schools, and institutions of civil society around the world.
    What's more it continues to be fought there long after the allied bombing stopped in Iraq.
    </p>
    <p>Thus, another one of the major political, social, and cultural costs and damages of
    this war has been to feed aggression and pitch neighbor against neighbor in civil society
    neighborhoods West, East, and South. Many people experienced and some testified to
    heightened tension and agressiveness on Western city streets during the war. Soon after
    the war, serious racial disturbances broke out in the American capital, Washington, and in
    the European &quot;capital&quot; Brussells. Moreover, the war and its macho imagery on TV
    meant another big step to the [re] masculinization of society everywhere. The war and the
    world appeared [probably accurately] run by men. Women were portayed in their roles to
    keep the home fires burning on or near military bases in the United States while waiting
    for their men to return from heroic duty in the war. Western TV prominently featured only
    two women in male settings, the American soldier made prisoner by the Iraqis and the BBC
    reporter Kate Adie. Thus, the war and its TV rendition also set back women's position in
    society and their demands and struggle for more equal rights. </p>
    <p>Thus deliberately or not, the Gulf War bypassed, undermined, violated, subverted, and
    otherwise seriously damaged the most precious democratic institutions and processes in the
    very democracies who supposedly went to war to defend democracy against tyranny. This
    violation and sacrifice of democracy, in addition to the negation of peace and threat of
    future wars, are a terrible price to pay for the new world order. </p>
    <h4>MORE POLITICAL COSTS OF THE GULF WAR:THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSIONS</h4>
    <h5>The Peace Dividend Cancelled</h5>
    <p>The most important and most obvious international political cost of the war is to
    peace. This sacrifice of peace, however, has several dimensions, not all of which have
    received the attention they merit. Perhaps the most significant one is the [deliberate?]
    cancellation of the &quot;peace dividend&quot; in its broadest sense, which was perhaps
    naively expected from the end of the cold war. The hoped for peace dividend was not
    limited to the conversion of military production to civilian use or the diversion of
    military budgets to social needs. More importantly, the peace dividend promised a
    transition from cold war and its associated hot wars in the Third World to a new era of
    peace, such as that which broke out in several Third World countries in 1988-89. Then, the
    United Nations successfully intervened to that effect in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia,
    Iran-Iraq, Namibia, if not Nicaragua; and its blue helmets were awarded the Noble Prize
    for Peace. The end of the cold war and its associated stalemate between the superpowers in
    the Security Council held out [vain?] hopes that the UN could finally begin to meet its
    chartered responsibilities to keep the peace. Most important perhaps however, the peace
    dividend was to be the de facto renunciation of war as an instrument of foreign policy in
    the settlement of international disputes, as enshrined 45 years ago in the United Nations
    Charter. </p>
    <p>The Gulf war has dashed all of these peace dividend hopes. Most important and most
    dangerous as a post cold war precedent for the &quot;new&quot; world &quot;order&quot; is
    the renewed resort to war, this time by a coalition of allied Western powers with some
    southern and eastern support. They waged war without any clearly defined cause against a
    solitary small Third World country. This war clearly announces that military might is
    right in all senses of the word. Ominously, this war also threatens the repeated resort to
    similar wars in the future. The linkage of this war to a supposed &quot;new world
    order&quot; is serious, because it demonstrates for all to see that this &quot;new&quot;
    &quot;order&quot; is being initiated and constructed, and then is to be maintained,
    through the wanton destruction of the weak by the military force of the powerful. To do so
    moreover, the Western allies pervert, divert, and subvert the world's and their own most
    precious institutions. The world's United Nations institution is perverted. The Western
    allies own &quot;defensive&quot; military NATO institution is diverted or converted into
    an offensive instrument against the Third World South. Western parliamentary institutions
    are subverted to lend anti-democratic after the fact blessings to the war. Civil society
    is bypassed west, east and south, except to use the emergence of inflamed racism and
    virulent chauvinism to support the war. In the recently &quot;liberated&quot; East, the
    first international policy decisions by the newly &quot;democratizing&quot; governments
    are to support a war against the South in hopes of thereby meriting a few crumbs from the
    Western table. Several Third World and Arab governments are literally bought and paid for
    to lend their support and coverup of this charade against one of their own. The media
    around the world are coopted, censored, and self-censored to present the whole package as
    the beginnings of a just peaceful new world order! We may proceed to examine some of this
    new world order blueprint and construction a bit more carefully. </p>
    <h5>Perversion of the United Nations Peace Mission for War</h5>
    <p>The first and most major institutional sacrifice and cost to peace was the perversion
    of the United Nations. Secretary General of the United Nations Javier Perez de Cuellar has
    declared outright that &quot;this is a US war, not a UN war&quot; and &quot;the Security
    Council is controlled by the United States, Britain and France.&quot; </p>
    <p>The conservative American columnist William Safire wrote under the title &quot;Consider
    These White Lies And the Truths they Veil&quot;: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is not a UN enforcement action; that part of the UN Charter has never been
      invoked. Instead this is a collective defense authorized by the Security Council, similar
      to the Korean defense, which means that the resolutions ... cannot be revoked without
      American concurrence.... America shows obeisance to the UN, but obedience is a white lie:
      The fighting coalition determines ... (William Safire IHT Feb. 26). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>President Bush and his Secretary of State Baker put together a coalition in the
    Security Council first to condemn Iraq, then to impose an embargo, then to authorize
    military teeth to enforce it, and finally to legitimize recourse to war. In all, they got
    twelve UN resolutions in their pocket, as President Bush and Mr. Baker never tired to
    point out. However, they do not say how much their diplomacy paid, bribed, blackmailed or
    strongarmed some member governments to do their bidding. Most significantly, President
    Bush maneuvered the United Nations into legitimizing his actions, without revealing that
    each step of the way would be irreversible nor how it would lead on to the next step to
    war. Yet the Washington Post (International Herald Tribune Jan. 17,1991) quotes a senior
    official and long time aide to President Bush to the effect that he has been prepared for
    war since August. The London Sunday Telegraph (Jan. 20,191) agrees: &quot;President Bush
    and Mrs Thatcher took the decision to go to war long before there was any hope of getting
    UN sanction, and they did so with a justifiable clear conscience.&quot; President Bush
    &quot;always knew what he was going to do and has now done it in his own good time in the
    most favorable diplomatic and military circumstances.&quot; </p>
    <p>The United Nations surely did not know, and certainly was not told by President Bush.
    The UN is not likely to have given him its support for the purpose President Bush had
    known and prepared for &quot;in good conscience&quot; since August. The UN is not likely
    to have voted the same way after the shooting started, if it had the choice. But it did
    not. Indeed, the Security Council was never again convened on the Iraq war until it ended.
    Only then was the Security Council again convened by the United States to legitimize its
    demands for unconditional Iraqi surrender -- and by implication the entire war and
    devastation, to which the United States and its coalition allies had subjected the people
    of Iraq. </p>
    <p>The Security Council violated the United Nations Charter on several counts in
    particular and shirked its general responsibility to the world to keep the peace. Instead,
    the Security Council and the United Nations institution and prestige was perverted to
    &quot;legitimate&quot; war. </p>
    <p>Under the UN Charter, the Security Council mandate is to preserve the peace, not to
    authorize or legitimize war. Moreover, the Charter enjoins or bars the resort to war under
    Article 42 until the Security Council [not the President of the United States] determines
    under Article 41 that all peaceful means to resolve a dispute have been exhausted.
    Clearly, this was not done before this war. Then again, the Security Council, and not
    President Bush, is supposed to decide what to do next with the means at its disposal, not
    those of the United States and its coalition allies. Moreover, under Article 42 the forces
    to be used are those of the United Nations, which can &quot;include&quot; those of member
    states. The armed forces used in the Gulf war, however, were not the UN blue helmets, and
    the coalition allies did not even, as in Korea, fight under the UN flag. Resolution 678
    stipulated that &quot;all necessary means&quot; could be used to evict the Iraqis from
    Kuwait if they did not leave on their own by January 15. Of course under the Charter
    again, what &quot;all necessary means&quot; may be is to be determined by the Security
    Council and not by the United States. Finally, of course, all the political and military
    decisions were made by the American President and military commander. For their own
    reasons and purposes and with out any advice or consent from the United Nations, the
    American led coalition clearly used far more deadly means than necessary. As observed
    above, the United Nations Security Council was never again convened or consulted during
    the course of the war. Its pursuit therefore was condemned only in their own names by the
    Secretariat staff of the United Nations! </p>
    <p>In fact however, even the procedural legality of the Security Council resolutions is in
    doubt on several counts under the UN Charter. One of these is that under the Charter's
    Article 27, Clause 3, all five permanent members of the Security Council must cast an
    affirmative vote for a decision to be valid. However, China did not vote affirmatively,
    but abstained on the crucial Resolution 678 to use &quot;all necessary means&quot; after
    the January 15 deadline for Iraq to get out of Kuwait. Only by convention, but not by the
    Charter, is an abstention not counted as a veto. [The United States used the same sort of
    convention to marshall UN support for its war in Korea, while the Soviet Union was
    temporarily boycotting the UN and China was denied its seat]. Thus by all counts, this war
    was not a United Nations war. However, the war was falsely presented as being sanctioned
    by the United Nations and the 12 resolutions, which the United States exacted from the
    Security Council to use in flouting and deceiving public opinion in the world. In so doing
    and in the service of its own questionable motives to say the least, the United States
    deliberately subverted the institution and prestige of the United Nations. </p>
    <p>The imposition of the January 15 deadline and the commitment of military forces to the
    Gulf war by other countries were other ineluctable steps on the road to war. These steps
    were (deliberately) made necessary by the foregoing ones to begin with. That is, both
    presidents Hussein and Bush built up military forces and political positions, which made
    further escalation necessary. The American military forces and perhaps the coalition
    alliance could not be maintained in the Gulf without further escalation. In particular, it
    was realized that the military forces could not continue to sit on their hands
    indefinitely and especially not after the onset of the sandstorms in the Spring. Then and
    during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, these forces also could no longer go on the
    offensive. Therefore, it became necessary to get an earlier deadline for them to be put
    into action. Better sooner than later, and the Security Council obliged with a January 15
    deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. </p>
    <p>Of course, the United States had the enthusiastic collaboration of the United Kingdom,
    the reluctant cooperation of France, the silent acquiescence of the Soviet Union, and the
    abstention of China among the permanent members with veto powers on the Security Council.
    They and some other members of the Security Council lent their votes and/or their silence
    to this perversion of the Charter and this hijacking of the name and prestige of the
    United Nations for this sordid war. Instead of preserving the peace, the United Nations
    was used to further an illegitimate and unnecessary war. The cost of this precedent to the
    people and peace of the world could not be higher. It will have to continue to be paid for
    years to come. American begnine neglect and payments arrears in the UN were less damaging
    than US [mis]use of the UN to further its own imperial ambitions. The United Nations
    itself became the first major casualty of the Gulf War. </p>
    <p>Indeed, &quot;the diplomatic activity of the UN was impeded from the very
    beginning&quot; and &quot;The US and the United Kingdom, mainly, was opposed to the
    Secretary General's involvement&quot; according to the Yemeni Ambassador to the UN and its
    representative on the Security Council, Abdallah al-Ashtal (MERIP, March-April 1991, p.
    9). UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar himself said that his hands were tied and
    he was powerless. Why did he, like Soviet Foreign Minister Sheverdnaze or French Defense
    Minister Chevennement, not resign? At least that way he could have helped to dramatize and
    expose or perhaps even stop the charade of using a United Nations cover for a United
    States war! </p>
    <h5>NATO Redirected Southward</h5>
    <p>The diversion and redirection of the NATO alliance and institution by President Bush
    from East-West conflicts to North-South ones portends a most serious precedent for the
    world as a whole. Indeed de facto, President Bush already set a very serious precedent in
    November, when he sent to the Gulf the American NATO troop contingents, which had been
    stationed under American NATO command in Germany. De facto also, President Bush used NATO
    facilities and American supplied military hardware - and no doubt software also - for
    deployment to the Gulf and asked his NATO allies in Europe to step into their place with
    their own. This quiet diplomacy and de facto policy of faits accompli by President Bush to
    transform the function and direction of NATO threatens to become one of the most dangerous
    legacies of the Gulf War for the rest of the world. Thus, the integrity of NATO and the
    peace dividend from the end of the cold war were another major casualty of President
    Bush's Gulf War policy even before the first shot was fired. </p>
    <p>NATO was also used to blackmail a reluctant Germany into active miliary support for the
    Gulf War. Germany is preoccupied with its own unification and is scarcely interested in
    direct support for President Bush's war policies in the Gulf. So President Bush found a
    round about way to involve Germany too. Fellow NATO country Turkey shares a border with
    Iraq. Its government has been an American client all through the cold war, and still is.
    Thus, it was not too difficult for President Bush and Mr. Baker to bring Turkey first into
    the embargo and then into the alliance against Iraq. That exposed Turkey to a potential
    threat from Iraq. Therefore, why not have Turkey call on its NATO allies for protection
    against this real or imagined threat by Iraq. Still better, Turkey could make a direct
    appeal to fellow NATO member Germany. It did, and Germany was obliged by NATO rules to
    send at least a squadron of military aircraft to Turkey. Germany, like Japan, is
    prohibited by its American imposed constitution from sending its military forces abroad,
    except in its own defense. However, it is permitted to so dispatch its military within the
    framework of NATO. </p>
    <p>Thus, President Bush managed to divert both Germany and NATO from their regional
    concerns and potentially to engage them in his war against a Third World country in the
    Gulf. Turkey agreed to permit the use of its soil for American military aircraft to attack
    Iraq. [First the announcement was withheld; then the American flights were called
    &quot;training missions;&quot; finally it turned out they had been flying bombing missions
    every six hours for three days before the announcement]. That is another one of President
    Bush's faits accomplis. It opened a second front against Iraq in the north and exposed
    Turkey to retaliation by Iraq. The latter, however, was constrained by what would have
    been an attack by a country that is not a member against one that is a member of NATO -
    and therefore on NATO itself. This NATO alliance includes Germany as its most reluctant
    member country, which would thereby have been dragged into Mr. Bush's war as well. </p>
    <p>To short cut or indeed altogether to eliminate such problems the next time around, the
    Dutch now propose to restructure their NATO contingent armed forces for rapid intervention
    more in North-South than East-West conflicts. NATO itself is now more seriously discussing
    already previously tabled proposals to redirect its political attention and military
    organization to intervene in North-South conflicts. &quot;NATO Military Commanders Agree
    To Work for a Rapid Reaction Corps,&quot; which would number 70,000 to 100,000 troops from
    various European countries with US air support for &quot;maximum flexibility&quot; (IHT
    April 13-14, 1991). For his part, the European Commission President Jacques Delors has
    proposed that the European Community also needs a transnational rapid intervention force
    to forge a military capacity and establish political authority to participate in the next
    conflict in its area of interest in the South or East. Again, the Gulf War's legacy of
    future danger to the Third World South [soon to include parts of formerly Eastern Europe}
    could not be greater as the West now redirects its political and military institutions
    better and more forcefully to intervene there. </p>
    <h5>The Middle East Convulsed</h5>
    <p>Far from settling any of the longstanding political problems in the Middle East, the
    Gulf war first exacerbated them, and then made them even more difficult to address and
    solve. The strengthened recalcitrance in and by Israel through its &quot;non&quot;
    participation in the Gulf War and the political weakening of the PLO leadership, as well
    as of the Jordanian King Hussein, are only the most visible and interrelated iceberg tips.
    So are the postwar Shiite and Kurdish rebellions in Iraq. Even the mildest success of the
    Iranian supported Shiites is not at all in the interests of America and its European or
    Arab allies, for whom the mullahs in Iran are more than enough. Therefore, the Iraqi
    Shiite opposition has received neither western or other allied support nor publicity.
    However, Iraqi Kurdish demands for autonomy also threaten Turkey and Iran. Therefore,
    their demands for autonomy, or God forbid independence, cannot be tolerated either, and
    they are at best publicized and manipulated only as long as they can be used for ulterior
    allied motives in northern Iraq. &quot;For Exiles, the Bitter Truth is that No One Wanted
    them to Win&quot; (IHT April 12, 1991). That includes the democratic opposition forces in
    and exiles from Iraq. Who in the world except them and their people would want a
    democratic Iraq? No one, of course, especially if a democratic example in Iraq were to
    become contagious among its neighbors. Better to leave Iraq with weakened but still
    adequate military forces to continue the Baathist military regime, without Saddam Hussein
    if possible but with him if necessary, to maintain the integrity and control of the Iraqi
    state. For Iraq is still needed as a linchpin to maintain stability in the region, which
    in the aftermath of the Gulf War is now threatened ever more than before. </p>
    <p>For many Arab governments are threatened to become further casualties of the Gulf War.
    Some were at risk already before the fighting started. Now the autocratic Arab governments
    that sided with and/or were bought off by President Bush have thereby sacrificed what
    little popular support and legitimacy they still had. They have further cemented their
    dependence on the United States, and the United States is now obliged to prop them up
    politically and subsidize them economically [which it can ill afford] even more than
    before. Popular uprisings, if not military coups or splits, are now likely in one country
    in the Middle East after another. That is why the Israeli ex-minister Isaac Rabin
    recommends that the wealthy Gulf countries contribute their oil riches especially to Egypt
    and Syria &quot;to stabilize the moderate regimes in the international coalition so that
    they can maintain themselves in the face of the zero sympathy of their citizens&quot;
    (interview in El Pais, February 10, 1991). </p>
    <p>In these circumstances, it was another sham for President Bush to have promised to
    bring the American troops back home just as soon as possible after completing their job in
    Iraq. For President Bush knowingly committed American troops to &quot;stabilize&quot; the
    Middle East for a long time to come. Now the </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>U.S. Weighs Command Post in Bahrain and Keeping Troops With Saudis... [which] has been
      a goal sought by the Pentagon for years, but was resisted by leaders of Gulf nations....
      General Powell says 'We have always been anxious too have a forward headquarters in the
      region, and I think we may be able to get one this time'&quot; (IHT March 26, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>DE- AND DOWN-GRADING EUROPE, JAPAN AND THE SOVIET UNION</h4>
    <p>With the help of their &quot;special relationship&quot; with Britain and her sycophant
    governments and press, the United States already achieved major political coups in Western
    Europe beyond getting its support for the war itself. President Bush successfully bluffed
    or finessed all of the West Europeans to line up behind him -- and to fall out among each
    other. Mrs. Thatcher lost the battle and her job, but she won her war both in Iraq and in
    Europe! The Gulf crisis and war would exacerbate the political and economic conflicts of
    policy within Europe, on which she made her stand against a more united Western Europe. </p>
    <p>In the Gulf crisis, the West Europeans gave up all pretense at a unified and
    independent European foreign policy. In particular, the relatively more constructive and
    progressive European policy towards, and good will in, the Middle East was sacrificed.
    European intervention in favor of a more reasonable settlement of the Palestine-Israeli
    issue receded beyond the visible horizon. Israel's all purpose ex-minister, Isaac Rabin,
    recently declared that Israel has no use for Europe or the United Nations. For the time
    being, the American-Israeli line is unchallenged, except by the for now weakened Arabs
    themselves. </p>
    <p>Another coup is the already observed transformation and diversion of NATO. Far from
    constructing a stronger post cold war [West] European pillar in NATO, let alone an
    alternative European security system, the West Europeans have now acceded to an already
    earlier American pressure, which they previously resisted: To turn the NATO thrust
    southeastward to intervene in the Middle East in particular, and in North-South conflicts
    in general. American troops, bases, material, and logistics, but also those of several
    European countries' NATO contingents were diverted from the defense of Western Europe
    against the Soviet Union to the attack against Iraq in the Middle East! They even took
    their central European AirLand battle plans with them to the Arabian desert. </p>
    <p>Moreover, the Europeans not only paid their own but also many of the American costs of
    this diversion. Europeans even paid for the fuel that American B 52 bombers used when they
    took off from and were refueled at bases in Europe. The &quot;Socialist&quot; government
    of Felipe Gonzalez in Spain even tried to keep this take off secret, if only because it
    had won an earlier referendum to keep Spain in NATO with the quid-pro-que offer to voters
    to maintain Spain free from the NATO military command structure and related military
    commitments. Since he now activated secret commitments to the United States to use Spanish
    air bases in case of &quot;need,&quot; he also kept the whole sordid business secret,
    until the American press inadvertently let the cat out of the bag! </p>
    <p>Thus, West Europeans supported President Bush's war politically, militarily, and
    financially, even with significant financial contributions from Germany. Beyond that, the
    European Economic Community finally also caved in on the issue of agricultural price
    supports, its biggest protectionist measure, which had scuttled the last meeting of GATT.
    Symbolically, the last deadline for GATT reconsideration was the same January 15, 1991 set
    by the United Nations for Iraq to get out of Kuwait -- and for the United States to go to
    war! </p>
    <p>For their part, the East Europeans did all they could to scramble onto the Western
    victory train, and Czechoslovakia even sent troops to Saudi Arabia. However it is doubtful
    that the rewards of any amount of kowtowing to the West in the Gulf War can compensate
    Central and East Europe for the major political and economic losses, which this war
    represents for them. Indirectly, the Gulf War certainly diverted western political and
    economic attention and funds at the worst possible moment from reconstruction in Europe to
    destruction in the Middle East. More directly, the temporary rise in the price of oil cost
    East Europeans dearly during the autumn and winter cold precisely when they had to start
    paying hard cash instead of [non]convertible rubles to pay for Soviet oil. Additionally,
    they had to import more oil from other areas. At the same time moreover, they lost the
    previously agreed repayment of Iraq's debt to them through Iraqi oil exports to Eastern
    Europe. They were supposed to be stepped up to repay these debts, but instead they were
    cancelled by the embargo against Iraq. Thus, the Gulf War came at bad time for and gave a
    bad time to Central and Eastern Europe. </p>
    <p>The Gulf War participation in and consequences for the Soviet Union are less clear, but
    for that perhaps even more dangerous. No less but more significantly than in Central and
    Eastern Europe, Gorbachev's government in the Soviet Union sought to be on its best
    behavior and caved in and/or sold out to the United States and its Western allies. This
    concession, of course, was essential to construct the charade of the United Nations cover
    for the American war plan. Even an opportune Soviet abstention, not to mention a veto, at
    the Security Council would itself have tipped the balance and would probably have changed
    the votes of China and France as well. However, President Gorbachev went along with
    President Bush, except for his and his envoy Primakov's vain effort to shore up the waning
    Soviet role in the area. As it turned out, its role in the Gulf War sacrificed Soviet
    influence over its Arab friends; the war further increased sympathy among its own Muslim
    population with their Islamic brethren abroad; and Soviet military leaders had to witness
    the miserable defeat of the Soviet weapons systems and their military strategy of its
    client army in Iraq. Of course, the Soviet Union also faces more serious domestic
    problems. </p>
    <p>If and when these Soviet problems result in a replacement of the regime or even of the
    government however, Gorbachev's concessions and Soviet losses in the Middle East through
    the Gulf War may contribute to strengthening the hand of military and other conservative
    forces who demand some return to the past and/or Soviet or even Russian play with their
    only remaining strong, that is the military, card. After all, the intended Gulf War lesson
    that the threat and use of military power gets results must be making school in the Soviet
    Union as well. At the same time, the military- industrial complex may also play its
    strengthened hand in the United States, which itself also has none other left to play in
    the world at large. Secretary of Defense Cheney already declared on TV that if US-Soviet
    tensions do not continue to decline he would have to tell President Bush &quot;I am sorry,
    but we cannot carry arms reductions as far and fast as we had originally thought&quot; (El
    Dia Latinoamericano, April 29, 1991, p. 17). In that case, the beginning of a Third Cold
    War cannot be excluded; and the Gulf War would have done its bit to promote that
    additional disaster for the world and its &quot;new order&quot; as well. </p>
    <h4>NORTH-SOUTH WAR TO PUT THE THIRD WORLD IN ITS PLACE IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER</h4>
    <p>The same already quoted editorial of the London Telegraph (January 20,1991) also
    clarifies why President Bush chose to flaunt American power against Iraq in the Gulf War: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[It] does sound cynical. But it also goes to the heart of the matter. For there is a
      clash of interest between the First World and the Third World, and no international order
      satisfactory to the former should rely on the say-so of an institution [like the United
      Nations] dominated numerically by the latter.... Sooner or later the Third World will
      throw up other challenges. But if the Gulf war ends as it has begun, there can be no doubt
      who are the masters now - at any rate for another generation.... Not only will our arms
      have prevailed in a most spectacular fashion. So also will our ideals&quot; (Emphasis in
      the original, Amen). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here we have the real significance of the Gulf War, which was promoted and led by the
    &quot;ideals&quot; of President George Bush, the Commander in Chief of the world's
    greatest military power, who wants to use this war to initiate his NEW WORLD ORDER. </p>
    <p>Beyond being a war between the North and the South, perhaps the clearest gulf in this
    War is between the rich on one side and the poor on the other. Obviously, the Western
    powers in this war represent above all the interests of the rich in the world. Perhaps the
    Texans, President Bush and Secretary of State Baker, also represent the rich Texas oil
    interests more than they would like to admit. However, the Saudi Arabs [the original
    dispatch of troops was for their protection!], the Emirates and the Kuwaitis are also
    among the oil rich, who are reputed to have placed some US $ 670 billion worth of
    investments abroad (Peter Custers in Economic and Political Weekly, Jan. 5-12, 1991).
    Sukumar Muralidharan suggests that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>the need to safeguard oil sources is only the stated agenda behind the assault on Iraq.
      The far more fundamental concern is the need to protect the West's pre-emptive claim on
      the financial surpluses of the Arab world. These are vital for underwriting the political
      stability of the US and the UK, which are today in irretrievable industrial decline, and
      desperately need the rentier incomes arising from the recycling of these surpluses.... The
      pathological character of the hate campaign launched against President Saddam Hussein ...
      speaks of a desperate vendetta against a man who has dared to challenge the financial
      hegemony of the west (Economic and Political Weekly, March 30, 1991, p. 838). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Kuwaitis and its ruling Al Sabah family alone have some US $ 200 billion of
    investments overseas, many of them in commercial and political joint ventures in the
    United States and Britain. Of course, these investments and relations also afford the
    Kuwaitis continued income and political influence in there even without drawing up another
    drop of oil at home. Suffice it to ask whether the rich West would have sent over half a
    million troops to defend any poor country or people elsewhere in Africa or anywhere else.
    The other Arabs in the coalition are the American client governments also representing the
    rich in their respective countries. The poor populations of these same Arab countries were
    massively on the other side of this conflict in support of Iraq, whose President Hussein
    opportunistically declared himself their and the poor Palestinians' and other Muslims'
    spokesman. As we observed above, throughout the Third World South masses of the people
    understood that this Gulf War was designed and executed to put them in their place in Mr.
    Bush's &quot;new&quot; world order. </p>
    <p>The deadly threat of mass destruction of anyone who might wish to take exception to or
    even rebel against this world &quot;order&quot; was pressed home demonstrably by the bombs
    launched against the innocent people of Iraq and their ideological cover up at the
    &quot;United&quot; Nations, the &quot;coalition&quot; of the Western allies, their
    controlling interest in the &quot;free&quot; press media, etc. </p>
    <p>It is no joke that the April first cover of Time Magazine depicts the US &quot;GLOBO
    COP. COMING SOON TO YOUR COUNTRY?&quot; Time took the trouble to send its reporters around
    the Third World and elsewhere to ask how people view the &quot;New World Order.&quot; The
    introductory summary of Time's findings in cover story on the &quot;Global Beat&quot; is
    that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Critics protest that Bush's proclaimed new world order conjures up misty and dangerous
      visions of a militaristic American Globo-cop on the march... </p>
      <p>[A huge placard depicting a dozen skulls surrounding the words &quot;THE NEW WORLD
      ORDER&quot; is subtitled] AN INTENSELY SKEPTICAL WORLD. Despite Bush's view of America as
      &quot;the last, best hope of mankind, &quot; people around the globe - along with New York
      City protesters - fear that the U.S. plans to exercise naked power to secure dominance.
      Even sympathizers with Bush's ideal wonder whether it can remedy the causes of war. </p>
      <p>Said the President: &quot;the victory over Iraq was not waged as 'a war to end all
      wars.' Even the new world order cannot guarantee an era of perpetual peace.&quot; Far from
      it: the new order, such as it is, cannot even guarantee that national interests will ever
      again converge as they did in the gulf war. </p>
      <p>By itself, Bush's successful &quot;first test&quot; of the new world order carried the
      seeds of future disaster.... </p>
      <p>What Bush's vision has also failed to take into account is a sense in many developing
      countries that the old world order was preferable. For all its nuclear terrors and proxy
      conflicts, the cold war balance-of-power architecture was a place that came to feel like
      home. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As if to rub in the point, in early April the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
    General Colin Powell, declared in Honduras </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>we hope that in this New World Order conflicts will be solved through negotiations and
      not through acts of war, so that there need be no repetition of what happened in the Gulf.
      But if it is necessary to defend freedom, it can be done (El Dia Latinoamericano, May 13,
      1991, retranslated from Spanish by AGF). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the meantime, the annual American military exercises with nuclear weapons in Korea
    began a month earlier and ended a month later than usual, and North Korea denounced them
    to the United Nations as a trial invasion of that country. Assistant Secretary of State
    Richard Solomon in turn denounced North Korea, and spokesmen in the American press have
    already called North Korea &quot;a potential Iraq&quot; (El Dia Latinoamericano, May 13,
    1991). Many more people of course, now fear renewed American threats against Cuba. </p>
    <p>Nonetheless, President Bush finds ever newer words to describe his new world order,
    which </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>really describes a responsibility imposed by our success. It refers to new ways of
      working with other nations to deter aggression and to achieve stability, to achieve
      prosperity, and above all, to achieve peace. It springs from hopes based on a shared
      commitment ...[for] peaceful settlement of disputes, solidarity against aggression,
      reduced and controlled arsenals, and just treatment of all peoples. [That is] the quest
      for a new world order (IHT April 15, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The translation into plain english or &quot;into Christian&quot; as Spanish speaking
    people say is to be found in a myriad of publications and statements from South Asia to
    South America. All testify to learning the first lesson in Mr. Bush's war school for the
    Third World in his new world order: Dare once again to lift your head against the
    &quot;national interest&quot; of the United States, whatever that may be, and you expose
    your country to being returned to the stone age and your population to annihilation from
    on high. North-South political and economic polarization is to continue apace, and no
    Southern political economic challenges thereto will be tolerated. That is the THIRD WORLD
    WAR against the South! Is it also to be waged by another Third Reich ? </p>
    <p>However, there is also a message for America's economic competitors and political
    allies in the West [and perhaps for any rivals in what remains of the East]: Military
    power can be used and of use as an alternative to economic strength, especially when the
    latter is lacking. For military power is the only thing the United States has left, and it
    is the only thing it is capable of still flaunting to maintain any political power in the
    face of the &quot;virtually irrelevant&quot; growing economic power of Japan and Germany,
    &quot;no matter&quot; the Russians. </p>
    <p>Fortunately, there are some reasons to doubt the American capacity, albeit not its
    intentions, for the United States to rely only on its military power to carry out this
    role of global cop in the Third World and powerful bully on the block among its allies in
    the West. Time refers to the &quot;pre-eminent apostle of realpolitik&quot; Henry
    Kissinger who observed that the alliance and war against Iraq was &quot;an almost
    accidental combination of circumstances unlikely to be repeated in the future.&quot;
    Indeed, the original deployment of American and other troops and equipment was &quot;to
    defend Saudi Arabia&quot; from possible, albeit never threatened, attack by Iraq. However,
    there was at least one other reason for the choice of Saudi Arabia as the site for the
    massive buildup: During more than a decade after the debacle with Iran, the United States
    had built up Saudi Arabia as its client regional military power in the Middle East, next
    to Israel. The United States sold Saudi Arabia US $ 50 billions of arms [in support of its
    own industry and balance of payments] and built up a whole network of naval and air bases,
    which Saudi Arabia pledged to make available to the United States for use in case of an
    emergency in the Middle East. Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait provided that emergency.
    Then, the United States shipped half a million troops and their supporting naval and air
    forces to Saudi Arabia, which is the only place that has the necessary ground facilities
    ready to receive them! </p>
    <p>Even so, the allies had over 5 months time to put their offensive capacities in place
    there. Therefore, the deputy commander of the U.S. Military Transportation command
    observed that &quot;we ought to keep in perspective that we've had the luxury of time --
    161 days to land all that stuff without anybody firing a shot.&quot; Moreover, &quot;47
    percent of it came from foreign ships, which might not be available in the next
    emergency.&quot; These facts, argues the Washington Post, &quot;make Operation Desert
    Storm an inadequate test of the U.S. military's usefulness in forging what President Bush
    called 'a new world order,' according to military analysts&quot; (International Herald
    Tribune February 11, 1991). </p>
    <p>We need note only in passing how these analysts and publicists also take it for granted
    that &quot;The New World Order&quot; is to be &quot;forged&quot; by U.S. military
    intervention in one &quot;emergency&quot; after another. But at what political and
    economic cost, and can the United States afford them? In the case of the Gulf War against
    Iraq, the answer is yes, but perhaps also under &quot;circumstances unlikely to be
    repeated in the future.&quot; For the direct out-of- pocket [and off-budget!] expenses of
    the war for United States have been variously estimated from US$ 30 to 57 billion. Yet,
    the United States already received pledges, and in many cases payments, of direct foreign
    financial contributions totalling over $54 billion: Saudi Arabia $ 17 billion, Kuwait $ 16
    billion, The United Arab Emirates $ 4 billion, Germany over $ 6 billion, Japan almost $ 11
    billion, and even South Korea $ 385 million. Unnamed other countries pledged additional $
    15 billion. By early May 1990 all but $ 18 billion had already been paid out (IHT May
    11-12, 1991). </p>
    <p>This war, therefore, was profitable business for the Wild West style gun for hire
    American mercenary forces, whose motto in the new world order could be &quot;have [only]
    gun, will travel.&quot; Over and above these direct payments, of course, predominantly
    American construction and other firms, private and public including the US Army Corps of
    Engineers, are running away with the lion's share of Kuwaiti and other contracts to
    reconstruct the destruction caused by this war, at least where there is money to pay for
    this reconstruction. </p>
    <p>Finally, the Pentagon and its associated military-industrial complex has already
    announced a major campaign of tens of billions of new arms sales for the wholesale
    replenishment and extension of military arsenals in the Middle East. First the Americans
    and their European allies armed the Shah of Iran to the teeth. Then they sold their arms
    to President Hussein to cut Iran's successor regime down to size. Then the same allies
    bombed Hussein's war machine to smithereens. Now they propose to provide more arms to
    their next client in the region. It is living dangerously indeed to be an American client
    state in the Middle East [or for that matter in Panama and Central America], but to build
    them up and then abandon them is also profitable for the United States, indeed. </p>
    <p>The old world order make work schemes in the Great Depression of paying workers to dig
    holes and fill them up again, or paying farmers to grow and then bury crops, were small
    potatoes compared to the destruction/reconstruction nice cop/bad cop schemes of the new
    world order. Some progress! </p>
    <h4>THE UNITED STATES IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER</h4>
    <p>Former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski has made his balance sheet of the
    &quot;principal benefits and debits of the U.S.- led triumph&quot;: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The benefits are undeniably impressive. First, a blatant act of aggression was rebuffed
      and punished. An important political and even legal point, central to international
      decency, was reaffirmed.... Second, U.S. military power is henceforth likely to be taken
      more seriously...[and] is bound to have a chilling effect even as far away as North
      Korea.... Third, the Middle East and the Gulf region are now clearly an American sphere of
      preponderance. Pro-American Arab regimes feel more secure; so does Israel. U.S. access to
      oil is now not in jeopardy. Fourth, the Soviet Union ... has been reduced largely to the
      status of a spectator (IHT April 22, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, Brzezinski also finds some negative consequences on the scales: Iraq's defeat
    benefits Iran in the region; its ethnic, religious and tribal animosities are intensified
    and threaten 'Lebanonization;' Arabs may conclude from their bombardment that Americans
    view them as worthless; &quot;and that raises the moral question of the proportionality of
    the response ... especially given the idea of the 'just war' (ibid.). </p>
    <p>Nevertheless though Brzezenski does not explicitly say so, little doubt can remain then
    that the main purpose and result of President Bush's American led the Gulf War was another
    last ditch attempt to make former President Reagan's promise come true to &quot;make
    America Number One Again.&quot; As we observed, President Reagan tried and failed to do so
    through the economic means of military Keynesianism and spent the United States into
    economic and social bankruptcy. President Bush is trying to change the global rules of the
    game from economic competition, in which America is losing, to military competition in
    which it still has a near monopoly of power. The Gulf War was designed and used by
    President Bush to flaunt this power both against the Third World in the South [and East]
    and against his own economically more powerful allies in the West. Thus this Gulf War by a
    pack of wolves in the West against poor sacrificial lambs in the South was used to try to
    turn the political economic tables among the hungry wolves themselves. The conservative
    American columnist Charles Krauthammer observes that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>if we Americans want relative stability in the world we are going to have to work for
      it. It will come neither of itself or as a gift from the Security Council. It will only
      come from a U.S. foreign policy of &quot;robust and difficult interventionism.&quot;...We
      have entered a period of Pax Americana. Why deny it. Every other nations would like to be
      in America's position. Why be embarrassed by it? (IHT March 23-24, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Lest there be any disbelief, we may appeal to the authority of President Bush and the
    American people themselves. President Bush: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We saved Europe, cured polio, went to the moon and lit the world with our culture. Now
      we are on the verge of a new century, and what country's name will it bear? I say it will
      be another American century. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The same August 1 issue of Time observes that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Some of Washington's closest European allies wonder whether the scheme is not just an
      exercise in nostalgia - a wishful excursion back into the 1950s, when America has both the
      will and the wallet to dictate to the rest of the planet. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, that is precisely what both President Bush and the American people are doing.
    For the two most important reasons and explanations for the American flag waving and
    yellow ribbon chauvinistic popular enthusiasm for the war [once it started] and the
    victory were precisely: 1. The Gulf War offered Americans the opportunity to &quot;lick
    the Vietnam syndrome&quot; of defeat by a poor Third World country. 2. A Gulf War victory
    could assuage their deep down feelings of shame for being economically bested by the
    Japanese and other Asians - abroad and at home! By &quot;taking [it] out&quot; on and
    &quot;neutralizing&quot; or &quot;eliminating&quot; a half million poor Iraqis, these
    proud Americans could also eliminate their self doubts and again be &quot;proud to be an
    American&quot; in &quot;God's Country&quot;! </p>
    <p>The opposite side of the same coin is displayed by John Lewis Gaddis in Foreign
    Affairs, published by the American establishment's Council of Foreign Affairs: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A kind of division of labor has developed within the international community, in which
      the United States contributes the troops and weapons needed to sustain the balance of
      power while its allies finance the budgetary, energy and trade deficits American incur
      through their unwillingness to make even minimal sacrifices ... of life- style and
      pocketbook&quot; (quoted by Jim Hoagland, IHT April 23, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In plain English, of course, this &quot;balance&quot; is to keep the otherwise
    rambunctious Third World peoples in their place in the South, which is assigned to them in
    both the Old and New World Order. </p>
    <p>However, over the short run even the Europeans and Japanese also sat up and took notice
    of America's military business success in the Gulf War. In world markets, foreign interest
    in America revived to share its victory bonanza. Stock markets and the dollar shot up.
    Political and economic negotiators began to knuckle under the Americans, for instance
    regarding the above mentioned European and Japanese agricultural price supports and other
    obstacles to the American way in the GATT Uruguay round negotiations. Also, there is
    &quot;For U.S., New Clout in OPEC.&quot; &quot;I think we are going to see a closer
    relationship between the Gulf oil producers and ourselves. We had been laying the
    foundations for some time, and the house was built very quickly when the war came&quot;
    observes the US Assistant Secretary of Energy (IHT March 6,1991). Moreover, &quot;Gulf
    states are much more open to military cooperation with the United States now than before
    the Gulf War&quot; (IHT May 11-12, 1991). American control of the Middle Eastern oil on
    which Europe and Japan are dependent could come in useful as a bargaining chip to extract
    future political economic concessions from them on a myriad of other potential conflicts
    of interest. </p>
    <p>So how long will or can this second Western honeymoon and this new Middle Eastern
    house, both made in heaven over Iraq, last? Only time will tell. Or is even that honeymoon
    an illusion? The Chairman of the US Senate Commerce Committee writes under the title
    &quot;Trade Wars: Time for an America That Can Say No&quot;: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Last year we won the Cold War. This year we won the Gulf war. Now it is time to win the
      war that really matters for America's future: the trade war -- the no-holds-barred
      struggle among nations for market share and standard of living in a largely zero-sum world
      market place (IHT March 27, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The perhaps ironic question remains whether in the long run this North-South War in the
    Gulf will recoup American hegemony or help destroy it. President Bush is well aware of
    this major question. He devoted much of his January 1991 State of the Union Message to the
    Gulf War and gave his answer directly to this question and perhaps indirectly to why he
    went to war against Iraq in the first place: America's responsibility to &quot;defend
    freedom&quot; is greater than ever and therein its golden age lies not behind, but before
    it. The 21st century too will be an American century, he said. President Bush may not be
    deliberately bluffing when he says so; but does he have the political economic cards in
    his hand to make his prediction come true? Or may the ultimate economic irony be that this
    gamble at prolonging the American century through yet another war will cost the United
    States so much as to become its last Indian summer Swan song? </p>
    <p>The longer term question remains whether the BRAVO FOR BRAVADO of President Bush's NEW
    WORLD ORDER will really save the United States or even himself. Or will President Bush's
    adventurism bankrupt and sink the United States even further than his mentor Ronald
    Reagan, who promised to make &quot;America Number One Again&quot; and nearly bankrupted
    the United States instead? It well may, especially in face of the new world economic
    recession and the &quot;virtually irrelevant economic power of Japan and Germany&quot; to
    whom President Bush had to send Secretary of State Baker hat in hand to help finance his
    war in the Gulf. </p>
    <p>This recession/war is not likely to turn out like previous ones. World War II pulled
    the United States out of the Depression and made it hegemonic. The Korean War pulled the
    United States out of the recession of 1949 and launched the military Keynesianism, which
    helped ward off the feared economic stagnation. The Vietnam War was enough for the United
    States to avoid the recession, which hit Germany and Japan in 1967. It was not enough to
    prevent the recession of 1970, and certainly not to ward off the first severe post war
    recession of 1973-75. On the contrary, The Vietnam War already weakened the United States
    relative to its Japanese and German rivals. The costs of that war obliged the United
    States to abandon the fixed exchange rates and the institutional mechanisms established at
    Bretton Woods, and then to devalue the dollar. </p>
    <p>For American economic power, it has been downhill ever since. President Reagan's
    recklessness and &quot;Reaganomics&quot; [which in good time George Bush himself baptized
    as &quot;Voodoo Economics&quot;] put the American economy at the mercy of Japanese bankers
    and German industrialists. It is even more at their mercy for financial and political
    support during the new recession, which began in 1989-90 before the crisis in the Gulf,
    and then during the war in the Gulf itself. Any severe and prolonged recession would still
    sink the American economy and President Bush. Unfortunately, the President would take many
    innocent people - and a few of his not so innocent sycophants - down with him. </p>
    <p>At home in the United States, the Gulf War distracted attention from the deepening
    recession. That may have been another one of its purposes, particularly in distracting
    public opinion from increasing bankruptcies and unemployment. However on the policy making
    level, this diversion of needed attention from the recession may have been a short sighted
    or even ostrich policy. It can become can become costly in the middle run, if it lets the
    recession get all the moreso out of hand. Moreso, because even without the distraction of
    the war, the U.S. government and Federal Reserve have scarce anti-cyclical economic policy
    instruments left to combat recession. Most measures to stem the recessionary tide at home,
    like lowering the rate of interest as the Fed did in early 1991, only open the floodgates
    even more to a lower dollar and reduce or reverse the capital flows from abroad, which the
    American economy also needs to remain afloat. The debates about how war and victory affect
    domestic consumer confidence or spending and therefore the outlook for recession or
    recovery are largely beside the point. They are largely attempts to blame the recession on
    the war, while if there is any such causation, it is the other way around from the
    recession to the war. The main recessionary forces were both prior to and independent of
    the war; and, as observed above, they may have given President Bush an additional impulse
    to go to war. </p>
    <p>Probably more important than the wartime or postwar confidence of consumers at home in
    the United States, is the confidence of international capital and of allied governments
    elsewhere in the West. The more important effects of the recession and war will play
    themselves out via the reactions of private capital and the decisions by governments and
    central banks in Europe and Japan. Still during the war, the German [Central] Bundesbank,
    and following it per force the Dutch and some others, already followed the US interest
    rate decline by raising their own rates of interest, to the dismay of the more recession
    ridden United States, Britain and France. The fixed exchange rates within the European
    Monetary System were brought under pressure, the dollar immediately plunged, and capital
    was attracted to Germany. As usual, the intervention of the central banks to shore up the
    dollar was to no avail. The Bundesbank president defended his decision by saying that he
    was contributing to &quot;stability&quot; in fighting against inflation in Germany, which
    is Europe's most important -- but also still most healthy - economy. Let the Devil take
    the hindmost! True, the dollar rose again against the mark after the American victory in
    the war and the revelation of the costs of German unification. And then the dollar began
    to decline again. Its and American fortunes remain unstable at best. </p>
    <p>So, how long will the Japanese and the Europeans, other than the British with their
    &quot;special relationship&quot; but most depressed economy, continue to lend a helping
    hand of private and public funds to support the American War in the Gulf and the American
    economy at home? That is the question. For without foreign active political and material
    economic support, the United States no longer has the domestic economic base even to
    finance this war, let alone to build a &quot;New World Order&quot; of its own design. </p>
    <p>&quot;A Victor in War, U.S. Is Pinned Down on Economic Front&quot; is the front page
    headline, whose story quotes a British diplomat </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>There's no question after, the Gulf war, that the U.S. is the only superpower in the
      world. It is also clear, however, that there are limits to that power, particularly in the
      economic arena (IHT, April 22, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>After another week of American-German disputes about interest rates and other economic
    policies </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a final lesson of the week's events is the vivid contrast between the leverage America
      still has in high politics of war and peace, compared to its deepening impotence to
      dictate economic policy. In the Gulf conflict, the United States was able not only to win
      broad support from its allies ... but when Washington needed allied support for its
      economic strategy, it was politely but firmly rebuffed (Robert Kuttner, IHT May 3, 1991). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Walter Russell Mead correctly observed in the International Herald Tribune (Feb
    7,1991): </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>At a time of diminishing national resources and power, the United States has not
      lowered its foreign policy horizons, it has universalized them. The mirage of universal
      alliance against instability, led but not paid for by America is potentially the most
      dangerous idea in U.S. foreign policy in the last generation. It raises expectations that
      cannot be met....It tempts American to take on responsibilities beyond their resources.
      While they want the post- Cold War order to evolve in [New World Order] ways that defend
      American primacy, America's associates want it to diminish. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There is the rub! The Soviet Union never had the economic clout to support its claim to
    being a super power. Now it is being downgraded into the position of an over-armed Third
    world/rate power. The United States was long obsessed with its political and ideological
    security in [successfully] defeating the Soviet Union in the cold war. In so doing, the
    United States neglected to maintain its real economic base in competition with its real
    competitors in Japan and Europe. So now the United States no longer has sufficient
    economic clout to be a super power either. </p>
    <p>Yet with President Bush waiving the American flag, the United States rushed in where
    angels fear to tread. It rushed into War in the Gulf in a probably vain attempt to shore
    up its declining power on the world stage one last time by the only means it has left and
    knows how to use - its military power. However, without an adequate economic base,
    military power is insufficient to keep a great super power afloat. On the contrary, the
    foolish use of its military power may instead sink that power. It is not for nothing that
    Paul Kennedy became a best seller [apparently not in the Bush White House or the Pentagon]
    when he wrote that foolish military overextension beyond the economy's means to support it
    is the basis of The Rise and FALL of the Great Powers. </p>
    <h4>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h4>
    <p>Beyond the people directly cited in the text, for this consolidation and extension of
    my four earlier essays on the Gulf War cited below, I benefited by reading Praful Bidwai,
    Noam Chomsky, Craig Hulet, Holly Sklar, and Joe Stork. I gleaned general information and
    some data from them, which is not exclusive to them or did not seem specific enough to
    cite or ascribe to them directly. Marta Fuentes and Barry Gills helped me by critiquing an
    earlier draft. </p>
    <h4>REFERENCES CITED</h4>
    <p>A.G. Frank earlier writings on the Gulf crisis and war used to prepare the present
    essay. The previous essays were published in several languages; but where English was
    among them, only that version is mentioned here. </p>

<p><b><i>Gules a Cross potent quadrate within a Bordure Argent charged with eight Torteaux.</i></b><br><br>
The Diocese of Mercia was created by Bishop Diuma in around 656 and the see was settled in Lichfield in 669 by the then bishop, Ceadda. During the 9th century, the diocese was devastated by the Vikings. Lichfield itself was unwalled and had become rather poor, so Bishop Peter moved the see to the fortified and wealthier Chester in 1075. His successor, Robert de Limesey, transferred it to Coventry and the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. In 1539 the see was transferred back to Lichfield and the name was reversed to become the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry. In 1837 Coventry was transferred to the Diocese of Worcester. The current diocese was formed in 1918 from part of the Diocese of Worcester and the arms combined the cross potent quadrate of Lichfield with the torteaux of Worcester.</p>

<p><b><i>Azure a Cross Or between four Lions rampant Argent.</i></b><br><br>
These arms appears first on the seal of Robert Nevill, Bishop of Durham from 1438 to 1457. The lions are possibly derived from the arms of the great Thomas Hatfield, bishop from 1345 to 1381, whose seal contains his arms, a cheveron between three lions. This shield, with the field red and the cross and lions silver, has been found, it is said, as the ensign of S. Denys, bishop and martyr. It is worthy of note that the Bishop of Durham is the only prelate in England who should use a mitre having a coronet about its rim. This distinction belongs to him, and to him alone, a sign of the palatinate authority which until 1835 was exercised by the occupants of the see.</p>

Bishop William de Luda is found using these arms as early as 1290. They are those assigned to S. Etheldreda, Queen of Northumbria and founder of the Abbey of Ely, in whose honour the cathedral church is dedicated. The reverse, <i>Or three Ducal Coronets two and one Gules</i>, are the arms of St. Osyth, Queen of the East Saxons and founder of a nunnery at Chick in Essex, who was murdered by the Danes about the year 676.</p>

<p><b><i>Gules three Leopards' Faces reversed jessant-de-Lis two and one Or.</i></b><br><br>
These are base on the arms of the powerful House of Cantilupe from which came Thomas de Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford from 1275 to 1282. Adam Orlton, the next bishop but one after him, had two such fleurs-de-lis engraved in his seal, and after his time these arms came to be regarded as the arms of the See.
The leopards' heads are usually drawn reversed, but there is good reason for believing that they are nothing more than a decorative elaboration of the ball or knop from which the leaves of the flowers spring. The earliest examples of the arms of Cantilupe show three golden fleurs-de-lis on red, and the seal of a fifteenth-century Bishop of Hereford gives them in the shield of the See with very large plain knops. But usage has decided that the knops shall be leopards' heads reversed, and it is as well, no doubt, to conform to the usual practice.</p>

<p><b><i>Per pale Gules and Argent a Cross potent quadrate between four Crosses formy all counterchanged.</i></b><br><br>
No satisfactory explanation is known of these ancient and remarkable arms, which in the Middle Ages were devised for St. Chad, Bishop of Mercia, and patron of the cathedral.
The shield is equally divided by the perpendicular line and coloured red and silver, the red being on the spectator's left hand. The large cross, similarly divided, is coloured red where it rests on the silver, and silver in its other half. The four small crosses are treated in the same way, those in the red half being silver while the two in the silver are red. The central cross is of unusual form. Its arms issue from a square and end in crutch-shaped pieces, whence its name "potent",  from the French <i>potence</i> - a crutch.</p>

The red saltire is in allusion to St. Andrew in whose honour the cathedral was originally dedicated. The reason for the golden scallop is lost.</p>

This is the most usual form of these ancient arms, borne in memory of the saints in whose honour the cathedral is dedicated. The manner in which the charges are arranged has varied from time to time, but the field is consistently coloured red, the keys set back to back with their bows interlaced are always gold and silver, and it is always the golden key which lies over the blade of the sword.</p>

<p><b><i>Argent ten Torteaux four three two one.</i></b><br><br>
These arms are not, as is sometimes said, those of Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester from 1268 to 1302. This shield with the red roundels is found in a fourteenth-century seal of the Hospital of St. Wulstan at Worcester. He was made Bishop of Worcester in the time of Edward the Confessor and lived into the reign of William Rufus. In the Middle Ages his name is found among those of the saints in whose honour the cathedral was dedicated, and the memory of this great-hearted and patriotic bishop was greatly cherished there. The shield was perhaps devised to commemorate some forgotten deed of his.
Thomas Peverell (1407-19) is the first Bishop of Worcester whose seal is known to have contained these arms as representing the See.</p>

Edmund, the last King of East Anglia, was murdered by the Danes in the year 870, who scourged him and shot him to death with arrows when at a meeting with the invaders, he refused to share his kingdom with their chief. The charges in the arms, which are blue and gold like those of other Saxon kings, refer to his kingship and his martyrdom. The great abbey at Bury which grew up round St. Edmund's shrine had for its arms three like crowns and pairs of arrows on a blue field.</p>

There he was discovered, so it is related, by the King of France while hunting, who having tracked a wounded hind found that she had taken refuge in the hermit's cell. St. Giles is the patron saint of the woodland, hence the shield is coloured green.</p>

<p><b><i>Azure three Escallops two and one Or.</i></b><br><br>
The scallop shell, the ancient emblem of St. James, seems to have been assigned to him by the Spaniards who revered him as their patron and protector. A scallop was worn as a sign by all pilgrims who had been to Compostela in Galicia where the shrine of the saint was. The Spanish knightly order of St. James was founded in memory of the Battle of Clavijo, where, it is said, the patron of Spain appeared, sword in hand, to fight against the Moors with the trappers of his war-horse powdered with scallops. The badge of that famous order is a red sword with a silver scallop upon the hilt. It is thought that the scallop may have been chosen as St. James's emblem in memory of his having been a fisherman.</p>

Leonard, the patron saint of prisoners and slaves, was a hermit of France who lived in the sixth century. He founded an abbey near Limoges and spent his long life in works of pity, being specially tender towards those who had lost their liberty. The Benedictines claimed him as one of their order, and the black field of these arms is a reminder of the colour of their habit. The golden chain with its broken fetters is intended to typify the freeing of captives which was St. Leonard's dearest form of charity.</p>

The birds are black with red legs and beaks. The arms of the City of Canterbury, three choughs and a chief with a leopard of England, are engraved in its fifteenth-century'seal. It is hardly likely that Archbishop Thomas himself actually bore arms, but the choughs were certainly regarded as St. Thomas's birds in the Middle Ages. If there is any legend to account for this it is no longer remembered.</p>

<p><b><i>Or seven Mascles conjoined three three one Gules.</i></b><br><br>
This shield has been regarded as St. Wilfrid's since the fifteenth century at least. It is not easy to say why it was assigned, to him, or wherein is its appropriateness. Perhaps, however, it is more than fancy which sees in this reticulated charge some suggestion of a fishing-net. For Wilfrid was not only a great fisher of men. The tale of how in the days of his banishment he showed the starving Sussex folk the plenteous store of food that the sea held for them is well known. Perhaps too in the seven sharp summits of the lozenges of his shield there may be a hint of Wilfrid's devotion to the See of Rome, as if those points referred to the seven hills of the eternal city.</p>

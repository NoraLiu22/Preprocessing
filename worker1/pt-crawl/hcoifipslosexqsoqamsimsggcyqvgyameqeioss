<p>The arms are based on those granted to the previous East Sussex CC on 10th September 1937. In 1974 the County Boroughs of Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings were added to the county and part transferred to West Sussex. The white wavy bar was added for difference to reflect the changes, as any change of area or population by 10% meant that the arms of a predecessor meant the arms could no longer be used.<br>
The medieval heralds assigned arms consisting of six gold martlets on blue to the ancient Kingdom of the South Saxons. The martlet is a mythical bird, an heraldic generalization for various kinds of birds, but in this case probably represents the swallow. It is shown at rest, with its wings closed and without feet. This last characteristic led to stories about the martlet or swallow spending its entire life in flight, unable to land on the ground!<br> One theory is that martlets were used because of the influence of the Lords of Arundel in county affairs; in French swallow is <i>hirondelle</i>, having been suggestive of the name of Arundel, the Honour which formed a large part of Sussex. Another possibility is that a number of early Sussex families used martlets on their arms and that a sheriff of Sussex from one of these families simply transferred them from his personal coat of arms to his official seal for county business. Blue and red shields with six golden martlets were already shown representing Sussex in 1611.<br>
The gold crown represents the South Saxons and the red background provides a contrast to the blue background of the similat West Sussex CC arms granted in 1889.</p>

<p>The white horse on a red field is reputed to be the symbol of the ancient Saxon kingdom of Kent; they have for long been associated with the modern County.<br>
The mural crown commemorates the fact that, for four hundred years, Kent was an independent Saxon kingdom. Its form is also symbolic of the many fortified castles and towns in the county and the masts and sails are emblems of its intimate links with the Navy, the Mercantile Marine and Sea Fisheries.<br>
The sea lions are symbolic of the support that Kentish seaman have given to the sea-power of England through the centuries and the fact that the long coastline of Kent is part of England�s frontier with continental Europe. From the collar of one sea lion is suspended a shield bearing the Arms of the Cinque Ports, which had an obligation to provide substantial support for the naval forces of England until modern times. Four of the Cinque Ports are in Kent. From the collar of the other sea lion is suspended a shield bearing the Arms of the Archbishopric of Canterbury, founded by St Augustine who landed in Kent in AD 597. Canterbury is the primary See of the English Church.<br>
The long serving motto is an allusion to the belief that Kent has kept its boundaries intact since pre-Roman times and that its people had "reserved to themselves and their posterity, their ancient Customs and Liberties" (Richard Kilburn 1659). The motto is on a ribbon the colour of which is as near as possible to the time - honoured Kentish Grey, a colour of significance in the days of the weaving industry in Kent.</p>

<p>The current arms replaced those granted in 1934, since the changes in local government in 1965 and 1974 meant the area and population of the County had altered greatly since the original grant. The main colours of the field are the same as those of the <a href="surrey_ob.html#surrey former">former arms</a>, where the blue, and also the gold parts, are derived from the arms of the Warrennes, ancient Earls of Surrey. The black is suggested by the fields of the arms of the Borough's of Guildford and Godalming. The keys are from the arms of the Abbey of St. Peter at Chertsey, once a powerful and extensive landowner in Surrey. Keys also appear in the arms of the <a href="ecclesiastical.html#winchester see">See of Winchester</a>, which formerly included much of the County, they also form part of the arms of the present See of Guildford. The sprig of oak also from the former arms, represents the County's extensive rural areas and is derived from the badge of the FitzAlans, one time Earls of Surrey. It also appears in the mouths of the supporters of the Duke of Norfolk, the current Earl of Surrey. The woolpack is a reminder of the importance of the wool trade in the past, and is also included for that reason in the arms of numerous towns and boroughs in the County.</p>

Similar arms, but with a straight edge, had been granted to the former County Council in 1889. However in 1974 West Sussex was enlarged by the addition of parts of East Sussex and Surrey. As a result the enlarged County Council sought a new coat of arms.<br>
The Saxon crown is taken from the arms of East Sussex CC, and an allusion to the ancient Kingdom of the South Saxons. The oak leaves and acorns are taken from the arms of Surrey CC and were added to represent the newly-acquired areas. The original straight edge to the gold chief was made into a jagged, tooth-like edge with five indents. These represented the five districts, or parts of districts, which were formerly part of East Sussex and Surrey - Burgess Hill, Cuckfield, East Grinstead, Dorking and Horley. Later Dorking and Horley transferred back to Surrey leaving only Gatwick Airport from Surrey in West Sussex.</p>

<p>The white background with two wavy blue bars represents the sea and Sussex coastline, and the gold key symbolises authority. The embattled green chief, as in the arms of the <a href="w_sussex.html#arundel tc">Borough of Arundel</a>, resembles the battlements of a tower or castle, and as such are allusive not only of Arundel Castle, a prominent feature in the neighbourhood, but of local government in general. The martlets recall those in these arms of the County, <a href="w_sussex.html#bognor regis tc">Bognor Regis UDC</a> and <a href="w_sussex.html#littlehampton tc">Littlehampton UDC</a>, and being known in French as 'hirondelle', they allude by a play on words, to Arundel, the historic town on the River Arun, from which the District Council takes its name. They are five in number, to represent the five former amalgamated areas.<br>
The Saxon crown recalls the history of the area and county prior to the Conquest. The round tower is again, a symbol of local government, a tower, like one of those of Arundel Castle, has been depicted arising from within the Saxon Crown, thereby forming with the latter a simple but very distinctive device which links past and present.<p></td></tr>

<p>The gold background suggests the richness and fertility of the "Garden of England", and the three sprigs of ash represent the three former Ashford areas. Each sprig has five leaves to indicate the five former authorities comprising the present Borough, and the wavy line suggesting the rivers Stour, Rother and Beult. The lion joined to the hulk of a medieval ship is from the ancient arms of the Cinque Ports, and is taken from the sail of the ship in the arms of the Borough of Tenterden. It indicates the historical importance of Tenterden as a member of the Confederation, and its green background suggests the Tenterden Rural District surrounding the former Borough.<br>
The white and red of the wreath, are the colours of the Kent County Council arms, and of the device of the Ashford UDC, red also being the background of the Tenterden arms. The white horse is that of Kent, and was seen in the device of the Ashford UDC and the medallion of the East Ashford RDC. The leaved hop-cone symbolizes agriculture and the driving wheel recalls the locomotive "lnvicta", which was a feature of the Ashford UDC device and indicated the importance of the town as a railway centre.<br>
The motto is a phase adapted from a poem by Richard Lovelace, the famous 17th century poet and a member of the Lovelace family of Bethersden in the former West Ashford Rural District. It appropriately expresses the aspirations and determination of the Borough Council.</p>

<p>The cross signifies the importance of Crawley's position at the junction of the London to Brighton and Horsham to East Grinstead roads. The nine martlets are from the traditional arms of the South Saxons, and feature in many civic arms in Sussex. Their gold colour on the blue background gives the Sussex colours, and their number suggests the nine communities which made up the original Crawley New Town. The acorns commemorate the oak forests which once covered so much of North Sussex, and also symbolise strong steady growth.<br> 
The wreath and mantling are blue and white, the main colours of the arms. The palisaded crown relates to the circlet of palisades in the Crawley Development Corporation's crest and is an emblem of a planned area. The royal lion, brandishing a hammer, symbolises Manor Royal industrial estate.<br> 
The Borough of Crawley includes the important international airport at Gatwick, so the supporters are an eagle with its wings raised, and, because Gatwick is a British airport, a winged lion. The silver fretty - the criss-crossed area within the wings - represents Crawley industry, with the silver colour suggesting the steel and aluminium it uses. The two red thunderbolts, held by the lion and the eagle, represent the town's flourishing electrical industry.<br> 
The motto is a translation of a phrase from Seneca's Epistulae and refers to the establishment of a happy, expanding community.</p>

<p>The chevron represents the bridge over the River Darent, from which the town of Dartford and the Parish of Darenth took their names. The three golden discs represent the three constituent councils, while their tabloid form, as those in the arms of the former <a href="kent_ob.html#dartford fbc">Borough of Dartford</a>, represents the pharmaceutical industries of the area. The millrinds, like those in the arms of the Dartford RDC, portray the milling of flour and agricultural engineering. The jester's head in a fool's cap, also from the former Borough's arms, symbolises the paper industry, founded in Dartford during the reign of Elizabeth I, and the two sacks represent the cement manufactured at Swanscombe.<br>
The ancient galley, from the arms of the Rural District, is a reminder of the past Roman civilisation of the district with its many villas and burial grounds and the present shipping industry, it is shown here with seven oars representing  the seven communities (Dartford and the six parishes) which form the Borough. It also recalls one of those seen from Galley Hill sailing up the Thames, past the creek which led to Southfleet, whose church is dedicated to St. Nicholas, patron of mariners. The lightning over the galley stands for the electricity produced at Littlebrook Power Station on the banks of the Thames at Stone, whose parish church was known as the "Lantern of Kent" from its beacon light known to all sailors on the river.<br>
The Lion of England is a reminder of Dartford's royal history. King Henry III's sister was married to the Holy Roman Emperor by proxy in Gundulf's Church on the Darent, and Anne of Cleves lived in the Tudor Manor House, which was later used by Elizabeth I as a royal residence. The staff sybolises the priory founded by Edward III, it also brings to mind the Hermits of the Ford, the Martyrs of the Brent and other holy men and women who kept the faith alive in this part of Kent, while the anvil represents the engineering industries, that occupy the lands of the old priory. The white horse of Kent is from the arms of the County Council, and the long hammer is the symbol of Wat Tyler, by tradition a citizen of Dartford, who led the Kentish peasants in a revolt against unjust taxes, while the wheatsheaf represents agriculture. The Maltese crosses represent the Knights of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, whose commandery was at Sutton-at-Hone.<br>
The motto is adapted from the school song "Floreat Dartfordia" written by S.J. Steane, a Dartford citizen and former master for Dartford Grammar School, which was founded in the reign of Elizabeth I.</p>

<p>The division of the shield is suggested by the chevron in the arms of the <a href="surrey_ob.html#esher udc">Esher UDC</a>, this was derived from the arms of the d'Abernons, the colours blue and gold are from the arms of the Warennes, Earls of Surrey, the Surrey County Council and the arms of both constituent authorities. The two sprigs of oak like those in the County's arms signify two Surrey authorities. The elm on a bridge is an obvious reference to the name of the Borough, derived from the ancient Hundred of Elmbridge, which was largely coterminious with the present Borough. The bridge has two arches for the union of two authorities and the waves refer to the rivers Thames, Mole, Wey and Ember.<br>
The gold Saxon crown from the crest of the <a href="surrey_ob.html#walton and weybridge udc">Walton and Weybridge UDC</a>, refers to the Saxon Hundred of Elmbridge, whose Moot was held at the bridge over the River Mole. The mound represents Esher Common, on which stands the white griffin from the Esher arms, derived from the arms of the Evelyns of Wotton, Cardinal Wolsey and the Reeds of Oatlands. The nine pointed star on the pennon symbolizes the union of nine civil parishes in the Borough.<br>
The supporters combine the white eagle from the arms of Esher with the red eagle from the arms of Walton and Weybridge. In the former, it was derived from the arms of Merton Priory, landowners in Molesey for four centuries, and in the later it refered to the area's Roman associations. The sprigs of elm with two leaves are a further reference to the two former authorities and the Tudor roses are from the arms of Walton and Weybridge.<br>
The motto is a variation of that previously used by Walton and Weybridge UDC.</p>

The gold mural is symbolic of local government and the lion is repeated from the arms, here shown between two lilies, which allude to the dedication of the Parish Church of St Mary's.

<p>The golden lion and border of blue and gold checks are taken from the former arms of the <a href="e_sussex.html#lewes tc">Borough of Lewes</a> and reflect the influence of the Fitzalan and de Warenne families respectively. William de Warenne was after the Norman Conquest granted the Rape of Lewes (one of the Anglo-Saxon divisions of the ancient Kingdom of Sussex into six administrative areas). His family held the Barony of Lewes until 1347 when, the last male member of the de Warenne family died leaving, as his heiress, a sister who had married a Fitzalan, and whose son. Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, became Lord of the Barony of Lewes, Before the Barony of Lewes came to them, the coat of arms of the Fitzalan family consisted of a gold lion on a red background, but it appears that thereafter they were drawn to show the de Warenne gold and blue chequers on the left hand side of the shield and the gold lion on a red background on the right hand side. The lion's hindquarters have been replaced with a sea lion's tail to symbolise the coastal and maritime interest of the District.<br>
The black eagle is taken from the arms originally borne by the d'Aquila family, Lords of the Manor of Seaford. The eagle appeared on the 13th century seal of the ancient Borough of Seaford and formed part of the arms of the <a href="e_sussex.html#seaford tc">Seaford UDC</a>. The eagle wears a golden collar from which is suspended a golden anchor - the principal emblem of the badge of the Newhaven Town Council and former Urban District Council. The Saxon Crown is derived from the arms of the <a href="e_sussex.html#east sussex cc">East Sussex County Council</a> and this recognises not only that Lewes District is within the administrative county of East Sussex, but that the County Town of Lewes is the centre of justice and the seat of local administration.<p></td></tr>

<p>The blue and white wave represents the River Mole, with the two Dorking areas on one side and the Leatherhead area on the other. The acorns are from the arms of the three former auithorities and the Surrey County Council. Above the acorns are two stylised hills, representing Box Hill and Leith Hill, two notable geographical features of the district, with a blue sky above. The outline of the hills also suggests the letter M with a V in the middle.<br>
The crest's basic colours of gold and blue, the traditional Surrey livery, are taken from the arms of the Warrennes, first Earls of Surrey. The mural crown, is a familiar symbol of local government, coloured white as in the crest of the <a href="surrey_ob.html#dorking udc">Dorking UDC</a> and a direct reference to the prevalence of Dorking Lime in many local buildings. The swan was prominent in the crest of the <a href="surrey_ob.html#leatherhead udc">Leatherhead UDC</a>, in which it alluded to the old Swan Inn of coaching days and to the river and other local waters. The swan holds in its beak a red sword pointing upwards, refering to the association with the City of London through the City Freeman's School and to the connection between the former arms and the Second World War, the Leatherhead arms being the first in heraldry to commemorate the unity of purpose of the Civil Defence Services. Flanking the swan are two branches of oak leaves linking with the oak in the shield and are a direct reference to the former Leatherhead crest and the County arms.<br>
The two cocks are of the distinctive five-toed Dorking breed, and are taken from the Dorking UDC crest, they characterise the surrounding rural area. Each cock holds in its beak a pine cone from the crest of the <a href="surrey_ob.html#dorking and horley rdc">Dorking and Horley RDC</a>, they refer to the Weald and Leith Hill wooded area of the district.<br>

<p>As in the arms of the <a href="surrey_ob.html#reigate bc">Borough of Reigate</a>, the background is the blue and gold chequers of the Warrennes, Earls of Surrey, Lords of Reigate and founders of the Priory in medieval times. The old device of the gate and oak tree is from the former seal and arms of Reigate, in the new arms the device is shown in its proper colours instead of white. The black chief, also from the old Reigate arms, is charged with the simple device of the Banstead UDC, the gold woolpack. It refers to the former importance of sheep-rearing and wool-production in Banstaad and also to the historic Wodpack Inn. The two sprigs of oak, as in the Surrey CC arms, refer to the two Surrey parishes of Horley and Salfords & Sidlow.<br>
The mantling is in the basic Surrey colours of the Warrennes, blue and gold. The half length figure of one of the Pilgrim supporters of the former Reigate BC arms, is an obvious reference to the ancient Pilgrims' Way, which is common to both Reigate and Banstead.<br>
The white lion and horse, are the supporters of the Howards, late Earls of Surrey. The lion was the crest of the Reigate BC in reference to the Lords Howard of Effingham, later Lords of Reigate. This was derived from the white lion of the de Mowbrays, who were prominent in Banstead and held the manor in the 12th century, so the lion is appropriate to both places. The horse is also a reference to the tradition of horse-racing on Banstead Downs, starting in the 17th century and immortalised in the famous Oaks race. The heraldic fountains on the shoulders indicate the River Mole at both Horley and Sidlow bridge. The tanner's knife, the ancient emblem of <a href="ecclesiastical.html#st bartholomew">St. Bartholomew</a>, patron of the parish of Horley, alludes to one of its ancient crafts, the leather industry. It is possible that the choice of this saint for the dedication of the church was due to the importance of this craft in ancient times. The sallow-leaf, refers to the name Salfords, the derivation of which is usually "sallow ford".<br>
The motto is that used by the former Reigate BC.</p>

The blue waves refer to the River Thames<br>
The crest recalls, like that of the <a href="surrey_ob.html#chertsey udc">Chertsey UDC</a>, the Benedictine Abbey of St. Peter at Chertsey. Its founding in 666 started the recorded history of the entire area, for its lands and influence extended over the whole of this part of Surrey.

<p>The lion joined to the hulk of a medieval ship is the long established device from the arms of the Cinque Ports and reflects the District's historic association with that Confederation. The ancient ship is a further reference to the region's maritime nature, and is based on the kind of vessels shown on the seals of the former ancient boroughs of Hythe, Lydd and New Romney and the ancient Town of Folkestone, and thus generally represents them and their history. The six double roses, stand for the six constituent parts which composed the District, roses being particularly suitable, as they suggest the Garden of England as Kent is known.<br>
The grassy mount symbolizes farming, and can also be regarded as referring to the former Elham Rural District. The black double headed eagle is from the crest of  the <a href="weald_downs.html#folkestone tc">Borough of Folkstone</a>, derived from the attributed arms of Julius Caesar, who according to legend landed near Folkestone. The crosier represents St. Eanswyth, one of supporters of the Folkstone arms and the heart on its breast refers to Dr. William Harvey, discoverer of the circulatory system, who was born in Folkstone and whose figure was also a supporter of the town's arms.<br>

<p>The vertical division of the background into blue and black is like the arms of the Surrey County Council. A chief was common the the arms of both former authorities, divided into gold and white like the shield of Chertsey Abbey which, being connected with the history of the whole area, was commemorated in the arms of both former councils; the <a href="surrey_ob.html#bagshot rdc">Bagshot RDC</a> had the gold and white backgrouind, while the <a href="surrey_ob.html#frimley and camberley udc">Frimley and Camberley UDC</a> had the keys and sword of St Peter and St Paul, shown here on the on the gold and white chief. The crossed swords, interlaced with the antlers of a stag's head, are derived from the principal emblems in the previous councils' arms, the crossed swords of the Army badge indicating the importance of the Royal 
Military Academy at Sandhurst and the Staff College at Camberley and the former military camp at Chobham. The stag's head alludes to Bagshot Park, a royal demesne since Norman times, and to the fact that much of the district was formerly part of Windsor Forest. The interlacing of the swords with the antlers symbolises the union of the two districts.<br>
The wreath and mantling are in the principal colour and metal of the arms, blue and gold, the ancient liveries of the Warenne Earls of Surrey and of the County Council. The circle of fir cones from the crest of Bagshot RDC encloses a mound of heathland in reference to Bagshot Heath. The the royal lion from the Bagshot arms, is crowned with a red crown like the Stanhope lion in the crest of the Frimley and Camberly UDC, the latter holds a grenade or fire-ball, and this is shown in the royal lion's forepaw.<br>
The white owl is derived from one the three in the Frimley and Camberley
shield, alluding to the le Marchant baronets of Chobham, one of whom was first Lieutenant-Governor of the Royal Military College. As in the former shield, the owl stands on a sprig of oak, the Surrey badge. The falcon is derived from the crest of Bagshot, here it reverts to its original function as a supporter, being that of the Earls of Onslow. Each is wreathed about the neck with livery colours of the arms of the two former councils, white and blue for Frimley and Camberley, gold and red for Bagshot.<br>
The motto is derived from those of Onslow and Bagshot, and its import here is the ideal of progress with speed and efficiency.</p>

<p>The arms are made up of elements derived from the heraldry of past holders of the Manor of Woking. The cross is from the arms attributed to Edward the Confessor and the red and gold colouring is from the arms of Bassett family, to whom the manor was granted by King John, shortly after his accession. On the death of Aliva Bassett in 1281, the Manor passed to her son Hugh le Despenser, and it is from the Despenser family arms that the frets are taken. The fleurs-de-lis are from the arms of the Beaufort Dukes of Somerset, who came into possesion of the Manor in 1416. Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, lived at Woking Palace and her grandson, Henry VIII, also live there from time to time.</p>

<p>A thirteenth-century seal of the Barons of Faversham � from a very early date a limb of the Cinque Ports � bears the three lions of England on a shield. Round the arms on the seal is the Latin inscription �Regis ut arma rego libera portus ego� - in English, �Since I [Faversham} bear arms for the King without charge, I am a free port�. This suggests that in return for the town�s services to the King, he granted it the privilege of using his Royal arms, without variation, as its own. In 1933 it was noted that no grant of arms to the then Borough of Faversham had survived in the official records. However a 1619 source was cited, that suggested that the three lions� hind-quarters should be in silver, not gold. In 1988 the Borough�s successor, the Town Council, sought resolution of the conflict between this version and the earlier one with the College of Arms. The outcome was that in 1990 the College confirmed the current version, but the actual effect is that Faversham is using the arms of the great Irish family of O'Brien. The reverse of the seal bears a ship with a banner on which are the three chevrons of Clare.</p>

<p>The woolpack, taken from an earlier seal, indicates the subsistance of the Town upon the woollen industry for several centuries. The rose indicates that the first Borough Charter was granted in Tudor times, in 1575 during the reign of Elizabeth I. The three pears, are a punning rubus in reference to the Borough's first Warden John Perrier, a clothier. The other shield is said to refer to Sir George More of Loseley, who held the Manor of Godalming from 1601 after it passed from royal hands. However the shield bears no resemblance to the arms of More, and it seems likely that this shield was originally intended to represent Jocelyn de Bohun, Bishop of Salisbury in 1157, when the holding of Rectory Manor by the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury was confirmed. Unfortunately, this Bishop Jocelyn has been confused with another man with a similar name, Jocelyn de Bailleul, whose arms may be regarded as having some resemblance to the device used in the Godalming arms.<br>

The lions were probably derived from the Royal Arms, another suggestion is that the shield was originally meant to show the arms of Hainault in honour of Queen Philippa. Edward III married Philippa of Hainault in 1327.</p>

<p>The lymphad or ancient ship is similar to one on Seaford�s original corporation seal, a reminder of the town�s former status as a port. The "lion-hulks" (half lion and half ship) appear in the arms or badges of many Cinque Ports member towns, and here serves as a reminder that Seaford for some hundreds of years was associated with the group as a �limb� of Hastings. The eagle, also represented on the old town seal, comes from the arms of the d'Aquila family who owned land hereabouts in medieval times.<p></td></tr>

<p>The seven golden acorns refer to the name sevenoaks and were previously used on the unofficial arms used by the Council. Its design was very similar to the arms believed to have been borne by William Sevenoke, the founder of Sevenoaks School, in the 15th century and still used by that school as "Founder's Arms". The blue Y-shaped pall is suggested by the arms of the Archbishops of Canterbury, who held the Manor of Sevenoaks as part of that of Otford. It also represents the the road junction, which was a major factor in the development of the town. The colours of gold and red are also the main colours of the arms of the Sackville family, who owned Knole House in Sevenoaks for many centuries.<br>
The silver circlet with red lozenges are taken from the arms of Bosville, a notable local family. The white horse is from the arms attributed to the ancient Kingdom of Kent and now borne by the Kent County Council. The lance is similar to those in the crest of the Amherst family and the vine is a reference to the historic Vines cricket ground in Sevenoaks and is also said to suggest another local family, Lambard, who owned Vine Court.<br>
The badge conbines the seven golden acorns from the arms with a silver estoile, from the crest of the Sackville family. Here the rays are increased to seven to fit with the acorns.</p>

On the reverse of the same seal, beneath a figure of St Mildred, the Patron of the town, is a shield bearing the arms which appear on the mizzen of the ship in the town arms.

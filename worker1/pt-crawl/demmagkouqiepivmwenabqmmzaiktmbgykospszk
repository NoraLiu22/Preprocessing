<p>Teesside University hosts a unique research unit dedicated to the study of the far right and its opposition.</p>


<p>It examines the historical development of far right politics and culture since its inception in the early twentieth century.</p>

<p>Some of the themes the centre aims to explore include:</p>
<ul><li>the contemporary far-right, especially since 9/11, and anti-Muslim politics</li>
<li>‘tit for tat extremism’ and how the reactions of radical groups only seek to fuel more hatred and violence</li>
<li>the role of the internet and other new media technologies in far-right radicalisation.</li></ul>

<h2>Renowned experts at the forefront of research</h2>

<p> The centre is led by Professor Nigel Copsey and Professor  Matthew Feldman and will build upon their reputations as two of the leading UK experts on both historical and contemporary manifestations of fascism and (radical) anti-fascism.</p>

<p>Professor Copsey has a long-standing research interest in right-wing extremism, fascism and anti-fascism. He has published widely on the history of anti-fascism in Britain, the nature of anti-fascist activity and the British National Party and its quest for legitimacy.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170824222929im_/http://www.tees.ac.uk/Images/Schools/SAM/Copsey.jpg" align="right" class="imgright" alt="Nigel Copsey" width="200" height="150" border="0">Professor  Feldman is an expert on fascist ideology and the contemporary far-right in Europe and the USA.  He has written widely on these subjects, as well as on the interaction between politics and faith in the modern world.</p>

<p>Professor  Feldman has featured on various radio and television programmes, as well as national and international newspapers and websites discussing high profile cases such as Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway and the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich.</p>

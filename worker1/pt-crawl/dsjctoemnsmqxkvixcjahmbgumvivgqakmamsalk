    <td><big><strong>I. PANTHEISM, NATURALISM AND ABSOLUTE RATIONALISM</strong></big><p>1.
    There exists no Supreme, all-wise, all-provident Divine Being, distinct from the universe,
    and God is identical with the nature of things, and is, therefore, subject to changes. In
    effect, God is produced in man and in the world, and all things are God and have the very
    substance of God, and God is one and the same thing with the world, and, therefore, spirit
    with matter, necessity with liberty, good with evil, justice with
    injustice.&#151;Allocution &quot;Maxima quidem,&quot; June 9, 1862.</p>
    <p>2. All action of God upon man and the world is to be denied.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>3. Human reason, without any reference whatsoever to God, is the sole arbiter of truth
    and falsehood, and of good and evil; it is law to itself, and suffices, by its natural
    force, to secure the welfare of men and of nations.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>4. All the truths of religion proceed from the innate strength of human reason; hence
    reason is the ultimate standard by which man can and ought to arrive at the knowledge of
    all truths of every kind.&#151;Ibid. and Encyclical &quot;Qui pluribus,&quot; Nov. 9,
    1846, etc.</p>
    <p>5. Divine revelation is imperfect, and therefore subject to a continual and indefinite
    progress, corresponding with the advancement of human reason.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>6. The faith of Christ is in opposition to human reason and divine revelation not only
    is not useful, but is even hurtful to the perfection of man.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>7. The prophecies and miracles set forth and recorded in the Sacred Scriptures are the
    fiction of poets, and the mysteries of the Christian faith the result of philosophical
    investigations. In the books of the Old and the New Testament there are contained mythical
    inventions, and Jesus Christ is Himself a myth.</p>
    <p><big><strong>II. MODERATE RATIONALISM</strong></big></p>
    <p>8. As human reason is placed on a level with religion itself, so theological must be
    treated in the same manner as philosophical sciences.&#151;Allocution &quot;Singulari
    quadam,&quot; Dec. 9, 1854.</p>
    <p>9. All the dogmas of the Christian religion are indiscriminately the object of natural
    science or philosophy, and human reason, enlightened solely in an historical way, is able,
    by its own natural strength and principles, to attain to the true science of even the most
    abstruse dogmas; provided only that such dogmas be proposed to reason itself as its
    object.&#151;Letters to the Archbishop of Munich, &quot;Gravissimas inter,&quot; Dec. 11,
    1862, and &quot;Tuas libenter,&quot; Dec. 21, 1863.</p>
    <p>10. As the philosopher is one thing, and philosophy another, so it is the right and
    duty of the philosopher to subject himself to the authority which he shall have proved to
    be true; but philosophy neither can nor ought to submit to any such authority.&#151;Ibid.,
    Dec. 11, 1862.</p>
    <p>11. The Church not only ought never to pass judgment on philosophy, but ought to
    tolerate the errors of philosophy, leaving it to correct itself.&#151;Ibid., Dec. 21,
    1863.</p>
    <p>12. The decrees of the Apostolic See and of the Roman congregations impede the true
    progress of science.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>13. The method and principles by which the old scholastic doctors cultivated theology
    are no longer suitable to the demands of our times and to the progress of the
    sciences.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>14. Philosophy is to be treated without taking any account of supernatural
    revelation.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p><big><strong>III. INDIFFERENTISM, LATITUDINARIANISM</strong></big></p>
    <p>15. Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light
    of reason, he shall consider true.&#151;Allocution &quot;Maxima quidem,&quot; June 9,
    1862; Damnatio &quot;Multiplices inter,&quot; June 10, 1851.</p>
    <p>16. Man may, in the observance of any religion whatever, find the way of eternal
    salvation, and arrive at eternal salvation.&#151;Encyclical &quot;Qui pluribus,&quot; Nov.
    9, 1846.</p>
    <p>17. Good hope at least is to be entertained of the eternal salvation of all those who
    are not at all in the true Church of Christ.&#151;Encyclical &quot;Quanto
    conficiamur,&quot; Aug. 10, 1863, etc.</p>
    <p>18. Protestantism is nothing more than another form of the same true Christian
    religion, in which form it is given to please God equally as in the Catholic
    Church.&#151;Encyclical &quot;Noscitis,&quot; Dec. 8, 1849.</p>
    <p><big><strong>IV. SOCIALISM, COMMUNISM, SECRET SOCIETIES, BIBLICAL SOCIETIES,
    CLERICO-LIBERAL SOCIETIES</strong></big></p>
    <p>Pests of this kind are frequently reprobated in the severest terms in the Encyclical
    &quot;Qui pluribus,&quot; Nov. 9, 1846, Allocution &quot;Quibus quantisque,&quot; April
    20, 1849, Encyclical &quot;Noscitis et nobiscum,&quot; Dec. 8, 1849, Allocution
    &quot;Singulari quadam,&quot; Dec. 9, 1854, Encyclical &quot;Quanto conficiamur,&quot;
    Aug. 10, 1863.</p>
    <p><big><strong>V. ERRORS CONCERNING THE CHURCH AND HER RIGHTS</strong></big></p>
    <p>19. The Church is not a true and perfect society, entirely free- nor is she endowed
    with proper and perpetual rights of her own, conferred upon her by her Divine Founder; but
    it appertains to the civil power to define what are the rights of the Church, and the
    limits within which she may exercise those rights.&#151;Allocution &quot;Singulari
    quadam,&quot; Dec. 9, 1854, etc.</p>
    <p>20. The ecclesiastical power ought not to exercise its authority without the permission
    and assent of the civil government.&#151;Allocution &quot;Meminit unusquisque,&quot; Sept.
    30, 1861.</p>
    <p>21. The Church has not the power of defining dogmatically that the religion of the
    Catholic Church is the only true religion.&#151;Damnatio &quot;Multiplices inter,&quot;
    June 10, 1851.</p>
    <p>22. The obligation by which Catholic teachers and authors are strictly bound is
    confined to those things only which are proposed to universal belief as dogmas of faith by
    the infallible judgment of the Church.&#151;Letter to the Archbishop of Munich, &quot;Tuas
    libenter,&quot; Dec. 21, 1863.</p>
    <p>23. Roman pontiffs and ecumenical councils have wandered outside the limits of their
    powers, have usurped the rights of princes, and have even erred in defining matters of
    faith and morals.&#151;Damnatio &quot;Multiplices inter,&quot; June 10, 1851.</p>
    <p>24. The Church has not the power of using force, nor has she any temporal power, direct
    or indirect.&#151;Apostolic Letter &quot;Ad Apostolicae,&quot; Aug. 22, 1851.</p>
    <p>25. Besides the power inherent in the episcopate, other temporal power has been
    attributed to it by the civil authority granted either explicitly or tacitly, which on
    that account is revocable by the civil authority whenever it thinks fit.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>26. The Church has no innate and legitimate right of acquiring and possessing
    property.&#151;Allocution &quot;Nunquam fore,&quot; Dec. 15, 1856; Encyclical
    &quot;Incredibili,&quot; Sept. 7, 1863.</p>
    <p>27. The sacred ministers of the Church and the Roman pontiff are to be absolutely
    excluded from every charge and dominion over temporal affairs.&#151;Allocution
    &quot;Maxima quidem,&quot; June 9, 1862.</p>
    <p>28. It is not lawful for bishops to publish even letters Apostolic without the
    permission of Government.&#151;Allocution &quot;Nunquam fore,&quot; Dec. 15, 1856.</p>
    <p>29. Favours granted by the Roman pontiff ought to be considered null, unless they have
    been sought for through the civil government.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>30. The immunity of the Church and of ecclesiastical persons derived its origin from
    civil law.&#151;Damnatio &quot;Multiplices inter,&quot; June 10, 1851.</p>
    <p>31. The ecclesiastical forum or tribunal for the temporal causes, whether civil or
    criminal, of clerics, ought by all means to be abolished, even without consulting and
    against the protest of the Holy See.&#151;Allocution &quot;Nunquam fore,&quot; Dec. 15,
    1856; Allocution &quot;Acerbissimum,&quot; Sept. 27, 1852.</p>
    <p>32. The personal immunity by which clerics are exonerated from military conscription
    and service in the army may be abolished without violation either of natural right or
    equity. Its abolition is called for by civil progress, especially in a society framed on
    the model of a liberal government.&#151;Letter to the Bishop of Monreale &quot;Singularis
    nobisque,&quot; Sept. 29, 1864.</p>
    <p>33. It does not appertain exclusively to the power of ecclesiastical jurisdiction by
    right, proper and innate, to direct the teaching of theological questions.&#151;Letter to
    the Archbishop of Munich, &quot;Tuas libenter,&quot; Dec. 21, 1863.</p>
    <p>34. The teaching of those who compare the Sovereign Pontiff to a prince, free and
    acting in the universal Church, is a doctrine which prevailed in the Middle
    Ages.&#151;Apostolic Letter &quot;Ad Apostolicae,&quot; Aug. 22, 1851.</p>
    <p>35. There is nothing to prevent the decree of a general council, or the act of all
    peoples, from transferring the supreme pontificate from the bishop and city of Rome to
    another bishop and another city.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>36. The definition of a national council does not admit of any subsequent discussion,
    and the civil authority car assume this principle as the basis of its acts.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>37. National churches, withdrawn from the authority of the Roman pontiff and altogether
    separated, can be established.&#151;Allocution &quot;Multis gravibusque,&quot; Dec. 17,
    1860.</p>
    <p>38. The Roman pontiffs have, by their too arbitrary conduct, contributed to the
    division of the Church into Eastern and Western.&#151;Apostolic Letter &quot;Ad
    Apostolicae,&quot; Aug. 22, 1851.</p>
    <p><big><strong>VI. ERRORS ABOUT CIVIL SOCIETY, CONSIDERED BOTH IN ITSELF AND IN ITS
    RELATION TO THE CHURCH</strong></big></p>
    <p>39. The State, as being the origin and source of all rights, is endowed with a certain
    right not circumscribed by any limits.&#151;Allocution &quot;Maxima quidem,&quot; June 9,
    1862.</p>
    <p>40. The teaching of the Catholic Church is hostile to the well- being and interests of
    society.&#151;Encyclical &quot;Qui pluribus,&quot; Nov. 9, 1846; Allocution &quot;Quibus
    quantisque,&quot; April 20, 1849.</p>
    <p>41. The civil government, even when in the hands of an infidel sovereign, has a right
    to an indirect negative power over religious affairs. It therefore possesses not only the
    right called that of &quot;exsequatur,&quot; but also that of appeal, called
    &quot;appellatio ab abusu.&quot;&#151;Apostolic Letter &quot;Ad Apostolicae,&quot; Aug.
    22, 1851</p>
    <p>42. In the case of conflicting laws enacted by the two powers, the civil law
    prevails.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>43. The secular Dower has authority to rescind, declare and render null, solemn
    conventions, commonly called concordats, entered into with the Apostolic See, regarding
    the use of rights appertaining to ecclesiastical immunity, without the consent of the
    Apostolic See, and even in spite of its protest.&#151;Allocution &quot;Multis
    gravibusque,&quot; Dec. 17, 1860; Allocution &quot;In consistoriali,&quot; Nov. 1, 1850.</p>
    <p>44. The civil authority may interfere in matters relating to religion, morality and
    spiritual government: hence, it can pass judgment on the instructions issued for the
    guidance of consciences, conformably with their mission, by the pastors of the Church.
    Further, it has the right to make enactments regarding the administration of the divine
    sacraments, and the dispositions necessary for receiving them.&#151;Allocutions &quot;In
    consistoriali,&quot; Nov. 1, 1850, and &quot;Maxima quidem,&quot; June 9, 1862.</p>
    <p>45. The entire government of public schools in which the youth- of a Christian state is
    educated, except (to a certain extent) in the case of episcopal seminaries, may and ought
    to appertain to the civil power, and belong to it so far that no other authority
    whatsoever shall be recognized as having any right to interfere in the discipline of the
    schools, the arrangement of the studies, the conferring of degrees, in the choice or
    approval of the teachers.&#151;Allocutions &quot;Quibus luctuosissimis,&quot; Sept. 5,
    1851, and &quot;In consistoriali,&quot; Nov. 1, 1850.</p>
    <p>46. Moreover, even in ecclesiastical seminaries, the method of studies to be adopted is
    subject to the civil authority.&#151;Allocution &quot;Nunquam fore,&quot; Dec. 15, 1856.</p>
    <p>47. The best theory of civil society requires that popular schools open to children of
    every class of the people, and, generally, all public institutes intended for instruction
    in letters and philosophical sciences and for carrying on the education of youth, should
    be freed from all ecclesiastical authority, control and interference, and should be fully
    subjected to the civil and political power at the pleasure of the rulers, and according to
    the standard of the prevalent opinions of the age.&#151;Epistle to the Archbishop of
    Freiburg, &quot;Cum non sine,&quot; July 14, 1864.</p>
    <p>48. Catholics may approve of the system of educating youth unconnected with Catholic
    faith and the power of the Church, and which regards the knowledge of merely natural
    things, and only, or at least primarily, the ends of earthly social life.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>49. The civil power may prevent the prelates of the Church and the faithful from
    communicating freely and mutually with the Roman pontiff.&#151;Allocution &quot;Maxima
    quidem,&quot; June 9, 1862.</p>
    <p>50. Lay authority possesses of itself the right of presenting bishops, and may require
    of them to undertake the administration of the diocese before they receive canonical
    institution, and the Letters Apostolic from the Holy See.&#151;Allocution &quot;Nunquam
    fore,&quot; Dec. 15, 1856.</p>
    <p>51. And, further, the lay government has the right of deposing bishops from their
    pastoral functions, and is not bound to obey the Roman pontiff in those things which
    relate to the institution of bishoprics and the appointment of bishops.&#151;Allocution
    &quot;Acerbissimum,&quot; Sept. 27, 1852, Damnatio &quot;Multiplices inter,&quot; June 10,
    1851.</p>
    <p>52. Government can, by its own right, alter the age prescribed by the Church for the
    religious profession of women and men; and may require of all religious orders to admit no
    person to take solemn vows without its permission.&#151;Allocution &quot;Nunquam
    fore,&quot; Dec. 15, 1856.</p>
    <p>53. The laws enacted for the protection of religious orders and regarding their rights
    and duties ought to be abolished; nay, more, civil Government may lend its assistance to
    all who desire to renounce the obligation which they have undertaken of a religious life,
    and to break their vows. Government may also suppress the said religious orders, as
    likewise collegiate churches and simple benefices, even those of advowson and subject
    their property and revenues to the administration and pleasure of the civil
    power.&#151;Allocutions &quot;Acerbissimum,&quot; Sept. 27, 1852; &quot;Probe
    memineritis,&quot; Jan. 22, 1855; &quot;Cum saepe,&quot; July 26, 1855.</p>
    <p>54. Kings and princes are not only exempt from the jurisdiction of the Church, but are
    superior to the Church in deciding questions of jurisdiction.&#151;Damnatio
    &quot;Multiplices inter,&quot; June 10, 1851.</p>
    <p>55. The Church ought to be separated from the .State, and the State from the
    Church.&#151;Allocution &quot;Acerbissimum,&quot; Sept. 27, 1852.</p>
    <p><big><strong>VII. ERRORS CONCERNING NATURAL AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS</strong></big></p>
    <p>56. Moral laws do not stand in need of the divine sanction, and it is not at all
    necessary that human laws should be made conformable to the laws of nature and receive
    their power of binding from God.&#151;Allocution &quot;Maxima quidem,&quot; June 9, 1862.</p>
    <p>57. The science of philosophical things and morals and also civil laws may and ought to
    keep aloof from divine and ecclesiastical authority.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>58. No other forces are to be recognized except those which reside in matter, and all
    the rectitude and excellence of morality ought to be placed in the accumulation and
    increase of riches by every possible means, and the gratification of pleasure.&#151;Ibid.;
    Encyclical &quot;Quanto conficiamur,&quot; Aug. 10, 1863.</p>
    <p>59. Right consists in the material fact. All human duties are an empty word, and all
    human facts have the force of right.&#151;Allocution &quot;Maxima quidem,&quot; June 9,
    1862.</p>
    <p>60. Authority is nothing else but numbers and the sum total of material
    forces.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>61. The injustice of an act when successful inflicts no injury on the sanctity of
    right.&#151;Allocution &quot;Jamdudum cernimus,&quot; March 18, 1861.</p>
    <p>62. The principle of non-intervention, as it is called, ought to be proclaimed and
    observed.&#151;Allocution &quot;Novos et ante,&quot; Sept. 28, 1860.</p>
    <p>63. It is lawful to refuse obedience to legitimate princes, and even to rebel against
    them.&#151;Encyclical &quot;Qui pluribus,&quot; Nov. 9, 1864; Allocution &quot;Quibusque
    vestrum,&quot; Oct. 4, 1847; &quot;Noscitis et Nobiscum,&quot; Dec. 8, 1849; Apostolic
    Letter &quot;Cum Catholica.&quot;</p>
    <p>64. The violation of any solemn oath, as well as any wicked and flagitious action
    repugnant to the eternal law, is not only not blamable but is altogether lawful and worthy
    of the highest praise when done through love of country.&#151;Allocution &quot;Quibus
    quantisque,&quot; April 20, 1849.</p>
    <p><big><strong>VIII. ERRORS CONCERNING CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE</strong></big></p>
    <p>65. The doctrine that Christ has raised marriage to the dignity of a sacrament cannot
    be at all tolerated.&#151;Apostolic Letter &quot;Ad Apostolicae,&quot; Aug. 22, 1851.</p>
    <p>66. The Sacrament of Marriage is only a something accessory to the contract and
    separate from it, and the sacrament itself consists in the nuptial benediction
    alone.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>67. By the law of nature, the marriage tie is not indissoluble, and in many cases
    divorce properly so called may be decreed by the civil authority.&#151;Ibid.; Allocution
    &quot;Acerbissimum,&quot; Sept. 27, 1852.</p>
    <p>68. The Church has not the power of establishing diriment impediments of marriage, but
    such a power belongs to the civil authority by which existing impediments are to be
    removed.&#151;Damnatio &quot;Multiplices inter,&quot; June 10, 1851.</p>
    <p>69. In the dark ages the Church began to establish diriment impediments, not by her own
    right, but by using a power borrowed from the State.&#151;Apostolic Letter &quot;Ad
    Apostolicae,&quot; Aug. 22, 1851.</p>
    <p>70. The canons of the Council of Trent, which anathematize those who dare to deny to
    the Church the right of establishing diriment impediments, either are not dogmatic or must
    be understood as referring to such borrowed power.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>71. The form of solemnizing marriage prescribed by the Council of Trent, under pain of
    nullity, does not bind in cases where the civil law lays down another form, and declares
    that when this new form is used the marriage shall be valid.</p>
    <p>72. Boniface VIII was the first who declared that the vow of chastity taken at
    ordination renders marriage void.&#151;Ibid.</p>
    <p>73. In force of a merely civil contract there may exist between Christians a real
    marriage, and it is false to say either that the marriage contract between Christians is
    always a sacrament, or that there is no contract if the sacrament be excluded.&#151;Ibid.;
    Letter to the King of Sardinia, Sept. 9, 1852; Allocutions &quot;Acerbissimum,&quot; Sept.
    27, 1852, &quot;Multis gravibusque,&quot; Dec. 17, 1860.</p>
    <p>74. Matrimonial causes and espousals belong by their nature to civil
    tribunals.&#151;Encyclical &quot;Qui pluribus,&quot; Nov. 9 1846; Damnatio
    &quot;Multiplices inter,&quot; June 10, 1851, &quot;Ad Apostolicae,&quot; Aug. 22, 1851;
    Allocution &quot;Acerbissimum,&quot; Sept. 27, 1852.</p>
    <p><big><strong>IX. ERRORS REGARDING THE CIVIL POWER OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF</strong></big></p>
    <p>75. The children of the Christian and Catholic Church are divided amongst themselves
    about the compatibility of the temporal with the spiritual power.&#151;&quot;Ad
    Apostolicae,&quot; Aug. 22, 1851.</p>
    <p>76. The abolition of the temporal power of which the Apostolic See is possessed would
    contribute in the greatest degree to the liberty and prosperity of the
    Church.&#151;Allocutions &quot;Quibus quantisque,&quot; April 20, 1849, &quot;Si semper
    antea,&quot; May 20, 1850.</p>
    <p><big><strong>X. ERRORS HAVING REFERENCE TO MODERN LIBERALISM</strong></big></p>
    <p>77. In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be
    held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of
    worship.&#151;Allocution &quot;Nemo vestrum,&quot; July 26, 1855.</p>
    <p>78. Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons
    coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar
    worship.&#151;Allocution &quot;Acerbissimum,&quot; Sept. 27, 1852.</p>
    <p>79. Moreover, it is false that the civil liberty of every form of worship, and the full
    power, given to all, of overtly and publicly manifesting any opinions whatsoever and
    thoughts, conduce more easily to corrupt the morals and minds of the people, and to
    propagate the pest of indifferentism.&#151;Allocution &quot;Nunquam fore,&quot; Dec. 15,
    1856.</p>
    <p>80. The Roman Pontiff can, and ought to, reconcile himself, and come to terms with
    progress, liberalism and modern civilization.&#151;Allocution &quot;Jamdudum
    cernimus,&quot; March 18, 1861.</p>

      <i>The following paragraphs, although often appended to </i>The<i> </i>Syllabus<i>,
      actually derive from the encyclical of 21 November 1873,&nbsp; </i><a href="/web/20180102165127/http://www.ewtn.com/library/encyc/p9etsimu.htm">Etsi

    <p>The faith teaches us and human reason demonstrates that a double order of things
    exists, and that we must therefore distinguish between the two earthly powers, the one of
    natural origin which provides for secular affairs and the tranquillity of human society,
    the other of supernatural origin, which presides over the City of God, that is to say the
    Church of Christ, which has been divinely instituted for the sake of souls and of eternal
    salvation.... The duties of this twofold power are most wisely ordered in such a way that
    to God is given what is God's (Matt. 22:21), and because of God to Caesar what is
    Caesar's, who is great because he is smaller than heaven. Certainly the Church has never
    disobeyed this divine command, the Church which always and everywhere instructs the
    faithful to show the respect which they should inviolably have for the supreme authority
    and its secular rights....</p>
    <p>.... Venerable Brethren, you see clearly enough how sad and full of perils is the
    condition of Catholics in the regions of Europe which We have mentioned. Nor are things
    any better or circumstances calmer in America, where some regions are so hostile to
    Catholics that their governments seem to deny by their actions the Catholic faith they
    claim to profess. In fact, there, for the last few years, a ferocious war on the Church,
    its institutions and the rights of the Apostolic See has been raging.... Venerable
    Brothers, it is surprising that in our time such a great war is being waged against the
    Catholic Church. But anyone who knows the nature, desires and intentions of the sects,
    whether they be called masonic or bear another name, and compares them with the nature the
    systems and the vastness of the obstacles by which the Church has been assailed almost
    everywhere, cannot doubt that the present misfortune must mainly be imputed to the frauds
    and machinations of these sects. It is from them that the synagogue of Satan, which
    gathers its troops against the Church of Christ, takes its strength. In the past Our
    predecessors, vigilant even from the beginning in Israel, had already denounced them to
    the kings and the nations, and had condemned them time and time again, and even We have
    not failed in this duty. If those who would have been able to avert such a deadly scourge
    had only had more faith in the supreme Pastors of the Church! But this scourge, winding
    through sinuous caverns, . . . deceiving many with astute frauds, finally has arrived at
    the point where it comes forth impetuously from its hiding places and triumphs as a
    powerful master. Since the throng of its propagandists has grown enormously, these wicked
    groups think that they have already become masters of the world and that they have almost
    reached their pre-established goal. Having sometimes obtained what they desired, and that
    is power, in several countries, they boldly turn the help of powers and authorities which
    they have secured to trying to submit the Church of God to the most cruel servitude, to
    undermine the foundations on which it rests, to contaminate its splendid qualities; and,
    moreover, to strike it with frequent blows, to shake it, to overthrow it, and, if
    possible, to make it disappear completely from the earth. Things being thus, Venerable
    Brothers, make every effort to defend the faithful which are entrusted to you against the
    insidious contagion of these sects and to save from perdition those who unfortunately have
    inscribed themselves in such sects. Make known and attack those who, whether suffering
    from, or planning, deception, are not afraid to affirm that these shady congregations aim
    only at the profit of society, at progress and mutual benefit. Explain to them often and
    impress deeply on their souls the Papal constitutions on this subject and teach, them that
    the masonic associations are anathematized by them not only in Europe but also in America
    and wherever they may be in the whole world.</p>
    <p><strong>To the Archbishops and Bishops of Prussia concerning the situation of the
    Catholic Church faced with persecution by that Government....</strong></p>
    <p>But although they (the bishops resisting persecution) should be praised rather than
    pitied, the scorn of episcopal dignity, the violation of the liberty and the rights of the
    Church, the ill treatment which does not only oppress those dioceses, but also the others
    of the Kingdom of Prussia, demand that We, owing to the Apostolic office with which God
    has entrusted us in spite of Our insufficient merit, protest against laws which have
    produced such great evils and make one fear even greater ones; and as far as we are able
    to do so with the sacred authority of divine law, We vindicate for the Church the freedom
    which has been trodden underfoot with sacrilegious violence. That is why by this letter we
    intend to do Our duty by announcing openly to all those whom this matter concerns and to
    the whole Catholic world, that these laws are null and void because they are absolutely
    contrary to the divine constitution of the Church. In fact, with respect to matters which
    concern the holy ministry, Our Lord did not put the mighty of this century in charge, but
    Saint Peter, whom he entrusted not only with feeding his sheep, but also the goats;
    therefore no power in the world, however great it may be, can deprive of the pastoral
    office those whom the Holy Ghost has made Bishops in order to feed the Church of God. </p>

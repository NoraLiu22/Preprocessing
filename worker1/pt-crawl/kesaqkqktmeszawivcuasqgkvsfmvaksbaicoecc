    <p> For the preventing and removeing of errour and offence that may
      grow and spread in any of the Churches in this Jurisdiction, And
      for the preserveing of trueith and peace in the severall churches
      within themselves, and for the maintenance and exercise of
      brotherly communion, amongst all the churches in the Countrie, It
      is allowed and ratified, by the Authoritie of this Generall Court
      as a lawfull libertie of the Churches of Christ. That once in
      every month of the yeare (when the season will beare it) It shall
      be lawfull for the minesters and Elders, of the Churches neere
      adjoyneing together, with any other of the breetheren with the
      consent of the churches to assemble by course in each severall
      Church one after an other. To the intent after the preaching of
      the word by such a minister as shall be requested thereto by the
      Elders of the church where the Assembly is held, The rest of the
      day may be spent in publique Christian Conference about the
      discussing and resolveing of any such doubts and cases of
      conscience concerning matter of doctrine or worship or government
      of the church as shall be propounded by any of the Breetheren <b>[Page


        277]</b> of that church, will leave also to any other Brother to
      propound his objections or answeres for further satisfaction
      according to the word of god. Provided that the whole action be
      guided and moderated by the Elders of the Church where the
      Assemblie is helde, or by such others as they shall appoint. And
      that no thing be concluded and imposed by way of Authoritie from
      one or more churches upon an other, but onely by way of Brotherly
      conference and consultations. That the trueth may be searched out
      to the satisfying of every mans conscience in the sight of god
      according his worde. And because such an Assembly and the worke
      thereof can not be duely attended to if other lectures be held in
      the same weeke. It is therefore agreed with the consent of the
      Churches. That in that weeke when such an Assembly is held, All
      the lectures in all the neighbouring Churches for that weeke shall
      be forborne. That so the publique service of Christ in this more
      solemne Assembly may be transacted with greater deligence and
      attention. </p>
    <p> 96. Howsoever these above specified rites, freedomes Immunities,
      Authorites and priveledges, both Civill and Ecclesiastical are
      expressed onely under the name and title of Liberties, and not in
      the exact forme of Laws or Statutes, yet we do with one consent
      fullie Authorise, and earnestly intreate all that are and shall be
      in Authoritie to consider them as laws, and not to faile to
      inflict condigne and proportionable punishments upon every man
      impartiallie, that shall infringe or violate any of them. </p>

    <p> 98. Lastly because our dutie and desire is to do nothing

      <div style="text-align: left;"><b>[Page 278]</b> In the first year
        that Deputies from the towns took their place in the General
        Court, "John Winthrop and Richard Bellingham, Esq. [March 4,
        1635] were desired by the Court to take a view of all orders
        already made and to inform the next General Court which of them
        they judged meet to he altered, abbreviated, repealed,
        corrected, enlarged, or explained, &amp;c. (Mass. Rec., I. 137.)
        The General Court came together May 6, and the business
        remaining undone, the Governor [Haynes], Deputy Governor
        [Bellingham], John Winthrop, and Thomas Dudley, Esq., were
        deputed by the Court to make a draft of such laws as they should
        judge needful for the well-ordering of this plantation, and to
        present the same to the Court." (Ibid., 147; comp. Winthrop, I.
        160.) </div>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> A year passed. Another General Court
        assembled; and "the Governor [Vane], Deputy-Governor [Winthrop],
        Thomas Dudley, John Haynes, Richard Bellingham, Esq., Mr.
        Cotton, Mr. Peter, and Mr. Shepard were entreated [May 25, 1636]
        to make a draft of laws agreeable to the word of God, which
        might be the fundamentals of this Commonwealth, and to present
        the same to the next General Court." (Mass. Rec., I. 174.)
        Provisionally "the Magistrates and their associates" were to
        "proceed in the Courts to hear and determine all causes
        according to the laws now established; and where there is no
        law, then as near the law of God as they can. The public
        attention was distracted by the Pequot war and the Antinomian
        controversy. Haynes was just going away; the young Governor had
        already enough upon his hands; and others of the commission had
        no heart for the business. Cotton held a ready pen, and loved a
        various activity. At the time appointed he was all prepared, and
        "did present a copy of Moses his judicials, compiled in an exact
        method, which were taken into further consideration till the
        next General Court." (Winthrop, I. 202.) It was probably easy
        for the quietists to persuade the Court that it would be
        scarcely decorous for them to act when one only of their
        committee had given his advice. </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> Two years had followed since their
        last action, and the freemen, . . . patient, but tenacious of
        their purpose, tried the virtue of a more formal method (March
        12, 1638), and "ordered that the freemen of every town (or some
        part thereof chosen by the rest) within this jurisdiction shall
        assemble together in their several towns, and collect the heads
        of such necessary and fundamental laws as may he suitable to the
        times and places where God by his providence hath cast us, and
        the heads of such laws to deliver in writing to the Governor for
        the time being before the 5th day of the 4th month, called June,
        next, to the intent that the same Governor, together with the
        rest of the Standing Council, and Richard Bellingham, Esq., Mr.
        Bulkley, Mr. Phillips, Mr. Peter, and Mr. Shepard, elders of
        several churches, Mr. Nathaniel Ward, Mr. William Spencer, and
        Mr. William Hathorne, or the major part of them, may, upon the
        survey of such heads of laws, make a compendious abridgment of
        the same by the <b>[Page 279]</b> General Court in autumn next,
        adding yet to the same or detracting therefrom what in their
        wisdoms shall seem meet, so that, the whole work being perfected
        to the best of their skill, it may be presented to the General
        Court for confirmation or rejection, as the Court shall
        adjudge." </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> Fifteen months came and went, but
        "most of the magistrates and some of the elders were not forward
        in the matter" (Winthrop, I. 322); and the General Court. . .
        was fain to order (June 6, 1639) "that the Marshal shall give
        notice to the Committee about the body of laws, to send unto the
        next General Court such drafts of laws as they had prepared, for
        the Court to take order about them what to settle." (Mass. Rec.,
        I. 262.) </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> Still the coveted object did but
        mock their hopes with the show of having been approached. The
        tactics of delay were inexhaustible. Some "drafts of laws"
        indeed came in (two only, as far as we know,---Cotton's and
        Ward's); but the best that their friends could get done for them
        was an order (November 5, 1639) that "the Governor [Winthrop],
        Deputy-Governor [Dudley], Treasurer [Bellingham], and Mr.
        Stoughton, or any three of them; with two or more of the
        Deputies of Boston, Charlestown, or Roxbury, shall peruse all
        those models which have been, or shall be, further presented to
        this Court, or themselves, concerning a form of government and
        laws to be established, and shall draw them up into one body
        (altering, adding, or omitting what they shall think fit), and
        shall take order that the same shall be copied out and sent to
        the several towns, that the elders of the churches and the
        freemen may consider of them against the next General Court."
        (Ibid., 279.) And the case must have seemed to be getting
        well-nigh desperate, when, six months later yet (May 13, 1640),
        in consideration that "a breviate of laws was formerly sent
        forth to be considered by the elders of the churches and other
        freemen of this Commonwealth," it was "desired that they would
        endeavor to ripen their thoughts and counsels about the same by
        the General Court in the next eighth month." (Ibid., 292.) "The
        next eighth month" accomplished no more than its predecessors.
        The Court met, but the question was kept out of notice. </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> It came to be differently treated,
        when, on the one hand, from several years' experience, the
        characteristics of a useful jurisprudence had at length
        disclosed themselves, and, on the other, Parliament was crowding
        on the King, and in Massachusetts the fear of impending
        hostility from England was dying away. There had probably grown
        up a sincere disposition among the guides of public action to
        meet the popular wish for a legal code, when (June 2, 1641), in
        the place of an interminable consultation of the towns, the
        service of a learned lawyer was enlisted, and "the Governor
        [Bellingham] was appointed to peruse all the laws, and take
        notice of what may be fit to be repealed, what to be rectified,
        what to stand, and make return to the next General Court."
        (Ibid., 320.) And when, sufficient time having been allowed for
        this examination, "the Governor and Mr. Hathorne were desired
        [October 7] to speak to Mr. Ward for a copy of the Liberties and
        of the Capital Laws to be transcribed and sent to the several
        towns" (Ibid., 341), the order may be held to indicate a general
        desire in high quarters that the Deputies might next come
        together prepared for definitive action in favor of his code.
        The session of the General Court which adopted this vote was
        continued by adjournments more than two months. And that the
        project of a Statute-Book, and of Ward's in particular, was
        still gaining favor, may be inferred from the passage of an
        order (December 10) by which "Mr. Deputy Endicott, Mr. Downing,
        <b>[Page 280]</b> and Mr. Hathorne are authorized to get
        nineteen copies of the laws, liberties, and the forms of oaths
        transcribed and subscribed by their several hands, and none to
        be authentic but such as they subscribe, and to be paid for by
        the constable of each town, ten shillings apiece for each copy,
        and to be prepared within six weeks." (Ibid., 344.) At length,
        in a session which "continued three weeks" (in December), the
        General Court "established the hundred laws which were called
        The Body of Liberties. They . . . had been revised and altered
        by the Court, and sent forth into every town to be further
        considered of, and now again in this Court they were revised,
        amended, and presented." (Winthrop, II. 55.) </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    A MS. copy of "The Body of Liberties" of the Massachusetts Colony,
    the first code of laws established in New England, and therefore in
    a very real sense our "Magna Charta," was discovered in the Boston
    Athenaeum by Francis C. Gray, and published in the Collections of
    the Massachusetts Historical Society, Third Series, vol. viii., in
    1843; and the student should read Gray's valuable essay on the Early
    Laws of Massachusetts accompanying it. He shows the absurdity of
    prevalent notions that the first Massachusetts code was deduced
    almost literally from the Books of Moses. On the contrary, the code
    evinces not only the fathers' "acknowledged love of liberty," but a
    noteworthy degree of "practical good sense in legislation and
    liberality of sentiment." The code was far in advance of the time.
    <p> In 1889 William H. Whitmore printed the MS. discovered by Mr.
      Gray in facsimlie in the introduction to his reprint of the
      "Colonial Laws of the Massachusetts Colony," and again with his
      "Bibliographical Sketch" of those laws, which is worthy of careful
      study. </p>
    <p> A significant defence of the early Massachusetts laws, prepared
      by a committee including Winthrop, Dudley, and Bellingham, was
      embodied in a declaration of the General Court in 1646 concerning
      a remonstrance of Robert Child, Thomas Fowle, Samuel Maverick, and
      others against certain features of this legislation. This
      Declaration, which includes parallels between "The Body of
      Liberties" and Magna Charta and the Common Law of England, is
      printed in Hutchinson's "Original Papers relative to
      Massachusetts," 1760, pp. 196-218, following the remonstrance.
      There is much concerning this in Winthrop's History (vol. ii.),
      the section covering 1646. See Barry's History of Mass., i. 275,
      Palfrey, etc. </p>
    <p> Nathaniel Ward, the compiler of "The Body of Liberties," was
      born about 1578 at Haverhill in England, and was the son of Rev.
      John Ward, an eminent Puritan minister. He was graduated at
      Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1603, studied law, and became a
      barrister. Travelling extensively on the Continent, he met at
      Heidelberg the celebrated writer, David Pareus, who induced him to
      enter the ministry. He served as a clergyman for a time at Elbing
      in Prussia, then returning to England, lecturing in London, and
      then settling in Essex, where he became a Puritan leader, and in
      1631 was brought before Laud. In 1634 he came to New England, and
      became the colleague of Rev. Thomas Parker at Ipswich. After two
      years, owing to feeble health, he resigned his pastorate, but
      continued to reside at Ipswich. Here he compiled "The Body of
      Liberties," which was adopted by the General Court of
      Massachusetts in December, 1641. In 1646 he published "The simple
      Cobbler of Agawam," which at once became so famous. See the review
      of it and of Ward's general work by Professor Moses Coit Tyler in
      his "History of American Literature"; also by Rev. T. Franklin
      Waters in his edition of "The Simple Cobbler." Returning to
      England in 1647, Ward became minister of the church at Shenfield
      in Essex, where he remained until his death in 1652. His sermon
      before the House of Commons in 1647 and various writings relating
      to the conflicts of that stormy time in England were published.
      Probably few of his associates in New England had legal abilities
      and training superior to his. "I have read almost all the common
      Law of England," he says in his "simple Cobbler"; and this was
      clearly the main source of the Massachusetts "Body of Liberties."
      In the defence of the Massachusetts laws by the authorized
      committee of the colony in 1646, referred to above, these laws are
      compared only with Magna Charta and the Common Law of England.<br>

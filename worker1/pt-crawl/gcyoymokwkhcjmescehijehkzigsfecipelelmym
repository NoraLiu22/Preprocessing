<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The President of the Republic of Palau and Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, H.ETommy E. <span data-scayt_word="Remengesau" data-scaytid="1" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Remengesau</span> Jr.advised that on Wednesday 22 October Fiji&rsquo;s suspension from the Forum was lifted.</p>
<p align="left">
&ldquo;I requested the Forum Secretariat to deliver my letter addressed to the Prime Minister of Fiji, the Hon. Rear Admiral (<em>Retired</em>) <span data-scayt_word="Josaia" data-scaytid="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Josaia</span> <span data-scayt_word="Voreqe" data-scaytid="3" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Voreqe</span> <span data-scayt_word="Bainimarama" data-scaytid="4" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Bainimarama</span> conveying the decision of the Forum Leaders to fully lift the suspension of Fiji from the Forum forthwith.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">
&ldquo;Forum Leaders were unanimous in their decision to lift Fiji&rsquo;s suspension from the Forum based on a recommendation to Leaders by the Forum Ministerial Contact Group (MCG) on Fiji. Leaders had earlier requested the MCG to make a recommendation to them following the election in Fiji regarding its readmission to the Forum based on an assessment of the report of the Multinational Observer Group and any other factors the MCG wishes to take into account.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">
&ldquo;Forum Leaders fully welcomed and accepted the recommendation of the Forum Ministerial Contact Group and very much look forward to Fiji&rsquo;s participation and contribution in all Forum activities, including the meetings of the Forum Leaders. I thank and acknowledge the Forum Ministerial Contact Group on Fiji for its steadfast commitment and hard work,&rdquo; added the Forum Chair.</p>
<p align="left">
&ldquo;I offer again our warm congratulations to the newly elected Government of Prime Minister <span data-scayt_word="Bainimarama" data-scaytid="5" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Bainimarama</span> and commend the people of Fiji for their full participation in the historic election of their leaders and representatives, culminating in results that reflect the will and mandate of the Fijian people. &rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">
Speaking on behalf of the Forum Secretariat,the Acting Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, Ms <span data-scayt_word="Andie" data-scaytid="7" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Andie</span> Fong Toy said, &ldquo;We welcome the decision of the Forum Leaders to lift Fiji&rsquo;s suspension from the Forum. I wish also to congratulate the Government and people of Fiji for the successful conduct and results of its national election. We look forward to Fiji resuming its participation in Forum activities.&rdquo;</p>

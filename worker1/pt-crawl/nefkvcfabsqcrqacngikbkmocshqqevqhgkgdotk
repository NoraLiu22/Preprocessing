<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">You asked if there has been any additional analysis of the feasibility of rail passenger service between New Haven and Hartford since the 1994 feasibility analysis done by the Department of Transportation (DOT).  You also wanted to know if there are tracks between Hartford and Waterbury that would make it possible for there to be rail passenger service between the two cities.  You wanted too know if this has been studied before, when it was studied, and, if this was some time ago, if any more recent analysis has been done.   </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style">SUMMARY</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The DOT performed a feasibility analysis of a New Haven-Hartford rail service proposal in 1994.  Due to considerable renewed interest in this idea, DOT recently completed a reassessment of the implementation and operating costs. But the two analyses are not directly comparable because the more recent estimates are for a more extensive service proposal that would extend to Springfield, Massachusetts and operate significantly more trains than the 1994 proposal.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">In the 1994 analysis, DOT estimated that a service involving three morning and three afternoon trips between New Haven and Hartford would require approximately $4.4 million in capital costs, have annual operating costs of $3.5 million and fare revenue of $1 million, and require an annual subsidy of $2.5 million. Preliminary ridership estimates were about 1,000 passengers per day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">DOT's more recent analysis involves an assumption of bi-directional service throughout the day with 30-minute headways between trains during the peak commuter periods and one-hour headways during the off-peak periods.  The service DOT considered would run from New Haven to Springfield, Massachusetts, through Hartford.  DOT estimated the capital costs for this level of service at approximately $249 million.  Annual operating costs were estimated at $17 million and annual revenue at $4 million, leaving a $13 million annual subsidy requirement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">While there is an intact rail right-of-way for the entire corridor between Hartford and Waterbury, there is apparently not track in place the entire way.  DOT studied a Waterbury-Hartford rail service proposal in 1992, but has not updated the analysis since then.  In its April 1992 report to the legislature, it estimated that peak period commuter service on 30-minute headways would require a capital investment of $95.9 million.  Ridership estimates were 2,490 daily trips with annual operating costs of $9.757 million.  Annual revenues were estimated at $1.11 million, leaving an estimated annual deficit of $8.65 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Any future consideration of Waterbury-Hartford rail service is complicated by the fact that DOT's current proposal for an exclusive busway between New Britain and Hartford, which it hopes to have operating in 2004, will be using part of this right-of-way.  This could preclude the possibility of continuous rail service between Waterbury and Hartford, although not necessarily between Waterbury and New Britain.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style">CURRENT ESTIMATES FOR NEW HAVEN-HARTFORD-SPRINGFIELD RAIL SERVICE</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The updated analysis of possible rail service in the New Haven-Springfield corridor was provided by Harry Harris, Chief of the DOT's Bureau of Public Transportation.  In responding to our inquiry, he stated that since there has been discussion about the possibility of rail service to the Bradley International Airport area, DOT thought it best to expand the scope of their analysis to include service as far north as Springfield.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The two most significant differences between the service proposal most recently analyzed by DOT and the one it conducted in 1994 are: (1) the service DOT analyzed would extend from New Haven to Springfield, Massachusetts instead of the 1994 proposal of service only between New Haven and Hartford and (2) the service in the most recent analysis would involve trains running in both directions every 30 minutes during peak commuter hours and every hour during non-peak hours, instead of the six-train scenario (three morning and three evening trains during the peak hours) analyzed in 1994.  These two differences make the current estimates significantly higher than the 1994 study and thus not directly comparable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">DOT estimates that the capital costs associated with such a service model would be $249 million.  About half of this ($121 million) is based on the assumption that it will not be possible to operate high frequency bi-directional service on the current single-track configuration using passing sidings.  (Amtrak removed sections of the second track along this corridor several years ago in a move to reduce its overhead costs.)  DOT believes the line will have to be restored to a full two-track system to run the level of service it feels will be necessary to establish a viable and effective service.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">DOT estimates the remaining portion of the $249 million in capital costs would involve $66 million to acquire rolling stock consisting of six locomotives and 30 coaches and $60 million for station upgrades, parking, and other related facilities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">DOT estimated that the service would attract 1,800 to 2,000 riders per day (3,600 to 4,000 passenger trips).  It estimates that the annual cost for operating the service would be $17 million and fare revenue would be about $4 million. This would result in an annual operating deficit of $13 million.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style">WATERBURY-HARTFORD RAIL SERVICE PROPOSAL</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Waterbury-Hartford rail service proposal was analyzed by DOT in 1992 and has not been updated.  There is an existing, intact right-of-way for the 31-mile corridor, but it is in varying conditions and ownership.  The section from Waterbury to New Britain essentially has intact track, but its service classification does not allow for passenger service and it would have to be upgraded to passenger service standards.  The section of the right-of-way from the west side of New Britain to Newington is intact but has no rails.  The section from Newington north to Hartford is part of Amtrak's inland route and has a single track with passing sidings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">DOT's current plan for the New Britain-Hartford Busway Project calls for it to occupy part of the right of way.  Since the busway would impinge on the right-of-way available for rail service, it probably would make it difficult to create rail service between New Britain and Hartford that would need this same right-of-way.</font></p>

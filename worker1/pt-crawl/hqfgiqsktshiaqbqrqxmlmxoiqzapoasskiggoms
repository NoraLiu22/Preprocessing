<h2>
Controversial subjects</h2>
<p>Any opinion expressed by a contributor about a controversial subject
is to be considered his/her own personal opinion, not the opinion of the
website managers, director or editors. The fact that our images are used
in another website or any other media should not be considered as an endorsement
of ours for any opinion expressed nor of the images posted here.
<br>
<hr><a NAME="acc"></a>
<h2>
Accuracy</h2>
The quality of images and news varies very much: the website contains not
only well-known flags but also sketches and rumours, often seized on the
spot from a TV report or a magazine. In any case we disclaim any responsibility
about the veracity and accuracy of the contents of the website.
<br>
<hr><a NAME="hos"></a>
<h2>
The hosting organization</h2>
The organization that is hosting the website is not responsible in any
way for the contents of the website.
<br>
<hr><a NAME="cop"></a>
<h2>Copyright</h2>
Most text and images contained in the website are made by the contributors
themselves. If the contributor states the source of the information, we
report it, otherwise we assume it is new material and the copyright is
owned by the contributor.  Our editorial policy is to include images only when we can ascertain that we have permission to use them.  However, it is often the case that an image is provided to us with little back-up information associated with it.  In such cases we try to assess if the image is owned by someone before posting it.  If you encounter an image which you think may be from your site and used on FOTW without permission, please contact the editor of the page to advise him.  Our intent is to provide as complete a collection of the world's flags as possible, and we would be most grateful to be able to use your image.  If we know where it comes from, we will credit it.
<br>Some pictures are derived from cliparts of graphical programs. Cliparts
normally can be incorporated into drawings without any copyright problems.
Therefore we add them to the website without declaring anything about their
origin.
<br>You can freely use any material copyrighted by the contributors of
the website, provided that:
<ul>
<li>you limit your use to a maximum of 5% of the images or content of the
  website

<li>you quote the author

<li>you quote the website (as "FOTW Flags Of The World website at 
https://www.fotw.info/&quot;)

<li>you do not alter in any way the images or the content of the text

<li>you use the material for non-commercial and non-political purposes only

<li>if you distribute our material by a non-Internet way (e.g., floppy disks or
CD-ROM) you must add this copyright text on every copy of the medium

<li>if you distribute our materials by a non-Internet way (e.g., floppy disks
or CD-ROM) you cannot sell these media

<li>If you want to reuse FOTW GeoIndex maps and boundaries' data, read these
<a href="g-copy.html">rules</a>

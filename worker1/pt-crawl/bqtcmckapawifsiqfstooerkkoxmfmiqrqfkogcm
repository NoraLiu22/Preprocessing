    Research Interests - Mass loss and Evolution

  </big>
  </b>

<p>Hot-star winds are driven by radiation pressure via millions
of metal lines. For this reason, the metallicity of the parent galaxy plays a crucial
role in massive-star evolution, since it defines their internal
structure, opacities and stellar wind properties. The precise relation
between metallicity and mass loss, a key ingredient for the reliable
population synthesis of young galaxies, is, however, poorly known. We
are therefore employing a variety of observations to constrain this
relationship. We have used the 2dF facility at the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122143115/http://www.aao.gov.au/">Anglo-Australian Telescope</a>
to obtain optical spectra of a truly representative sample of Small Magellanic
Cloud stars, which has abundances of metals smaller than our own
Galaxy by an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>The abundances of helium,
carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are sensitive indicators of
processed material. We are studying these elements,
using elaborate non-LTE model atmospheres, and high-quality spectra,
including far-UV, UV, optical and IR diagnostics. The most direct method of deriving
empirical mass-loss rates for hot stars is through the analysis of UV
resonance transitions from dominant metal ions. However, difficulties
in deriving the wind ionisation balance using currently available
(trace) ions means that mass-loss rates remain uncertain.</p>

</center>

<p>Archival Hubble Space Telescope FOS and GHRS data sets have been
used to collect ultraviolet evidence for large- and small-scale
stellar wind structure in extragalactic Local Group OB stars
(i.e. SMC, LMC including R136, M31, M33, and NGC6822).  By comparison
to previous studies of Galactic OB stars, wind activity is principally
diagnosed in individual spectrograms via the presence of `narrow
absorption components' and saturated `black' absorption troughs in the
resonance line doublets. Their observed characteristics broadly
suggest that these stars share the same physical mechanisms for
perturbing the winds as those that act in Galactic OB stars.  Both
these spectral indicators are also used to provide reliable measures
of wind terminal velocities. These velocities are directly compared to
previously published Galactic OB star values, without reliance on
model profile fitting.  Relative to Galactic OB stars, the most
discrepant terminal velocities (and wind line profiles) are due to
MAIN-SEQUENCE early O-type stars in the SMC (<b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122143115/http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1998MNRAS.300..828P&amp;db_key=AST&amp;link_type=ABSTRACT&amp;high=3f940ed2cc15312">Prinja
&amp; Crowther, 1998 MNRAS 300 828</a></b> see above).</p>

<p>We are also attacking the mass-loss problem with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122143115/http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~pac/fuse/fuse.html"> FUSE</a>
telescope. Relative to IUE/HST, additional wind lines will be
observed, spanning a much wider range of species. From these data, the
degree of ionization can be determined accurately, so that mass-loss
rates can be measured with confidence. In addition, FUSE will observe
massive stars in both the Galaxy <i>and</i> the Magellanic Clouds -
spanning a factor of ten in metallicity - so that the variation of
mass-loss properties with metal content will be measured,
<i> of importance in the study of high redshift galaxies</i>.</p>

<p>Our studies have been greatly enhanced by the launch of the ESA (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122143115/http://isowww.estec.esa.nl/">Infrared Space Observatory
(ISO)</a>.  We have used the Short Wavelength Spectrometer to obtain
mid-IR (2.6-30 micron) spectroscopy of several WC stars.
<b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122143115/http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2000MNRAS.315..407D&amp;db_key=AST&amp;link_type=ABSTRACT&amp;high=3f940ed2cc15377">Dessart

et al. (MNRAS 290 371)</a></b> analyse UV/optical and ISO-SWS
spectroscopy of several WC stars, including WR11, WR90, WR135 and
WR146.  In all cases, abundances derived from neon lines confirmed a
substantial enrichment, by factors of 6 to 8, but these are lower than
predictions from evolutionary models imply.</p>

<p>We have also used spectroscopic models to observationally determine
the evolutionary paths between O and the late WN (WNL) stars in the
LMC, involving so-called Ofpe/WN9 stars. Theoretical models predict
that the most massive stars pass through an intermediate, unstable
stage corresponding to either a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV), or a red
supergiant (RSG) phase for lower mass stars. Our studies have shown
that Ofpe/WN9 stars are probably dormant LBVs <b> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122143115/http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1997A%26A...320..500C&amp;db_key=AST&amp;link_type=ABSTRACT&amp;high=3f940ed2cc15615">Crowther &amp; Smith

<p>We are studying variability in
the outflows from massive O, B and Wolf-Rayet stars using UV,
optical, IR and radio observations. The
denser winds of WR stars are well known to be variable on timescales
of hours, based on previous ultraviolet and optical investigations.</p>

<p>Our ideas about WR and O star winds have changed dramatically over
the last ten years; the picture that is now emerging is one in which
the winds are time-dependent and permeated by shocks driven by
radiative instabilities. We have continued extensive studies of
stellar wind variability in WR stars, with particular attention to
extensive IUE monitoring (over continuous periods of 6-7 days). We
have been involved with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122143115/http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1995ApJ%2E%2E%2E452L%2E%2E53M&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1">

B supergiant</a> have been continuously monitored with the IUE
satellite over 15 days.  This will allow us to investigate the
time-dependent UV profile variability over several consecutive stellar
rotation periods, to probe the connection between rotation and the
occurrence of wind structure/variability linked to radiatively-induced
wind instabilities. An intensive optical variability study of an Of
star, HD151804, has also recently been performed (<b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122143115/http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1996A%26A...311..264P&amp;db_key=AST&amp;link_type=ABSTRACT&amp;high=3f941504e516911">Prinja,
Fullerton and Crowther 1996 A&amp;A 311 264</a></b>).</p>

<p>From our previous UV studies of WR6 the P Cygni absorption profiles
are seen to vary in the sense that extra absorption, at velocities
exceeding the wind terminal velocity, increases and decays with a
recurrence timescale of 1 day.  The much smaller variations detected
in the P Cygni emission components suggest that the material giving
rise to the variability has a characteristic linear scale of the order
of the core radius. The nature of these variations is most easily
explained by radiative instabilities driving high speed, rarefied
shocked gas through the stellar wind of WR6 (<b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122143115/http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1996A%26A...310..577W&amp;db_key=AST&amp;link_type=ABSTRACT&amp;high=3f941504e516936">Willis
&amp; Stevens 1996 A&A; 310 577</a></b>).  In a parallel study we have
secured Guest Observer PSPC ROSAT observations of WR6 at two epochs.
Our results show no phase--dependent modulation in the X-ray flux, no
evidence for variations on timescales of less than 1 hour (previously
suggested from EINSTEIN data), and evidence for significant variations
(at the 30% level) on a daily timescale. These results suggest a
pattern of X-ray variability consistent with our IUE-based conclusions
above.</p>

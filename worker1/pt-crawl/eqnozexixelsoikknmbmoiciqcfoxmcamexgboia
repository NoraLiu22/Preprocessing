<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 4.0.47--><p><strong>An alphabetical list of over 370 Creatures &amp; Mythical Beings from Philippine Folklore &amp; Mythology</strong></p>
<p>I have dozens resources that I use when I am researching the mythical beings and folkloric beliefs of the Philippines. I used to lament about what a pain in the butt it is to pull them all out every time I get curious about a mythical being. A few years ago I thought, wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if a place existed where I could access the names of the documented creatures and the regions from which they come? I started this list and it quickly grew to well over 250 beings. Sadly, I didn&#8217;t have the time to keep up with it. Over time, and with reader&#8217;s help, I realized there were some discrepancies, possibly incorrect regions, and many missing entries. So, five years after initially launching this list I have finally spent the last week updating descriptions, adding entries, and most importantly, including sources &#8211; something I always encourage others to do.</p>
<p>This list includes &#8216;creatures,&#8217; &#8216;monsters,&#8217; spirits, folkloric beings, &#8216;witches,&#8217; and mythical beasts, who are generally thought to cause harm or illness to people if they are not properly respected or given offering. You will also find some mythical beasts from epics and folktales. I have included the &#8220;witches&#8221; who are thought to cause harm to people &#8211; because I have seen how this list has been used over the past several years. I have tried to exclude beings that are regarded more as deities within their ethnolinguistic groups. This list should not be considered as precolonial beliefs. While some were most certainly part of early religions around the archipelago, these beings have evolved to reflect the influences and environment up to the time of documentation.</p>
<p>You may click on highlighted names to learn more about the religious beliefs structures that the described being is part of. Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>ABAT</strong> &#8211; <em>(Waray, Eastern Samar) </em>A Waray aswang that sucks internal organs. Big red bulging eyes, fingers long and bony, and dishevelled hair. Detaches from lower body. The creature is said to resemble a beautiful maiden by day and marries an unsuspecting man in order to live close to human communities. She goes to bed early with her spouse, and one informant from Samar reported that the creature quietly gets out of bed at moonrise, opens an eastern window, and stares at the newly-risen moon until her lower body drops off. The<em> abats</em> of a town can visit neighboring towns. They fly over nipa houses in which live pregnant women.<br />

<p><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/legend-of-the-agta-the-eastern-visayan-tree-dweller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>AGTA</strong> </a>&#8211; <em>(Eastern Visayas)</em> On September 18, 1963, Virginia Taglucop told folklorist Maximo Ramos that she and her sister were walking on a lonely footpath in Barrio Palanas, Masbate, in 1957 when they saw an <em>agta</em> sitting under a big santol tree (Sandoricum koetjape). The creature stood and walked toward them for a distance of twenty-five meters before they ran away. The creature was black and twice as tall as an ordinary man. The <em>agta</em> of the East Visayas are said to live in mangroves and swampy places. The<em> agta</em> was reported to have carried a rattan cane &#8211; the only Philippine creature shown by the data to be provided with this elegant appurtenance. The<em> Agta</em> reported most often in Leyte smoked a large cigar and it can usually be seen in a standing position. Benilda Moreno (from Barrio Gabas, Baybay, Leyte) said that an <em>agta</em> once ordered some night fishermen not to proceed, blocking their river route with large trees which it had knocked down to give force to its demand. Virginia Taglucop reported seeing an<em> agta</em> smoke, between eight in the evening and four the next morning, under a santol tree in which it resided. Although they share similar traits, the <em>Agta</em> should not be considered a ‘variety’ of <em>kapre,</em> but instead one of the many tall, black, tree dwellers that have been (mis)classified under that umbrella term.</p>
<p>The <em>Agta</em> has also been described as a supernatural man of dark complexion and extraordinary size inhabiting trees, cliffs, or empty houses. He is said to play practical jokes on people or kidnap them. He has a large cigar in his mouth. In Bacolod, people believe the <em>Agta</em> is human, giant and very black. He stays in a tall tree, wears a hat, and smokes a pipe. He is harmless as long as people do not harm him.</p>
<p>As a protection against the <em>agta</em>, a bottle filled with mercury (asugui) should always be carried, because they are afraid of mercury.<br />

The<em> alan&#8217;s</em> long arms had fingers pointing back from the wrist, horrible to look at. Elsewhere, the<em> alan</em> are said to be as large as people but have wings and can fly. Their toes are at the back of their feet, and their fingers point backward from their<br />
wrists with long nails. The<em> alan</em> is said to have lived in the depths of a dark forest where people seldom went. They hang upside down from a tree like a bat. In a tale &#8220;The Alan and the Hunters,&#8221; a man climbed to the top of a forest tree and saw smoke rising in the distance. He and his companion then walked toward the smoke and reached the house of a female <em>alan</em>. They killed her and found a jar of beads; and another jar of gold in her house.</p>
<p>The Lepanto tale (Benguet Province) &#8220;How a Young Man Escapes a Cannibal&#8221; tells that the <em>alan</em> lived in a house of pure gold in Kitlungan. They alan are rumoured to adopt children who have been lost in the jungle. This cannibalistic version of the<em> alan</em> in Northern Luzon should be quite a character to draw—rough skinned, long-armed, winged, but cravely afraid of crabs, his hands and feet set wrong end forward, when asleep hanging upside down from a branch like an enormous bat or bird, and yet courting and being accepted by village girls and able to trade off his green mangoes for human male babies.</p>
<p>They are said to procreate by collecting menstrual blood, aborted fetuses, and afterbirth from humans, which they form into Alan children.</p>
<p>There is a regional variant of the <em>alan</em> in northwestern Pangasinan and La Union. They describe these creatures as taller than most people, their complexion is a bit darker than the rest of the local community, but they have eyes that are light/fair (amber or light brown). They seem to live in tribal communities and travel during full moon or sometimes at dusk, beating drums and bells.<br />

<p><strong>ALLAWIG </strong>&#8211; <em>(Ilokano)</em> The <em>allawig</em>, also known as silew-silew (&#8216;lighter&#8217;), is a ball of fire moving across open fields or through wooded areas at night. Unlike fire, it ignites nothing it<br />
touches. It is commonly red but may be blue, green, orange, or yellow. Unlike a real flame, too, it is round rather than peaked. It may burn bright or just flicker. One under its spell follows it and is then led round and round until he falls down in exhaustion. The creature may also lead a man into a mudhole or swamp where he can drown. One under the spell of the <em>allawig</em> should take off his clothes and put them on inside out. The creature will then leave and he will find his way home, which may prove to be just around the corner after all.<br />

She lives in the woods, quietly enters villages at night, and sucks the blood of those asleep.</p>
<p>When about to die, a vampire asks a close relative to take over her vampirism. If no one agrees to do so, she lives on and remains a vampire.</p>
<p>One should climb up a crooked tree when pursued by the Hiligaynon vampire—the <em>amalanhig</em>—since her joints are stiff and she cannot negotiate the crook in the tree. If no crooked tree is around, one being pursued by her should follow a crooked path, for the vampire cannot follow such a path because she cannot bend her legs to turn. Or one should jump into a river or lake since an <em>amalanhig</em> fears bodies of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;An old man from a distant barrio in one of our towns is known throughout as a<em> maranhig</em>. This man is old and cannot die unless someone in his family inherits his power. Whenever he begs, his children to take his power, saliva comes out of his mouth and reaches down to the ground. The saliva is long like a rope and sticky. His sons married women from outside the province who did not know about their sickness. His daughters have become spinsters and cannot marry unless one of them inherits her father&#8217;s power.</p>
<p>Only one in the family will become a <em>maranhig</em> and will do as he does. The old man used to make those who talked about them sick.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong>ANI-ANI</strong> &#8211; <em>(Zambales)</em> The <em>ani-ani</em> is said to stand eighteen feet tall. A man may think he is standing between two trees and then realize that he is between the lower legs of the <em>ani-ani</em>. The creature lumbers along because of its great size. It is dark-complexioned, hairy, and bearded. Its nose is flat and its mouth wide, and it has a rough skin. It generally appears when there is a new moon and may be seen at night smoking on the branch of a large tree beside a country road such as the <em>bulala</em> (Iloko) or<em> talisay</em> (Tagalogs). The ani-ani blocks the path of a wayfarer at night. It changes its shape from that of a tall, dark man to that of a carabao without horns, a horse, or a hog and back into a tall, dark man again.<br />

<p><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/bagobo-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ASUÁNG</strong></a> &#8211; <em>(Bagobo, Mayo Disctrict)</em> This name is applied to a class of malevolent spirits who inhabit certain trees, cliffs and streams. They delight to trouble or injure the living, and sickness is usually caused by them. For this reason, when a person falls ill, a ballyan offers a live chicken to these spirits bidding them &#8220;to take and kill this chicken in place of this man, so that he need not die.&#8221; If the patient recovers it is understood that the asuang have agreed to the exchange and the bird is released in the jungle.</p>
<p>There are many spirits who are known as asuang but the five most powerful are here given according to their rank, (a) Tagbanua, (b) Tagamaling, (c) Sigbinan, (d) Lumaman, (e) Bigwa. The first two are of equal importance and are only a little less powerful than Diwata. They sometimes inhabit caves but generally reside in the bud-bud (baliti) trees. The ground beneath these trees is generally free from undergrowth and thus it is known that &#8220;a spirit who keeps his yard clean resides there.&#8221; In clearing ground for a new field it sometimes becomes necessary to cut down one of these trees, but before it is disturbed an offering of betel-nut, food, and a white chicken is carried to the plot. The throat of the fowl is cut and its blood is allowed to fall in the roots of the tree. Meanwhile one of the older men calls the attention of the spirits to the offerings and begs that they be accepted in payment for the dwelling which they are about to destroy. This food is never eaten, as is customary with offerings made to other spirits. After a lapse of two or three days it is thought that the occupant of the tree has had time to move and the plot is cleared.<br />

<p><strong><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/aswang-phenomenon-documentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASWANG</a> </strong>&#8211; The aswang concept is most usefully understood as a congeries of beliefs about five types of mythical beings identifiable with certain creatures of the European tradition: (1) the blood-sucking vampire, (2) the self-segmenting viscera sucker, (3) the man-eating weredog, (4) the vindictive or evil-eye witch, and (5) the carrion-eating ghoul. Thus when Philippine folk speak of the aswang, they generally refer to the physical traits, habitat, or activities of these five types of mythical beings, and sometimes also of other mythical entities like the demon, dwarf, and elf. What follows is a brief description of each aspect of the aswang, a term chiefly used by the Tagalogs, Bikol, and Visayan groups in the country.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Blood sucker Aspect:</strong> Bicol, Cebu, Visayas, Ilokano) </em>By Philippine folk traditions, the vampire is a bloodsucking creature disguised as a beautiful maiden. It marries an unsuspecting youth and thus can sip a little of his blood each night till he dies of anemia, whereupon the monster gets itself another husband. To suck blood the vampire uses the tip of its tongue, pointed like the proboscis of a mosquito, to pierce the jugular vein.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Viscera Sucker Aspect:</strong> Bicol, Luzon) </em>The viscera sucker is a mythical being said to suck out the internal organs (naguneg in Iloko, laman luob in Tagalog, kasudlan in West Visayan) or to feed on the voided phlegm of the sick. This creature rarely occurs in European folklore but is widespread in Malaysia. It is reported to look like an attractive woman by day, buxom, long-haired, and light complexioned. Its tongue is extended, narrow, and tubular like a drinking straw — but not pointed like the vampire&#8217;s— and it is capable of being distended to a great length. At night the monster discards its lower body from the waist down and flies or floats or glides out.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Were-Beast Aspects:</strong> Bicol, Cebu, Western Visayas, Luzon) </em>The weredog is a mythical being said to be a man or woman— chiefly the former—by day, but at night to turn into a ferocious beast, principally a dog, known as aso in many Philippine languages. A werewolf is identified with the fiercest animal in a region, so that Europe has werewolves, China werefoxes, and India weretigers. Since there are no wolves in the Philippines, the term weredog is more appropriate; although the term werebeast may, in some cases, be even more applicable.<br />
A weredog is said to reside in a village and turn into a ferocious dog, boar, or large cat at about midnight.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Witch Aspects:</strong> Bicol, Cebu, Eastern Visayas) </em>Another member of the cluster of mythical concepts encompassed by the term aswang is the witch, believed by the folk to be a man or woman—mostly the latter— who is extremely vindictive or who causes sickness without meaning to do so. By magically intruding various objects—shells, bone, unhusked rice, fish, and insects of various species—through the victim&#8217;s bodily orifices or by herself entering the victim&#8217;s body, the Philippine witch punishes those by whom she has been put out. Or by an innocent look or remark, she also makes an equally innocent victim ill. Unlike the European witches, however, the Philippine witch has no appetite for human flesh. She is shy and lives in abandoned houses at the outskirts of towns and villages. She will not look people straight in the eye because the image in the pupils of her eyes is said to be upside down and the pupils are thin and elongated like a cat&#8217;s or lizard&#8217;s in bright sunshine.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Ghoul Aspect:</strong> Many areas in the Philippines) T</em>he Philippine ghoul is said to steal human corpses and devour them. For this purpose, its nails are horned, curved, and sharp and its teeth pointed. Its smell and breath are fetid, and though generally invisible, the creature is said to look like a human being when it shows itself. Some ghouls live in human communities. At night they congregate in large trees near a cemetery and then descend atid exhume the newly buried corpses. They devour their plunder, making audible noises as they do so. A ghoul is said to be able to hear, over great distances, the groans of the dying. Its greed is aroused when it catches the scent of death, and then it snatches the mourners as well as the dead.<br />

<p><strong>ASUWANG NA LAKAW</strong> &#8211; <em>(Bicol)</em> A classification of asuwang detailed by Francis Lynch, S.J. in his paper &#8220;An Mga Asuwang: A Bicol Belief&#8221;. This kind of asuwang, the walking species, is by far the most common. <em>Asuwang na lakaw</em> decides, about 6 p.m., where he or she operates that night by putting his ear to the rice mortar and listening to sounds of mourners, or listens for such sounds while standing on his head, resting in a shallow hole in the ground, or, say others, removing the cover of a specially made listening well and listening. At 8 o’clock he leaves for his operations. Some claim this asuwang uses a special concoction rubbed over its body (a premixed ointment consisting of chicken dung and coconut oil).<br />

<p><strong>ASUWANG NA LAYOG</strong> &#8211; <em>(Bicol) </em>A classification of asuwang detailed by Francis Lynch, S.J. in his paper &#8220;An Mga Asuwang: A Bicol Belief&#8221;. There are two kinds of flying<em> asuwang</em>: the simple <em>asuwang na layog</em>, and the <em>anananggal</em>. They differ in that the latter type leaves its trunk and limbs in some secluded spot while the head and entrails take to the air. The former flies with its entire body intact.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lynch, from his compilation of Bikol <em>asuwang </em>studies, revealed that the <em>anananggal</em> goes into the hidden portion of the house or a secluded area, then, “…..dipping his right hand into the foul smelling ointment which he has prepared, applies it on the line beginning from the tip of of the little finger of the left hand, progressing the length of the arm to the armpit, thence down his left side and the outer side of his left leg, ending at the tip of the little toe. Then the left hand is dipped into the chicken dung mixture and the process is duplicated on the right side of the body. During the operations, he repeats to himself, but alone, the following formula or its equivalent: <em>Siri siri daing Diyos kung banggi, labaw sa kahoyan, lagbas sa kasirongan! </em>Literally translated, the formula reads, “<em>siri, siri, </em>there is no God at night, over trees, under houses.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Supposedly after the application of the chicken dung mixture, an oily membrane appears on both sides of the body, more like flying skin folds. For the ordinary <em>layog, </em>he needs only to jump and hop for momentum before he ascends to the night sky. The <em>anananggal </em>reacts differently. Propping himself against a wall, if there be one, through magic he is then presumed to detach himself from his lower limbs. The cry <em>kakak </em>or <em>kikik</em> is heard in the process of flight.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <em>anananggal </em>creature perches on the roof where he droolingly awaits his next meal, and it is his long thread-like tongue that passes through the roof shingles.<br />

<p><strong>AWAN-ULO-NA</strong> &#8211; <em>(Iloko) </em>This creature is a headless being often vaguely referred to in the Iloko region as the awan-ulo-na, ‘headless one’.

<p><strong>BACOBACO &#8211; </strong><em>(Zambales) </em>In 1915, Henry Otley Beyer recorded a myth of the Ayta living in Zambales that sounds very much like a volcanic eruption of Pinatubo. The battle is between Algao, which may be northern name for the Sun (related to Aldo), and Bacobaco, a great sea turtle. In this account Algao and Bacobaco have a great battle in which the latter eventually bores into the top of Pinatubo creating a great crater and emitting great flames, huge rocks, mud, ashes, smoke and deafening noise in the process. According to the legend, Bacobaco continued to dwell in the mountain and when he comes out <em>&#8220;woe be to us.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>BAGAT</strong> &#8211; <em>(Central Panay) </em>The bagat, according to the Central Panay people, are seen on a full moon, or when it is extremely dark after a slight drizzle earlier in the evening. They assume the form of domestic animals and are normally harmless. However, they are dangerous when harmed. Some of them are pets of supernatural beings. The aswang also sometimes take the form of the bagat.<br />

He has two sets of wings, whiskers, a red tongue, and a mouth ‘the size of a lake.’ The Filipinos once thought that the Bakunawa lived in the sea at a time when the world had seven moons that the serpents, being fascinated by their light, would rise out of the sea into the sky and consume the moons. Thus, the serpents were the cause of lunar eclipses. To prevent the world from becoming dark the people would run out of their homes, taking their pots and pans, to make the most noise they could in order to scare the Bakunawa so they would stop eating the moons, and give them the moonlight back. But in some versions, these serpents also devour the sun in which case also cause the solar eclipse. <strong><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/bakunawa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Learn more about Bakunawa)</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>BAKUNAWA</strong> &#8211; <em>(Bicol)</em> The ancient Bikols were also nature worshippers. They stood in awe and prostrated themselves in worship before the ineffable god of nature. The halia was a feast dedicated to the full moon to prevent the bakunawa, a horrible sky serpent from devouring the moon and leaving them in perpetual darkness. The feast was performed with the wild beating of the gimbals and balalongs.<br />

<p><strong>BALBAL </strong>&#8211; <em>(Maranao) </em>Another specie of witch is the so-called balbal, which is said to evolve when the bird laasan (possibly a kingfisher) enters a person’s body and with its gradual growth within, enhances the bewitched person’s metamorphosis. Traditionally making a nocturnal appearance, especially during a full moon, the balbal is noted for devouring corpses as well as foetuses, making it the scourge of women in the family way. Its compulsive habit of yawning whenever faced with corpses during wakes seems to be a common means of detecting a balbal.<br />

<p><strong>BANIG</strong><em> &#8211; (Ifugao) </em>Whenever there is a death the soul of the deceased roams about for a while as a temporary or transient ghost. Ghosts of those dead from natural causes are not much feared, but those dead from violence or childbirth are. Besides transient (disembodied) ghosts the Ifugao sees in almost everything and every place permanent ( unembodied) ones. These permanent ghosts (not individually named), aside from scaring people well nigh to death, cause sickness. If the <em>agba</em>, the divination stick, points to ghosts as the source of an affliction, it is necessary to sacrifice a chicken in the fields at midnight. In such a rite the priest knows, when he feels his body swell up, that the ghosts have come to partake of the offering.<br />

<p><strong>BANNOG </strong>&#8211; <em>(Ilokano, Tingguian) </em>Most Philippine giants appear to have human shape, although one, the bannog of Northern Luzon, was in the form of a huge bird. The bannog which features in the Tingguian tale “Sogsogot” was large enough to swoop down on a hunter, clutch him in its talons, and carry him to its nest on top of a large tree. The bannog in an Isneg tale, “The Negrito and the Birds,” flew off with both the hunter and the hunter’s catch, a wild boar. The young of the bannog were so large that a hunter rode out of the nest on one of them as it fluttered down in its first flight.<br />

Having to do with demonology and angelology is the belief common to all nationalities that supernatural beings, as delineated in folklore, are either beneficent or malevolent towards man. Even the denizens of fairyland, who are understood to be mostly helpful, are thus classified. So are the banwaanon of the Cebu-Visayan Filipinos.<br />

Their astral bodies are then liberated&#8230;. They fly away, and entering a house make their way into the body of one of the occupants and feed on their entrails&#8230;.. The arrival of the Berbalangs may be heard from afar, as they make a moaning noise which is loud from a distance but dies away into a feeble moan as they approach. When they are near you the sound of their wings may be heard and the flashing lights of their eyes can be seen like dancing fire-flies in the dark. Should you be the happy possessor of a cocoa-nut pearl you are safe, but otherwise the only way to beat them off is to jab at them with a kris, the blade of which has been rubbed with the juice of a lime. If you see the lights and hear the moaning in front of you, wheel fast and make a cut in the opposite direction. Berbalangs always go by contraries and are never where they appear to be.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong>BERBEROKA </strong> &#8211; <em>(Apayao)</em> The size of Berberoka, the Apayao ogre, is indicated by the fact that the river dried up when he reclined across it, and when he suddenly got up, the people who had gone to pick up the stranded fish drowned. Berberoka “could change himself at will,” and reclined across a stream and suddenly got up each time a crab pinched him. He grew correspondingly larger in size as the water which he dammed up with his body rose, but he was killed when he swallowed a woman who had a hatchet concealed in her hair.<br />

<p><strong>BINGIL</strong> &#8211; <em>(Kalinga, Gaddang)</em> If a <em>sangasang</em> (shrine)was not erected at a new site settled by these shifting cultivators, it was said that a bingi would appear- a person covered with old wounds and pus, and smelling like rotten flesh, with his tongue hanging out, like a severed head. Illness or death would plague the settlement until a shrine was erected. The bingil could only be propitiated by a headhunt or a large animal sacrifice and a chase (dagdag) in which all the village residents took part.</p>
<p>For this rite, an effigy of the bingil is tied to a pole where the shrine will be erected, with a banana trunk as its body, rags hung on it for clothes, and an old raincoat. A broken pot on top represents the head. Bamboo tubes ate struck with other objects to make noise and to drive the bingil out of the village. The participants chase it out toward the effigy, then strike the banana trunk with spears of the same kind used in headhunts and run away to the village. A medium who joins them in the chase becomes possessed by the bingil and pursues them back to their houses. Her tongue hangs out like the bingil, and her touch is said to kill any person she catches. When the participants have arrived back at the house once haunted by the bingil, the bingil-medium says he will no longer molest them and leaves, to stay at the village shrine with the other guardians.<br />

He has big feet and fingers, but small arms, and his two big teeth are long and pointed.

<p><strong>BUYAGAN</strong> &#8211; <em>(Cebu) </em>A buyagan is a person known to cause certain ailments by merely commenting on anyone. It is a popular belief that one who is born coincidentally with the rising of the sun (pagsilaw sa adlaw) will grow up to be a dangerous buyagan. A first class buyagan possesses a very dark tongue.”</p>
<p>&#8220;A real buyagan uses only his saliva to cure an ailment that may result from the comments made. . . .&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In cases where the real buyagan could not be found, anyone who has been treated by him is considered qualified to administer the treatment. In this case bun- ga* (a fruit), mayana* leaves an ash from the hearth are chewed together and this concoction is spat on the head, on the temples, at the nape, at the spinal column, and on the joints of the limbs. Other effects of buyag are itches or scabies and pain in that part of the body commented upon.”<br />

They mix with people and attend public dances. They go to college and travel in foreign lands. They drive new cars and win beauty contests. But they live deep in the wild woods. What we think are balete trees are their mansions. We hear the clink of dishes in their kitchens. We smell their cooking and hear their babies cry. An attractive city girl once came to the village. She wanted to spend a quiet summer near a forest. A good-looking youth met her at the village dance. They danced and danced, and she fell in love. She agreed to visit his folks. In his car he drove her to a beautiful city. The streets were wide and the houses were splendid. Next morning she was found weeping in the woods alone.<br />

However it is assumed that they do not give this name just to a singular spirit. 6. Also the Manobos (Mindanao) have spirit called Diwata. 7. The Subanos (Mindanao) relate, according to P. Sanchez, only in a vague meaning of the Diwata, and dark idea of god, of whom they are very afraid of. It is assumed that the Subanos know not only one, but many diwatas. 8. The Tirurayes call a superstitious fish that has eight heads and lives in Ombligo or in the middle of the sea, a Diwata. It is assumed that this is not the only monster that the Tirurayes call Diwata. Other spirits and mythical beings are also called this name. 9.

<p><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/bikolano-deities-in-philippine-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DWENDE</strong></a><em> &#8211; (Various Regions)</em> A dwende is a short, long-bearded old man who dwells in a ponso, or a mound resembling an ant hill. Those who inhabit rivers are called water dwarves. Dwarves are classified as black or white. The white dwarves are happy and do not harm humans. They live in ceilings and attics and sometimes the owner of the house hears their laughter. The black dwarves are malevolent and could cause illness and death. When black dwarves inhabit a house, the members of the house meet all kinds of misfortune. The dwende is full of mischief—it steals money or food, or a thing that may take its fancy. Some dwendes live in a mound on the ground. If a man happens to urinate on its abode, it can cause bongao or inflammation of the man’s genitals. They are helpful and like to live with humans. Sometimes they are offended and cause illness or even death of the persons with whom they live. Clothes must be taken from the clothesline before dark lest they be stolen and worn by dwendes.<br />

<p>Jeannie Javelosa recalled, &#8220;Saw one really beautiful female creature at the &#8216;llalim&#8217;, crater of Mt. Banahaw when I went down there. She was floating, dressed in a pearlized luminescent silver-white gown with a long veil extended. Dark hair &#8211; not menacing, very beautiful. I was enthralled.

They inhabit our world, and can see us, but, more often than not, we are unable to see and mingle with them unless they allow us to do so. An engkanto is an enchanted creature that can assume an assortment of images. It may be a dog, a cat, a beggar or a beautiful woman. It does this when it wants to enchant human beings. Before bathing in the river, one needs the permission of the engkantos. An engkanto is usually invisible; if “seen by the human eye” it is said to be very white or very bright. If it gets angry or falls in love with a human, the latter falls ill or dies. Engkantos are like human beings in appearance and habits. However, they envy humans because the latter occupy and enjoy the visible world. When children are alone, engkantos take pity on them and bring them to its kingdom.<br />

Three brothers pursued a small bird that had been snatching off their father’s golden beard, and it descended by a pit in the sea. The youngest went down after it by using many lengths of rope joined end to end, and he reached the region under the sea. There the garuda had imprisoned three princesses in separate mansions of increasing size and magnificence.

One princess explained, <em>“Have you not heard about the winged monster Garuda? When he flies, his wings sound like ten thunderstorms. The sweep of his wings pulls down houses and uproots trees. He can carry six men in his talons, and I tremble to think what will happen if he finds you here.”</em></p>
<p>The garuda in Maranao story “The Tale of Diwata” lived in a cave on the summit of a mountain made inaccessible by a pathless jungle. The summit was bare, but the hero <em>“found bones scattered about.”</em> Entering the cave, he came to “a magnificent house.” He walked in and saw <em>. . . in the hall a beautiful table of solid gold.

He sat down on one of the chairs, and to his surprise two betel-nut boxes—one of gold and the other of silver—floated into the hall and placed themselves on the table. </em> —an occurrence which the hero understood to be a conventional sign of welcome. The garuda was subject to flattery and it revealed its life index to its captive because of her smooth words. As it lay dying from stab wounds inflicted by the hero, the garuda “looked up at [the hero] and congratulated him on his success.<br />

Without the use of medicine, and by simply saluting or raising the hand, they killed whom they chose. But if they desired to heal those whom they had made ill by their charms, they did so by using other charms. Moreover, if they wished to destroy the house of some Indian hostile to them, they were able to do so without instruments. This was in Catanduanes, an island off the upper part of Luzon.</p>
<p>Jocano notes; we think that Hukluban may have been considered the last agent of Sitan and could change herself into any form she desired. She could kill someone by simply raising her hand and could heal without any difficulty as she wished. Her name literally means “crone” or “hag.”</p>
<p>Today, the Hukloban is also considered a “witch” who could kill anyone simply by pointing a finger at him and without using any potion. It could destroy a house by merely saying so. The Hukloban appear as a very old, crooked woman.<br />

<p><strong>IQUI </strong> <em>&#8211; (Tagalogs)</em> The “iqui” is a man who has the virtue of flying at night, leaving half his body, from the waist to his feet, in his home. It is said that the “iqui” lives only on the liver of men, and when he sallies out at night, he stations himself on the roofs of houses, whence he kills sick persons by means of a tongue of such fineness that it can hardly be distinguished, appearing like a thread of cotton, which penetrates his bowels, causing death. What is not explained is the method they employ to remove the livers.<br />

The term kapre refers to a creature described by Zambales informants as &#8230;another black creature with the power of changing its size from that of a manikin to that of a giant of the proportions of a church tower&#8230; its glassy eyes large as plates. A boy in a tale entitled “The Big Man in the Tree” thought that he was looking at the trunk of a tree when it was a kapre’s leg instead. The kapre lives in that favorite home of lower mythical beings in the Philippines—the balete — as well as in other large trees. In some tales the kapre was said to “chirp like a bird.” The Zambales kapre was “most often seen sitting on a large branch and smoking a cigar as large as a man’s thigh.” <strong><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/origin-kapre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Learn more about the Kapre)</a></strong><br />

The kibaan’s long hair reached down to its feet and it was as “small as a child of two years.” The kibaan are said to keep house, to enjoy cooking in their kitchens after sunset, and to be generally near human habitations, especially at night. Zambales folk used to say that small trees and bushes on which fireflies habitually swarmed at night were the home of kibaan. A peculiar strong, spicy odor resembling that of crushed kakawate leaves emanating from the trees along country roads after sundown is said to come from kibaan kitchens.<br />

For every case you cite him of its errors, he quotes you numberless cases where its prophecies have come true, and ends by attributing the instance you cite to a false interpretation or to divine intervention that saved you from the evil prognosticated by the bird. Mandáyas, Mañgguáñgans, Debabáons, and Banuáons of the Agúsan Valley have practically the same beliefs as the Manóbos in regard to this omen bird. The omen bird is never killed, for to kill it would draw down unmitigated misfortune. On the contrary, it is often captured and is carefully fed and petted, especially when an inmate of the house is about to undertake a journey. The prospective traveler takes a little camote or banana and, placing it in the cage, addresses the captive bird and asks it to sing to its companions of the woods that they too in turn may sing to him the song of success and safe return.<br />

<p><strong>LUTAO </strong>&#8211; <em>(Samal, Mindanao) </em>The Samals are not above believing in ghosts, which they call lutao. They seem to have a definite concept of ghosts beyond merely shadowy<br />
apparitions. Anything frightening or smelling obnoxiously is attributed to ghosts. What becomes ghosts are the souls of notorious characters thieves, robbers, rapists, murderers, swindlers and the like. That they live in the mountains and cannot swim somehow reinforces their thinking that the lutao cannot be anything but Tausug.<br />

Arens described an attacking malakat in these words: <em>&#8220;In attacking a person, she assumes a horrible and frightful shape. Her long hair spreads all over her face. Her eyes turn fiery and her saliva flows from out of her mouth like long strings. Her nails grow long and sharp. As the fight begins, her hair crawls into the person&#8217;s nose, ears, mouth, and eyes, depriving him of his breath, voice, and sight. She grips the victim firmly on the arms and legs. With her sharp claws, she digs into the victim&#8217;s skin until it bleeds; if [she] has a weapon with her, she avoids the struggle and the victim might be killed; thereafter [she] feasts on the victim&#8217;s flesh.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong>MAMAMARAYA </strong>&#8211; <em>(Marinduque) </em>The mamamaraya’s forteis the swelling of a victim’s lips or abdomen causing a feeling of having devoured something heavy. Thiseffect can be achieved only with the placing of the worn and unwashed clothes of the intended victim, plus a piece of paper with magic phrases scribblings on it, inside a tightly sealed pot. The pot is then brought to the beach where it is buried in the sand. The victim’s stomach swells and ebbs with the tide. Note the similarity of this case with the paktol, a kind of witchcraft malady attributed to the Visayans.<br />

<p><strong>MAMBABARANG </strong> &#8211; <em>(Bicol)</em> The barang is a most feared form of witchcraft. So feared, in fact, that the people around which the witch circulates have no choice but to extend him due respect, if they do not want to be recipients of his dark art. In Bicol barrios Haguimit, Tambangan and Polongparang, Sta. Cruz, Marinduque, he is called mambabarang. Marinduque – though a little distant from Cebu – is one of the islands that constitute the Visayas group. A severe stomach ache, a big lump in the abdomen, an abnormal growth in the throat and windpipe and/or severe pains in the region of the heart – these are believed to be the harm caused by the mambabarang or barangan.</p>
<p>But the more common practice is through the use of insects. The controversial Povedano Manuscript of 1578, as written by Diego Lope Povedano, describes this more fully, to wit: The insect is called barang, and the man who can command the insect is called mambabarang. These animals (creatures) enter the body through any open places. This entry is invisible. The animals bite inside&#8230;. They may bite the liver, stomach, intestines, lungs&#8230;. The barang is kept in a bamboo tube&#8230; (Before sending an insect to attack someone) the sorcerer ties a thread to one of its rear legs. Signs of barang are discharge of blood; also, the stomach may swell and be painful.<br />

<p><strong>MANAGILUNOD </strong>&#8211; <em>(Ilokano) </em>The managilunod is not the dangerous type of witch.

<p><strong>MANANANEM </strong>&#8211; <em>(Pangasinan) </em>Black magic is the manananem’s forte, as had been proved and attested by a fish vendor’s sad experience. There was a woman who offered to buy one of her dalag (mud-fish). Because the offer was low and would mean losses on her part to accept it, she decided to reject it. After the passage of a day, she felt something irritating in her stomach. Days later, the feeling became more definite: it was now something live and moving. When it reached the point that she could bear it no longer, she consulted her ailment to a doctor. They operated on her stomach and extracted a live mudfish, a case that bewildered the doctors who performed the operation no end.<br />

<p><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/manananggal-wakwak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MANANANGGAL</strong> </a> &#8211; <em>(Tagalogs, Bikol)</em> A creature often confused with being a type of vampire is the manananggal, a creature rare in European folklore but fairly common in Southeast Asian traditions. Instead of sucking the victim’s blood, the manananggal is thought to suck his phlegm and viscera or otherwise extract the latter. The vampire may or may not be said to use a long tubular, pointed tongue for sucking blood, whereas the viscera sucker is solely interested in sucking the phlegm of her victims or extracting their internal organs, particularly the liver and the heart. In Hiligaynon and Waray, this being is most commonly referred to as the wak-wak. One report states that the manananggal “feed only on the liver and heart” of human victims and hover after nightfall about a house where a birth is expected. The croaking of a flock of crows is said to signal its presence.</p>
<p>When the male manananggal of the Bikol area is ready to take off, he goes in a hidden part of the house or a secluded field and then,&#8230; dipping his right hand into the foul-smelling ointment which he has prepared, [he] applies it in a line beginning from the tip of the little finger of his left hand, progressing [along] the length of the arm to the armpit, thence down his left side and the outer side of his left leg, ending at the tip of the little toe. Then the left hand is dipped into the chicken dung mixture and the process is duplicated on the right side of body. During the operation, [he] repeats to himself, but alone, the following formula or its equivalent: Siri, siri, daing Diyos kung banggi, labaw sa kahoyan, lagbas sa kasirongan! Literally translated, the formula reads: “Siri, siri, there is no God at night; over trees, under houses.”</p>
<p>A Manila editor introduced some sketches of mythological creatures made by Carlos V. Francisco with this observation: against the manananggal and the aswang, he arms himself with a whip of the stingray tail or spine of sawfish, and scent of garlic, and a pinch of salt. The manananggal and the aswang are cruel and voracious. There are nights when, with a red moon shining through the trees, the peasant fancies he hears the kapre laugh, its eyes fiery and its huge cigar lit, enjoying the talking of the bats.<br />

Toughies who commit the mistake of bullying a kin are often the unsuspecting victims of the mang-aamulit’s wares, which is in the form of long-healing, if incurable, sores on the part where it counts most: the knuckles.<br />

She is called mangalok in Palawan and the Visayas. Some folks say she sleeps in forest trees by day. She hooks herself to a top branch with her wings. She drapes her long hair over her pretty face. Then she sleeps soundly till nightfall. She flies out to the villages in the dark. Her favorite food is human liver and unborn babies. Women with child fear her very much. She sucks out the intestines of little children, too. She steals the liver of a corpse on the way to the grave.<br />

<p><strong>MANTIANAK</strong> &#8211; <em>(Tagakaulu Kalagan) </em>Spirits of unborn children—mantianak (sometimes referred to as Busau) — wander through the forest crying &#8220;ina-a-a&#8221; (mother), and often attack human beings. The only way persons thus assailed can hope to escape is by running to a stream and throwing water on the abdomens of their pursuers.<em><br />

<p><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/bagobo-buso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MANTIANAK </strong></a>&#8211; <em>(Bagobo)</em> The Mantianak, as everywhere, is associated with childbirth, but there are local variations. Bagobo tradition says that if a woman dies during her trial her spirit is angry at the husband, since he is held responsible for the conditions that caused his wife&#8217;s death. The ghost of the woman becomes a mantianak that hovers in the air near her former home and utters peculiar cries, resembling the mewing of a cat. When the man hears that sound at night, he knows that it is the voice of the mantianak of his dead wife. This form of buso is characterized by a hole in the breast and by the long claws, and it is called &#8220;a bad thing. &#8221; They say that the mantianak is constantly trying to kill men and boys, but that it is afraid of women and girls.<br />

People who have allegedly seen a Mantiw describe it as having a fair complexion, wide shoulders, and a tall aquiline nose. Also, a male Mantiw has an incredibly long penis and large, dangling scrotum. Although peaceful, a Mantiw is easily offended when a human whistles along with it. It will grab the nuisance human, carry him to the tallest coconut tree, and leave him on top with no means of climbing down.<br />

<p><strong>MUMU</strong> &#8211; <em>(Various) </em> In its simplest form, the Mumu is a malevolent spirit that lurks in darkened, shadowy corners waiting to snatch children away from their families. In the National Capital Region (Metro Manila), the most common belief is that the Mumu is a ghost or spirit that has unfinished business in our world, has not been given last rites, or have not yet accepted their death. As we move northward on Luzon the belief changes into a spirit that feeds on children or takes their soul. When we move south through the Philippines towards Bicol and the Eastern Visayas, the term Mumu is used to describe a variety of mythical beings and ‘engkanto’. The same can be said for Negros and Mindanao. In Iloilo, however, the Mumu is likened to the Tamawo.<br />

He looks after the welfare of the bagani, or warriors, and is in many respects similar to Mandarangan of the Bagobo. He is described as a gigantic man who always shows his teeth and is otherwise of ferocious aspect. A warrior seeing him is at once filled with a desire to kill. By making occasional offerings of pigs and rice it is usually possible to keep him from doing injury to a settlement, but at times these gifts fail of their purpose and many people are slain by those who serve him. Among the Mandaya, the balyan (baylan) plays an important role in their rituals, religious or otherwise. Offerings and libations are common practices. Offerings may be a bagi where pigs, chickens and other animals are offered to the diwata to ward off the evil spirits or busaw.<br />

<p><strong>MUTYA</strong> <em>&#8211; (Various) </em>In Pangasinan, the banana flower is pointed toward the sky when it emerges from the tree but bends earthward when its stem becomes sufficiently long. If you see a banana flower about to bend to the ground, wait under it at midnight when the moon is full. As it bends, it will simultaneously open and release a <em>mutya,</em> or magic jewel. Catch the <em>mutya</em> in your mouth as it falls and keep it there. The petioles of the banana tree will turn into human arms and its leaves into human hands and choke you into regurgitating the jewel. If you can keep it in your mouth till daylight, you will have great strength all your life.</p>
<p>The being that guarded the “stone,” also known as mutya among the Iloko and the Tagalog, of the banana blossom opening at midnight and facing east was said to be a particularly fierce character.</p>

<p>It is a common practice in Bohol barrios to determine God&#8217;s will for the sick. Sickness to the Boholanos may be caused by God&#8217;s will or by people living in a gakit (balite tree), or in rivers — the kataw (mermaid) etc. Mutya (a pearl-like stone) is placed on a plate to determine the will of God. If the pearl sticks to the plate when turned upside down, then the relatives spontaneously cry because the patient generally dies.<br />

The onglo is a human-like creature that has long straight black hair around its body from head to toe. It has clawed feet and long sharp fingernails, and long-pointy ears. Humans can detect an onglo because of the fetid smell. It feeds on the food that is left out to dry in the sun—like dried fish. The onglo is a creature whose upper body is that of a man, and the lower body is that of a horse. Its odor is so sharp that one can smell it from quite a distance. Onglo is a very black and ugly monster whose touch or mere presence causes one’s skin to itch.<br />

It looks like an innocent happy baby but when a human being gets near it, it reverts to its original form and devours the human so fast, and so viciously. The patiyanak is an ugly creature in its true form. It has reddish brown skin with sharp and glowing eyes. Its face is that of a very old man, and its teeth are long and sharp, protruding out of its mouth. The voice of patiyanak causes miscarriage. The patiyanak is an aborted fetus that comes to life to take revenge on its mother. The cry of the patiyanak, which resembles the cry of an infant, foretells that someone in the community is going to die. Patiyanak or tiyanak is also a nocturnal bird which no one can clearly describe, but it is believed to be the soul of an aborted or an unbaptized child since the sound it creates is like that of a crying baby. It can hurt you, or even eat you up. Where a patiyanak’s voice is heard above the house, an aswang lurks under. If the patiyanak’s voice is heard under the house, an aswang hovers above.<br />

<p><strong>PASATSAT </strong> &#8211; <em>(Pangasinan)</em> A ghost of a dead person who died in a tragic way, especially those who died in Japanese Era (World War II). This kind of ghost usually shows to passersby in a solitary paths in the forest or even in cities.

<p><strong>PATIANAK</strong> &#8211; <em>(Tagalog)</em> Writing about the traditional beliefs of the Tagalog toward the end of the sixteenth century, Plasencia reported in 1589 that he believed the patianak to be a “woman and child who died in childbirth”. A Batangas census official later wrote that “the patianac was the soul of a child dying before baptism” (Census [1903]), a concept with which Cole’s later findings in Mindanao are in substantial agreement. More logical is Juan R. Francisco’s comment: “In the myths of the Filipinos, the (pa)tiyanak is a small being who brings mischief to anyone who crosses his path. He cries like a baby to attract the attention of passersby. When the unfortunate man gets lost in the woods, he can not find his way home unless he makes the (pa)tiyanak laughs by wearing his clothes inside out.”<br />

<p><strong>PATIANAK </strong>&#8211; <em>(Kapampangan)</em> Small dark creatures that lived underground, in remote spots marked by termite mounds.

Thus, Kapampangans thought them to be the souls of unbaptized children, who tormented women during childbirth and harassed immoral people (like unchaste priests and unfaithful husbands).<br />

<p>The pugot seems to somewhat differ from the kapre in its ability to assume a variety of shapes—human or animal, such as dogs and hogs, though to be sure, this capacity is shown by other demons and the dwarf as well. As a child in San Antonio, Zambales, Socorro P. Buenaventura heard it said that a mysterious hog would rush between the legs of a wayfarer in a deserted street bordered by large acacia trees in her town and then would suddenly assume a gigantic shape and carry the traveler off.<br />

They appear and are seen only in the evening. They are invisible during the day. In the evening they stay under the house of a dying person.

He was attracted by her long hair and her charming smile and he walked to her. He then recalled a description of the sirena as a creature having a body covered with fish scales from the waist down, and he soon observed that “&#8230;like the body of a fish, her body was smaller at the end. Her tail fins flipped from side to side as they went through the water.” Later the mermaid described herself: “&#8230;half of my body is the body of a fish, and half is the body of a woman&#8230;” Informants from Zambales and elsewhere told Ramos that the sirena made the water rise quickly and engulfed her victim: “No sooner had his [the boy’s] feet touched the water than the river rose and the woman caught him in her arms.” Sirena is the Spanish equivalent of mermaid, and the term appears to have driven many of the vernacular terms out of use.<a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/sirena-mermaid-philippines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(learn more)</a><br />

<p><strong>SIYAM-SIYAM</strong> &#8211; <em>(Iloilo) </em>In mid to late 19th century Iloilo, travelers on horseback or carriage told of encountering a restless spirit at night. The spirit at first appeared as a normal human and asked to hitch a ride. On the way it would talk casually and confess of its nine sins that it committed nine times. Then the hitchhiker will turn into a skeleton in tatters and ask for the nearest church and disappear while the travelers screamed their heads off. In one story, Siyam-Siyam finally found peace when he encountered a friar.<br />

His hair is short, golden, and wavy. He lives in rivers, lakes, and in the sea. He is often seen in flooded waters. He floats along on the brown water. He looks for children swimming in the water. He pulls them under by the legs. Then he takes them to his home in the water. Merfolk are said to drown those who tell them they eat meat and fish. They also drown those who say they eat greens with curly tips. This is because merfolk are half meat and half fish. It&#8217;s also because merfolk have curly hair.<br />

<p><strong>TAIYABAN</strong><em> &#8211; (Ifugao)</em>The name of the class may possibly be derived from an ancient form of the word taiyap, meaning wing. These are the most feared, perhaps, of all deities. The Flying Monsters prey on the souls of men, carrying them off, it would seem, as eagles do their prey. They also prey on soul-stuff: for example, they devour that of the arm-then the arm will wither-or of the ear, and the hearing will be lost.</p>
<p>These beings are believed to live in rocks, thickets, trees and other natural features of landscapes all over the Ifugao&#8217;s known earth. They are, therefore, largely local, but there are also general ones. This class would be the most numerous of all if there were included in it those taiyaban that are of local character. Although the taiyaban is conceived as being usually bird-like, it sometimes &#8220;turns on the fire&#8221; and appears as a flame or apparition of fire. It also frequently assumes human form. Dogs can perceive it when human eyes cannot, and if dogs bark without apparent reason, it is believed that they are barking at a flying monster that has come into the village.<br />

The tambaloslos is a black, lanky creature with wobbly legs. Its body is almost skin and bones. Its huge, fleshy and protruding lips extend from one ear to the other. To drive the tambaloslos away, one has to tickle it. This will force it to laugh and make its huge lips draw onto its face; and since. its lips are so huge, they cover its eyes when it laughs. These descriptions seem to be the &#8216;G&#8217; rated versions of the being below.<br />

Has a scary, evil laugh. Makes people who walk through the forest lost. The more lost its victim is the harder it laughs. If you put your clothes inside out the tambaloslos finds it so funny it will laugh so hard it will cover its eyes with its enormous upper lip, giving the victim a chance to escape.</p>
<p>Tambaloslos is a slang word in the Cebuano language. It is used to mean a useless or an inept male. It is seldom used to refer to a woman. It is a vulgar word and is not used in polite or formal conversation. Occasionally people say it to elicit a humorous effect. The suffix “loslos “is a slang term for the male genitalia.</p>
<p>“<i>Tambaloslos kang daku</i>!” is a saying in Cebuano that is similar to “You’re such a dimwit!”.</p>
<p><strong>From Bikol: </strong>It got its name from the long, wrinkled penis and dangling testicles which dangles to the ground (luslus).</p>
<p>An awkward, lanky, wrinkled black creature, it has long, thin, wobbly legs, hooves and big joints. It has long, thin arms and fingers and a mane like that of a horse that went all the way down from the head to the buttocks. It has wide protruding lips that covers its face when it laughs.</p>
<p>The Tambaluslus hides under trees on moonlit nights and loves to chase people who are lost in the woods.</p>
<p>‘luslus’ which means ‘loose and hanging’.</p>
<p><strong>Also from Bikol: </strong>A tall humanoid creature. Generally black in complexion, it has long and thin legs with big joints, hooves, long thin arms and fingers, and a mane that runs from the back of the head down to its buttocks. It also has wide protruding lips like an ape. Another strange feature of this creature are its long wrinkled penis and loose testicles which dangle near the ground.</p>
<p>The Tambaluslos chases people who wander in the woods. The only way to escape it is to take off your clothes and wear them upside-down. The creature finds this act very hilarious and it will laugh so much that its wide lips would cover its face, therefore preventing it from seeing the victim who in turn will have ample time to escape.</p>
<p><strong>Bicol, Bisaya, Mindanao: </strong>from ‘luslos’ or to have an erection</p>
<p>Takes women into secluded areas. To escape ones must turn their clothes inside out so that the tambaloslos can see their breast, this will make the tambaloslos erect so much that its genitals will cover its vision.<br />

He is so powerful that every time he open and closes his eyes lightening flashes. He lives in a large hole at the bottom of the ocean. When the tide goes out, it is because he has left the hole and the water rushes in to fill it. His moving about causes great waves which crash on the shore. The crab is quarrelsome, like his father; and sometimes becomes so angry with his mother (the Moon), that he tries to swallow her.<br />

Upon perceiving the first evidences of darkness upon the face of the moon, the men rush out from the houses, shout, shoot arrows toward the moon, slash at trees with their bolos, play the drum and gong, beat tin cans and the buttresses of trees, blow bamboo resounders and dance around wildly, at the same time giving forth yells of defiance at the monster saying, &#8220;Let loose our moon,&#8221; &#8220;You will be hit by an arrow.&#8221; The women at the same time keep sticking needles or pointed sticks in the wall in the direction of the enemy that is trying to envelop the moon. Some say that a huge scorpion is the cause of eclipses. The explanation of these curious proceedings is simple. If the moon does not become freed from the clutches of this gigantic creature, it is believed that there will be no dawn and that, in the eternal darkness that will subsequently fall upon the world, the evil spirits will reign and all human apparel will be turned into snakes. During the eclipse the priests never cease to call upon their deities for aid against the mighty tarantula that is menacing the moon.<br />

<p><strong><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/tikbalang-documentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TIKBALANG</a></strong> &#8211; <em>(Tagalogs and other regions)</em> The abundance of literature about the tikbalang indicates its firm grip on the imagination of the folk. The name itself is Tagalog and there is no other early report about it from other regions in the country except, curiously, from the Negrito around Mount Pinatubo in the Zambales range and in the Baler area in Quezon Province. In the Pinatubo area, two mythical creatures known as the tulung (or tuwung) and the binangunan have an unmistakable physical resemblance to the tikbalang of the Tagalogs. Of the tulung, Fox wrote: “This spirit is usually described as being horselike, but having clawed feet, long hair, and very large testicles.”18 The binangunan, too, “looked somewhat like a horse, but there was a fire on its back from head to tail.” Damian Amazona, writing about the Negrito along the eastern periphery of Luzon, defined the binangenan [sic] as “the spirits who bring down danger, sickness, and death as punishment. Their home is the balete tree.” A tikbalang that is said to have kidnapped and murdered one of the belles at a grand ball in Manila hundreds of years ago—on the night of April 15, 1580, to be exact—was described as a “tall, hideous creature dressed in a dark tunic&#8230; its long straight hair flowing over its shoulders and with the wrinkled yellow feet of a bird.” It wore a dark cloak that hung down to its knees, and it had horse’s legs.</p>
<p>An Augustinian parish priest of Parañaque, Calumpit, and Tambobong registered the following complaint about his parishioners: The tigbalang [sic] is another of the things of which they are greatly afraid. It is a kind of ghost which they say appears to them in the form of an animal or of some unknown monster and forces them to do things contrary to the laws of our religion.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the tikbalang as a group have been described thus: They have bodies like those of men, but their heads are similar to those of horses. Their limbs are said to be so long that when they sit their knees reach above their heads. When they laugh, all you can see is mouth. A tikbalang could assume the form of an old man, of a horse, or of “a monster.” An investigator who gathered his data from Filipino laborers in Alaskan salmon canneries reported: “The tikbalang is&#8230; always seen as a tall, thin and black man with a horse’s head and terrible teeth.”<br />

<p><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/tikbalang-documentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>TIKBALANG </b></a>&#8211; <em>(Bicol)</em> Tikbalang is a tall, thin and dark creature that is half human and half horse. While it may have the entire stature of a man, its upper body and face are unmistakably akin to a horse. During full moon he goes out to take a bath and dips his long legs in the river. The tikbalang is a horse-like man. This tall creature has long bony limbs that are disproportioned. When squatting, its knees are taller than its head. It has clawed feet and long hair, with a large mouth, teeth, and huge testicles. The tikbalang is the culprit behind people who get lost in the woods or in the forest. When the tikbalang misleads people in the forest, they are, more often than not, not found again. A person who gets hold of one of the tikbalang’s spines can use it as an anting-anting and makes the tikbalang his slave.<br />

<p><strong>TIKTIK </strong> &#8211; <em>(Eastern Visayas) </em>The viscera sucker of the Eastern Visayas is said to supplement its staple food of human viscera with discarded human phlegm and the tender flesh of small children and to work with the cooperation of its avian scout, the tictic: They [early Filipinos] assert that the bird tictic is the pander of the sorcerer called usang. Flying ahead of that being, the bird shows it the houses where infants are bom. That being takes its position on the roof of the neighboring house and thence extends its tongue in the form of a thread which it inserts through the anus of the child and by that means sucks its entrails and kills it.<br />

<p><strong>TIYANAK</strong> &#8211; <em>(Various) </em>Perhaps the best described dwarf in Philippine folklore is the tianak, called patianak by the Tagalogs and by the Mandaya of Eastern Mindanao, where it has been defined as: <em>&#8220;&#8230;the spirit of a child whose mother died while pregnant, and who for this reason was born in the ground&#8230; The belief in a similar spirit known as muntianak is widespread throughout the Southern Philippines.&#8221; </em>When first encountered, the tianak looked like “a naked newborn baby,&#8221; “a very plump baby lying on the side leaf of a banana plant. Two boys who once found a tianak “lifted him up and kissed him many times.”When fondled, the infant-seeming creature suddenly turned into a little old man with an old man’s face, wrinkled skin, long beard, and mustache. It had a flat nose, its eyes were the size of a peseta coin, and its right leg was much shorter than the other, so that the creature had to move around by leaps. The tianak are said to “take a mischievous delight in misdirecting travelers.” One of them “laughed ha-ha- ha. I fooled you. I fooled you. And disappeared.” In the tale “The Devil-Child,” a tianak cried “Uha-ah! Uha- ah!” like a human infant to attract passersby and it had “the happy voice of a baby at play.” The tianak were capable of being outwitted. If a man lost his way and turned his clothes inside out.<br />

<p><strong>TIYU-AN</strong> &#8211; <em>(Location of belief is unclear) </em>According to Nid Anima, the tiyu-an, is a type of aswang who stays on the ground and does not have the power to fly but can transform into a pig. They keep puppies which are usually passed on to them by their parents, and these puppies are eternal puppies because they never grow old, they never get to be dogs ever. These puppies are the principals, or masters, in the sense that it’s they who holds the power, and the tiyu-an is just their slave. When they perform the ritual of licking him, the message being sent across is for the tiyu-an to prey. This is a departure and contradiction in terms from the universal trait of witchcraft as practiced in almost all other parts of the world wherein animals are just familiars or slaves to do the bidding of the master, which is the witch.<br />

<p><strong>TULUNG/ TUWUNG</strong> &#8211; <em>(Mt. Pinatubo Negrito)</em> “This spirit is usually described as being horselike, but having clawed feet, long hair, and very large testicles.” The dread with which the Pinatubo Negrito regarded the <em>tulung</em> variety of the tikbalang is indicated by the following account by an anthropologist who lived two years with them after World War II: &#8220;Specific areas may become uninhabitable through the invasion of an evil spirit or spirits. One extensive region on the lower and eastern slopes of Mt. Liwitan, formerly good for clearing, hunting, and for gathering forest products, is now the sole property of the huge evil spirit, tulung (<em>tuwung</em>) in Botolan. A few years ago a group of Negritos from Villar had been gathering rattan in this area, when they noticed that many of the plants, even large trees, had been violently torn from the ground. Later, they heard loud, strange noises, and fled in terror. Today, no Negrito would wittingly enter the region.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong><a href="https://www.aswangproject.com/bagobo-buso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAK-WAK</a> </strong>&#8211; <em>(Bagabo)</em> An efficacious charm to drive away the mythical bird called wak-wak is the use of a suggestive formula. The wak-wak is a rapacious bird resembling a crow that flies headless, but having four legs, two of which are covered with claws, and it flies over the country at night, hunting for living men as its prey. The magic spell is as follows : When you hear the sound of the bird&#8217;s voice shrieking, &#8221; Wak-wak ! wak-wak ! &#8221; you must call to him : &#8221; I am not fat ; I am skinny. I eat rotten wood. I eat baguiang.&#8221; Then the wakwak cannot hurt you ; but you must speak again, saying, &#8220;You go on to Bago ; there are many fat men there.&#8221; By means of this spell, such unpleasant suggestions are flung at the evil bird as to induce him to seek prey elsewhere. If the baguiang leaf is chewed, it is said to give itching lips and to leave a bad taste in the mouth.<br />

Fearful that Wirwir would eat the corpses, the native priests placated him. According to an account, the house of Wirwir, an Apayao ghoulish creature, was found in a forest in Mount Anay and consisted of “a cave full of valuable properties taken from the graves of dead persons.”<br />

<p><strong>WUWUG</strong> &#8211;<em> (Calapi, Westrn Samar)</em>Mang Juan had two sons, Jose and Pedro. One night Pedro and Mang Juan went fishing while Jose stayed home. Pedro was talking to his father, and when he turned to him he saw his head with the intestines dangling from it, shining like a thousand fireflies just a few feet above him. And he realized that his father was the wuwug rumored to be going around at midnight. He kept it a secret but Pedro&#8217;s two friends who came from serenading saw it, too. They put crabs into the wuwug&#8217;s body. When the wuvmg joined his body, he wiggled and wiggled until he died. But before he died, he gave his wuwug-ness to Pedro, much against Pedro&#8217;s wishes. And Pedro, because of great shame and not wanting to kill anybody, drowned himself in quicksand. Jose, his brother, sells balinghoy [cassava cakes] in the market. Nobody buys his merchandise during Lent because it is the belief that during this time wuwug appear.<br />

<p><strong>YASAO </strong>– <em>(Bicol)</em> They also had the beings of evil, and to whom they looked with the utmost terror and respect, the Yasao, a kind of horrible spirit that was presented to them on moonlit nights in the shade of the trees. When their appearance occurred, if at the same time they heard shouts or presumed to hear them, it was a sign that some of them were going to die soon, because the Asuang would be on the prowl. The Yasao that we have been talking about sometimes also becomes Laqui , a monster with goat hair and feet and the face of an ugly man. In that state he roamed wandering through the forests, as if punished by the Asuang, in pain of his indolence in persecuting men, without being able to harm anyone.<br />

His interest in Philippine myth and folklore began in 2004. Finding it difficult to track down resources on the topic, he founded The Aswang Project in 2006. Shortly after, he embarked on a 5 year journey, along with producing partner Cheryl Anne del Rosario, to make the 2011 feature length documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbmDHXMBMtM">THE ASWANG PHENOMENON</a> &#8211; an exploration of the aswang myth and its effects on Philippine society. In 2015 he directed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml4eO0dfzpg">&#8220;The Creatures of Philippine Mythology&#8221;</a> web-series, which features 3 folkloric beings from the Philippines &#8211; the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRUSBSJ39KY">TIKBALANG</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUrxlu1J0N8"> KAPRE</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6xZNFvPklo">BAKUNAWA</a>. Episodes are available to watch on YouTube. Jordan recently oversaw the editing for the English language release of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DICTIONARY-PHILIPPINE-MYTHOLOGY-Diccionario-TRANSLATIONS/dp/1777275806/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Filipino+Dictionaries&amp;qid=1620705553&amp;sr=8-1">Ferdinand Blumentritt&#8217;s DICCIONARIO MITOLÓGICO DE FILIPINAS (Dictionary of Philippine Mythology)</a> and is working on two more releases with fellow creators scheduled for release later this year.

Flag abolished 17th December <a href="om1970.html">1970</a></p>

<p>Until the 19th century the <a href="ae-.html">Gulf emirates'</a> monochrome red flags were undifferentiated, but then they added white borders, hoists, stripes, script, etc.. In 1820 the British asked Gulf Emirs who were friendly to them and entered into <a href="ae1820tr.html">special treaty</a> relationship with them to put white onto their traditional red Muslim flags. (...) That treaty was the 'truce' that changed the <em>Pirate Coast</em> to the <em>Trucial Coast</em> (or <em>Trucial Oman</em> as it was sometimes misleadingly called).<em><br>
James Dignan, Josh Fruhlinger, Ed Haynes</em> and <em>Ole Andersen</em>, 1995-1997</p>

<p>Oman also used a pure red flag until <a href="om1970.html">1970</a>, when horizontal stripes of white and green have been added.<em><br>
&#381;eljko Heimer</em>, 22 November 1995</p>

<p>The plain red flag was replaced by the four-coloured one when present Sultan Qaboos took the power, in <a href="om1970.html">1970</a>.<em><br>
Joan-Franc&eacute;s Blanc</em>, 11 May 1998</p>

<p>Seems me that the Imamate used plain white flag. The Arabic inscription was added later in the flag of the "State of Oman".<em><br>
Jaume Oll&eacute;</em>, 6 April 1998</p>

<p><em>&#381;eljko Heimer</em> wrote, <em>"Oman used a pure red flag until 1970"</em>, not explaining that there was no 'Oman' at that time. The name of the state with the red flag was 'Muscat and Oman'. Muscat had ruled Eastern Arabia, not <a href="#ima">Oman</a>. <a href="#ima">Oman</a> was the interior part, ruled by an Imam, who never ruled in Muscat. When they both cooperated the name was changed to 'Muscat and Oman', and after the defeat of the <a href="#ima">Imam</a>, Sultan Qaboos changed the state's name to simply 'Oman'. It is important not to confuse both names, as the seafaring nation, once ruling <a href="tz-zz90.html#om">Zanzibar</a>, the 
<a href="km.html">Comoros</a> and other islands, was Muscat and not Oman!<em><br>

<p>According to P. Lux-Wurm, <em>Les drapeaux de l'Islam</em> [<a href="bib-lua.html#lux01">lux01</a>], ships carrying pilgrims to Mecca were granted a special ensign with a green rectangle placed at fly. Lux-Wurm's book seems to be full of approximate, unverified, and very often utterly wrong vexillological information. In most cases, the flags shown have not been crosschecked in reference source books and other sources. I would advise to consider all flags shown in this book as 'to be confirmed elsewhere'.<em><br>

<h2><a name="1868">Imamate of Muscat and Oman 1868 to 1871</a></h2>

<p>Since the year 750 CE Oman (or rather Muscat &amp; Oman) was flew a plain red 
flag and did so until December 17, 1970, the beginning of QE (Sultan Qaboos 
Era). But there was a short period in Omani (or Muscatian) history when things 
were different. (Quoting from Dr. Whitney Smith article on Omani new flag - The 
Flag Bulletin XXXIV:6/167 November-December 1995):<br>
&quot;The 1866 assassination of Thuwaini, sultan of Muscat, allowed another member of 
the family, Azzam bin Qais, to seize power in Oman in 1868. Under his rule, 
which lasted until 1871, the country was considered an imamate rather than the 
sultanate since Azzam preferred the religious title which the rulers of Muscat 
had held since the first imam/sultan was elected in 750 CE (or AD). During those 
years, the plain white imamate flag served as the national flag of Muscat and 
Oman. The red flag was restored when Turki (Qaboos' great-great grandfather) 
came to power in 1871 and re-established his father's sultanate.&quot;<br>
To add to the general confusion, Oman was an inland area of the Sultanate of 
Muscat and Oman and enjoyed considerable autonomy from Muscat flying the white 
flag of its imam since the separation of functions (imam's and sultan's) in 1724 
until 1959 when things took a new direction and the State of Oman, hostile to 
Muscat, was declared and hoisted a refreshingly colorful flag (two colors) in 
place of previous plain ones. But that's the next story, a little later. On top 
of all of this, the Muscato-Omani fleet was flying in a period from 1844 to 
circa 1910 ...the French maritime ensign (with permission, of course) just to 
annoy the British. The last ones, not amused at this practice, forced the end to 
the charade around 1910 and all Muscato-Omani ships, from Zanzibar to Gwadar, 
were happily sailing again under the plain red ensign of the sultanate.<br>

<p>The flag of the Imamate of Oman was in fact white with a red sword and above it a red inscription. This flag can be seen on coins etc. The flag was white in contrast to the <a href="#top">red flag of Muscat</a>. (...) Muscat had ruled Eastern Arabia, not Oman. Oman was the inner part, ruled by an Imam, who never ruled in Muscat. (...) The Imamate of Oman was not in "the interior of Oman", but it was in the interior of Eastern Arabia, surrounded in the north, east and south by the sultanate of Muscat. One could write, "the Imamate of Oman was a rarely-recognized state in the interior of what is today Oman".<em><br>
Ralf Stelter</em>, 17 April 1999</p>

<p>According to a German text [from <a href="bib-fba.html#fbn"><em>Flaggenmitteilungen</em></a> ?] submitted by <em>Jaume Oll&eacute;</em>, "the Imamate of Oman formerly flew a white flag with a red inscription <em>Victory of God and speedy fulfillment</em> and thereunder a horizontal red sword."<em><br>
John S. Ayer</em>, 11 September 1999</p>
<p>The Arabic is &quot;nasr min-illah wa fatih qarib,&quot; which actually means &quot;Victory 
is from God and conquest is near.&quot; This is the same motto contained on the flag 
of the ruler of <a href="in-bahaw.html#emir">Bahawalpur</a>.<br>

<p>This is one of my favourite country flags: the short lived sultanate of Suhar. In a letter from <em>Nozomi Kariyasu</em> the black and white image is labelled "flag attributed to Oman 1923-1943" (in this era Oman was composed by the sultanate of Muskat and the imamate of Oman). The Sib Treaty pushed Muscat under <a href="gb-colon.html">British</a> protectorate and recognized the pre-eminency of the Sultan over the Iman. But I agree with <em>Whitney Smith</em>'s opinion, who believes that the flag was the one of the Suhar sultanate. Around 1920, Sheik Ali Banu Bu Ali, a relative of the Muscat sultan, revolted in Suhar and proclaimed himself Sultan (of Oman?). Bu Ali was deposed by the British in 1932. The flag appear in charts attributed to Oman until 1943, but I believe that in fact it was out of use after 1932 and the charts only show a flag taken from an older chart... The name in the flags seems to be 'Oman' which discards the official name of Muscat. It is well known that the Imam's flag was plain white in these years.<em><br>
Jaume Oll&eacute;</em>, 12 December 1999</p>

<p>It seems that someone, sometime made a mistake in writing 'Oman'. Oman is spelt 'ayin-mim-alif-nun' whereas the name on the flag is 'alif-waw-mim-alif-nun' which would be 'Auman'. You can compare the flag to the correct name as it appears on <a href="../misc/om'txt.jpg">this image</a> from an Omani official site.<em><br>
Dov Gutterman</em>, 13 December 1999</p>

<h2><a name="hist">A history of Muscat and Oman</a></h2>

<p>1913 - Sultan Faisal died. Imam of Oman refuses to pay allegiance to the new 
sultan, Timur. Civil war follows.<br>
1920 - Treaty of Sib. Sultan controls Muscat and the coastal areas. Imam in 
control of inland territory (capital: Nizwa) with increased autonomy, but lacks 
international recognition.&nbsp; <br>
1954 - New Imam, Ghalib bin Ali and his brother Talib seek international 
recognition and complete independence of Oman from Muscat. British troops 
subdued them somewhat, but Nasser's UAR give them full support. Conflict extends 
to Buraimi Oasis, taken by British on behalf of the Muscati sultan.<br>
1959 - Imam's military defeat. Termination of Treaty of Sib. Increased efforts 
of Omani rebels, holding in the desert, for UN recognition of the State of Oman. 
<a href="#ima">Change of the flag</a>. Realizing that outside world might interpret the white flag 
as a sign of surrender, the savvy Omanis add red sword (or dagger) and red 
Koranic inscription: &quot;aid from God and prompt&nbsp; victory&quot; making it a bicolor 
flag. <br>
1970 - Sultan Qaboos manages to take total control of Imam of Oman territory and 
moves to suppress the Dhofar revolt</p>

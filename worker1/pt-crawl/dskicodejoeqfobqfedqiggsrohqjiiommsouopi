<p>In today's networked world, IBM maintains a strong and unique presence in Canada, making important contributions to this country's economy, technology leadership and the communities where we live and work.  
</p>

<p>
IBM is one of the largest technology, services and consulting organizations in Canada. We help clients of all sizes and in all industries transform their operations through the use of technology, infusing intelligence into the systems that run our businesses, our society and the world.  
</p>

<p>
This intelligence makes it possible to harness the vast amount of data created by the trillions of connected devices in today's world, and turn it into knowledge that can be used to anticipate, forecast and even predict changes in our systems. This is the vision behind IBM's Smarter Planet strategy.   
</p>

<p>
Canada is home to the largest team of IBM software professionals outside of the United States. Our software development lab sites in Markham, London, Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Vancouver and Victoria—collectively known as the IBM Canada Lab—are responsible for delivering IBM software solutions that are used worldwide.  
</p>

<p>
Our Bromont, Quebec manufacturing plant is IBM's largest semiconductor packaging and test facility and one of Canada's leading exporters. In addition to packaging and testing IBM products such as the new POWER7 chip (the most powerful chip ever produced by IBM), Bromont performs custom assembly and testing for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), including packaging the chips used in today's most popular home gaming consoles.
</p>

<p>
Since opening our first Canadian office in 1917, IBM has been a model corporate citizen, supporting communities across the country through corporate grant programs, volunteerism, education initiatives such as IGNITE (Igniting Interest in Technology &amp; Engineering) camps for Aboriginal youth, and our annual employees' charitable fund campaign.  
</p>

<p>
We have also introduced programs that allow employees to have an impact on a global scale. In 2009, 24 Canadians participated in the IBM Corporate Service Corps, a program that allows employees to visit developing countries to work on short-term community projects.  Another 20 Canadians are expected to take part in this unique global leadership development opportunity in 2010.
</p>

<p>
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion, which internally ensures an understanding, respectful and accommodating workplace, also extends to the community. And from an environment perspective, we strive to minimize the potential impact of our own operations, while applying our technology and services to help our clients and partners do the same.
</p>

<p>
As a company, IBM's actions are driven by three core values: Dedication to every client's success; Innovation that matters, for our company and for the world; and, Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships. These values, which were determined by IBM employees globally, shape everything we do as we strive to make Canada and the world work better.

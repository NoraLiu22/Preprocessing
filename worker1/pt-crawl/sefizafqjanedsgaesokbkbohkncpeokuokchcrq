</font></center><p>



Extending across most of northern New England into the southern part of
the Canadian Maritimes, the Abenaki called their homeland Ndakinna meaning
&quot;our land.&quot; The eastern Abenaki were concentrated in Maine east of New
Hampshire's White Mountains, while the western Abenaki lived west of the
mountains across Vermont and New Hampshire to the eastern shores of Lake
Champlain. The southern boundaries of the Abenaki homeland were near the
present northern border of Massachusetts excluding the Pennacook country
along the Merrimack River of southern New Hampshire. The maritime Abenaki
occupied the St. Croix and the St. John's River Valleys near the border
between Maine and New Brunswick. New England settlement and war forced
many of the Abenaki to retreat north into Quebec where two large
communities formed at St. Francois and Becancour near Trois-Rivieves.
These have continued to the present-day. There are also three reservations
in northern Maine (Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, and Maliseet) and seven
Maliseet reserves located in New Brunswick and Quebec. Other groups of
Abenaki, without reservations, are scattered across northern New Hampshire
and Vermont.<p>

</font></center><p>
Before contact the Abenaki (excluding the Pennacook and Micmac) may have
numbered as many as 40,000 divided roughly between 20,000 eastern; 10,000
western; and 10,000 maritime. Due to early contacts with European
fishermen, at least two major epidemics hit the Abenaki during the 1500s:
an unknown sickness sometime between 1564 and 1570; and typhus in 1586.
The major blow came in the decade just prior to English settlement of
Massachusetts in 1620, when three separate epidemics swept across New
England and the Canadian Maritimes. Maine was hit very hard during 1617
(75% mortality), and the population of the eastern Abenaki fell to about
5,000. The western Abenaki were more isolated and suffered relatively
less, losing perhaps half of their original population. The new diseases
continued to take their toll: <blockquote>smallpox 1631, 1633, and 1639;<br> unknown
epidemic 1646;<br> influenza 1647;<br> smallpox 1649;<br> diphtheria 1659;<br> smallpox
1670;<br> influenza 1675;<br> smallpox 1677 and 1679;<br> smallpox and measles 1687;<br>
and smallpox 1691, 1729, 1733, 1755, and 1758.</blockquote>

The Abenaki population continued to decline, but after 1676 they absorbed
thousands of refugees from southern New England displaced by settlement
and the King Philip's War. As a result, descendents of almost every
southern New England Algonquin (Pennacook, <!-- Link Tag --><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411025556/http://www.dickshovel.com/Narra.html">Narragansett</a>, Pocumtuc, <!-- Link Tag --><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411025556/http://www.dickshovel.com/nipmuc.html">Nipmuc</a>)
can still be found among the Abenaki, especially the Sokoki (western
Abenaki). After another century of war and disease, there were less than
1,000 Abenaki remaining after the American Revolution. The population has
currently recovered to almost 12,000 on both sides of the border. Within
the United States, the Abenaki are not, and never have been, federally
recognized as a tribe. However, three component tribes in Maine:
Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet, have this
status.<p>

The Penobscot have a reservation on Indian Island at Old Town, Maine and a
tribal membership near 2,000. The Passamaquoddy number about 2,500 on three
Maine reservations, Pleasant Point, Peter Dana Point, and Indian Township,
while the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians have close to 600. There are also
seven Maliseet bands in Canada (470 in Quebec and 2,000 in New Brunswick) for
a total of 3,000. Canada also has 400 Abenakis de Wolinak (Becancour) on a
reserve near Trois-Rivieres, Quebec and almost 1,500 at Odanak (St. Francois)
30 miles to the southwest. The other Abenaki are scattered among the general
populations of Quebec, New Brunswick, and northern New England. Currently
there about 2,500 "Vermont Abenaki" in both Vermont and New Hampshire but
concentrated in northwest Vermont near Lake Champlain. Organized as the
Sokoki-St. Francis Band of the Abenaki Nation, a tribal council was
established in 1976 at Swanton, Vermont. State recognition was granted that
year but later withdrawn. In 1982 they applied for federal recognition which
is still pending.<p><table border="0" width="100" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" align="left">

</font></center><p>
The Abenaki called themselves Alnanbal meaning &quot;men.&quot; The name &quot;Abenaki&quot; -
spelled variously as: Abenaqui, Abnaki, Alnanbal, Benaki, Oubenaki,
Wabanaki, Wippanap - originated from a Montagnais (Algonquin) word meaning
&quot;people of the dawn&quot; or &quot;easterners.&quot; Indiscriminately applying their name
for the <!-- Link Tag --><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411025556/http://www.dickshovel.com/Mahican.html">Mahican</a> to all Algonquin south of the St. Lawrence, the French
frequently referred to the eastern Abenaki as Loup (wolves) - or more
formally as the Natio Luporem or Wolf Nation. The French, However, called
the western Abenaki the Sokoki. Borrowing the name of the southern New
England Algonquin for Abenaki, the English at first used Tarrateen for
both Abenaki and Micmac. Later, Tarrateen came to mean only the Micmac,
and Abenaki the tribes of northern Maine. The Sokoki, or western Abenaki,
were known in New England as the St Francis Indians. Other names for the
Abenaki were: Anagonges (Iroquois), Aquannaque (Huron), Bashaba,
Gannongagehronnon (Mohawk), Moassones, Maweshenook, Narankamigdok,
Natsagana (Caughnawaga), Obunego; Onagunga, Onnogonges, Opanango,
Owenagunges, Owenunga, and Skacewanilom (Iroquois).<p>

 <center><font size="5"><font color="#660000">Language</font>
</font></center><p>
Algonquin, but distinct from the languages of the Micmac to the north and
the New England Algonquin to the south. There was also a dialectic
difference between the eastern and western Abenaki with language of the
western Abenaki being closer to that of the Pennacook.<p>

 <center><font size="5"><font color="#660000">Culture</font> 
</font></center><p>
Native Americans have occupied northern New England for at least 10,000
years. There is no proof these ancient residents were ancestors of the
Abenaki, but there is no reason to think they were not. The Abenaki lived
in a manner similar to Algonquin in southern New England. Since they
relied on agriculture (corn, beans, and squash) for a large part of their
diet, villages were usually located on the fertile floodplains of rivers.
Depending on location and population, some of their cultivated fields were
extensive. Missisquoi, on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, reportedly
had more than 250 acres of corn under cultivation. Agriculture was
supplemented by hunting, fishing, and the gathering of wild foods. The
relative importance of fish/seafood depended on location. In areas of poor
soil, fish were often used as fertilizer to increase the yield of corn.<p>

For most of the year, the Abenaki lived in scattered bands of extended
families, each of which occupied separate hunting territories inherited
through the father. Unlike the Iroquois, the Abenaki (and most New England
Algonquin) were patrilineal. In spring and summer, bands would gather at
fixed locations near rivers, or the seacoast, for planting and fishing.
These summer villages were sometimes fortified depending on the warfare in
the area. Compared with Iroquois settlements, most Abenaki villages were
fairly small, averaging about 100 persons, but there were exceptions -
particularily among the western Abenaki. Some Abenaki used an oval-shaped
long house, but most favored the dome-shaped, bark-covered (sometimes
woven mat) wigwam during the warmer months. During winter, the Abenaki
moved farther inland and separated into small groups of conical,
bark-covered wigwams shaped like the buffalo-hide tepee of the plains.<p>

Abenaki is actually a geographical and linguistic (rather than political)
grouping. Before contact individual tribes were the usual level of
political organization. Occasionally several tribes would unite under a
powerful sachem for purposes of war, but the Abenaki were noteworthy for
their general lack of central authority. Even at the tribal level, the
authority of their sachems was limited, and important decisions, such as
war and peace, usually required a meeting of all adults. The Abenaki
Confederacy did not come into existence until after 1670 and then only in
response to continuous wars with the Iroquois and English colonists. Even
this did not change things, and reports of French military officers are
filled with complaints that Abenaki leaders usually had difficulty
controlling their warriors.<p>

In many ways the lack of central authority served the Abenaki well. In
times of war, the Abenaki could abandon their villages, separate into
small bands, and regroup in a distant refuge beyond the reach of their
enemies. It was a strategy that confounded repeated efforts by both the
Iroquois and English to conquer them. The Abenaki could just melt away,
regroup, and then counterattack. It was an effective strategy in times of
war, but it has left the impression that the Abenaki were nomads. Since
the Abenaki usually retreated to Canada during war, New England came to
think of them as Canadian Indians - which, of course, they were not - but
it served as an excuse to take most of their land in Maine, New Hampshire,
and Vermont without compensation. Only the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy
signed treaties and kept some of their land. The other Abenaki were
dispossessed and remain unrecognized. However, there was no &quot;ride into the
sunset.&quot; Largely invisible over the years, the Abenaki have remained in
their homeland by living in scattered, small bands. New England has
numerous romantic monuments which celebrate the disappearance of its
original residents. Misleading, since they never really left!<p>

 <center><font size="5"><font color="#660000">History</font> 
</font></center><p>
Within a few years after the voyage of Sebastian Cabot in 1497, European
fishing fleets began regular visits to the Grand Banks and the coast of
Maine. Giovanni da Verrazano also explored the area during 1524. These
initial contacts between Abenaki and Europeans eventually gave rise to a
rumor which circulated through 16th century Europe of Norumbega, a rich
and powerful native kingdom in northern Maine. Like the fabled Seven
Cities of Cibola which lured Spanish Conquistadors into the American
Southwest, Europeans never found the mythical Norumbega. They did,
however, discover something of great value ...fur. The profits from the
fur trade with Native Americans prompted French merchants to sent the
expeditions that established the first permanent European outposts in the
region.<p>

Samuel de Champlain and Pierre De Monts built Fort St. John at the mouth
of the St. Croix River in 1604 marking the beginning of a steady trade in
furs with the Penobscot and Maliseet. Unfortunately, the French had chosen
a bad location for their first outpost, and after a year of floods, cold,
and starvation, they moved across the Bay of Fundy to Port Royal (Nova
Scotia). Although this area belonged to the Micmac, the French fur trade
with Abenaki continued. The Penobscot prospered from this and, with the
advantage of European trade goods, began to dominate the other tribes of
Abenaki to the south and west. Under the leadership of their sachem
Bashaba, the Penobscot were able to form a powerful alliance which
threatened the Micmac across the bay. There appears to have been an
earlier hostility between these two peoples, which competition for trade
with the French only aggravated. By 1607 the rivalry escalated into the
Tarrateen War between the Penobscot confederacy under Bashaba and the
Micmac and their Maliseet allies.<p>

This war continued with few interruptions for eight years. Meanwhile, the
French, who were not pleased with the fighting, continued to trade with
both sides. Jesuit missionaries arrived at Port Royal in 1610 and
immediately began work with the Micmac in the vicinity. Despite the war,
the French priests also built a mission and trading post for the Penobscot
at St Sauver Mont-Deserts de Pentagoet (Bar Harbor, Maine) in 1613. It
had, however, a brief existence and was destroyed, not by natives, but
English raiders from Jamestown, Virginia later that year. In 1615 the
Micmac succeeded in capturing and killing Bashaba and won the war. During
the following two years, victorious Micmac warriors swept down the Maine
coast in a wave of destruction which reached south into Massachusetts.
Here they encountered a different enemy ...epidemic! It followed them
home, and between 1616 and 1619, three separate epidemics swept New
England and the Canadian Maritimes which probably killed at least 75% of
the population. Too few survived to bury the dead, much less wage war, and
the fighting stopped.<p>

The Abenaki had already paid a terrible price for European contact, but
the French had discovered a much better source of fur in the St. Lawrence
Valley. Since Maine and the Canadian Maritimes were exposed to English
raids, they had little reason to stay and began to abandon most of their
posts in 1610. By 1616 only Port Royal and a small trading post at the
mouth of Penobscot River were all that remained to trade with the Abenaki
and Micmac. Even this limited presence was disputed by Great Britain which
claimed the region by virtue of Cabot's voyage (1497) and Sir Humphrey
Gilbert &quot;discoveries&quot; (1578). The first Abenaki experience with English
settlement occurred during an abortive attempt by the Plymouth Company to
establish a colony on the Kennebec River in 1607. Seven years later
Captain James Smith met Abenaki when he explored and mapped the coast of
northern New England. By 1620 the Abenaki were familiar enough with the
English that Samoset, a Pemaquid sachem from Maine hunting in
Massachusetts, could walk into the Plymouth colony in February, 1621 and
greet them in perfect English with &quot;Hello Englishmen.&quot;<p>

During the next 50 years, as the Abenaki probably watched in amazement,
English and French fought several wars over who owned the Abenaki
homeland. In 1628 an English fleet commanded by Thomas Kirke destroyed a
French fleet unloading supplies at Port Royal, burned the French
settlement, and then moved north to the St. Lawrence and captured Quebec.
Britain held all of Canada for four years, until it was returned to France
in 1632 by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye. Meanwhile, Boston fur
traders had established a post near Machias in northern Maine to trade
with the Abenaki. Immediately after they had regained Canada in 1632, the
French destroyed it and warned English traders henceforth to confine their
activities to south of the Kennebec River. In response, the English
ordered French traders from Acadia to remain north of the St. Croix. As a
result, relatively few English and French fur traders were willing to
visit the Abenaki who lived in between.<p>

Despite Samoset's kindness to Plymouth in 1621, relations between the
Abenaki and the English colonists were strained from the beginning. Living
along the Merrimack River of southern New Hampshire and northeastern
Massachusetts, the Pennacook were the southernmost Abenaki group and the
first to have extensive contact with the English. Decimated by the recent
epidemics, they were also threatened from the west by the Mohawk and
distrusted the intentions of the Abenaki in Maine. The Pennacook extended
well-inland along the Merrimack River to a point where their boundaries
with the Sokoki (western Abenaki) blurred. The Sokoki and Pocumtuc
(Connecticut River in western Massachusetts) had a long history of
hostility with the Iroquois and helped the Mahican in their war against
the Mohawk (1624-28) with the Pennacook being drawn in as allies of the
Sokoki. The Mohawk eventually won, forced the Mahican east of the Hudson,
and began to attack the Sokoki and Pennacook. For this reason, the
Pennacook welcomed and made an alliance with the English settlements in
Massachusetts. The alliance between the Pennacook and English made the
Abenaki uneasy, but the colonists were also concerned about their own
safety after the near destruction of Jamestown (Virginia) by the Powhatan
in 1622.<p>

Although they had been by-passed by the fur trade, the Abenaki were still
subject to its destabilizing effects. After finishing with the Mahican in
1628, the Mohawk attacked the Sokoki a year later. The Sokoki and
Pennacook turned to both the French and English for help but were ignored,
since neither wished to offend the powerful Iroquois (Dutch ally). The
Sokoki might well have been destroyed if the Mohawk had not been drawn
into a war in the St. Lawrence Valley with the Algonkin and Montagnais
(French allies) and made peace with the Sokoki and Mahican. Smallpox
epidemic hit the New England tribes during 1633-34 and then spread north
to the Abenaki, the St. Lawrence River, and then west to the Iroquois. By
1637 the Abenaki had their first firearms - probably from Boston traders -
and the following year an English trading post was established on the
Merrimack River among the Pennacook. Despite this, most Abenaki still had
to travel great distances to trade with the Europeans.<p>

Britain and France built few permanent posts in the disputed region of
Maine, and to the west, English and French traders were reluctant to visit
the Sokoki villages because of Mohawk war parties. The English generally
distrusted the Abenaki because of their past association with the French,
not realizing the French were not really interested in the Abenaki because
they were getting all the fur they needed from the Great Lakes through the
<!-- Link Tag --><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411025556/http://www.dickshovel.com/hur.html">Huron</a>. To trade with the French in Quebec, the Abenaki had to cross an
area controlled by the Montagnais who were often hostile or charged tolls
for passage. There was a mixed reaction by different Abenaki tribes to
this trade barrier. Most of the eastern Abenaki eventually came to terms
with the Montagnais, but by 1642 the Sokoki had joined an alliance with
the Mohawk and Mahican against the Montagnais - an uneasy combination of
former enemies against a common foe. The fighting continued for several
years and included a raid by a joint Mohawk, Mahican, and Sokoki war party
on a Montagnais village at Sillery (Quebec) in 1645.<p>

Oddly enough, the Sokoki war with the Montagnais actually renewed French
interest in the Abenaki. After French Jesuits obtained the release of a
Sokoki prisoner held by the Montagnais, they decided to visit the Abenaki.
Opposition by their Montagnais converts (not to mention the chance of
meeting a Mohawk war party) kept the missionaries from the Sokoki
villages, but they made several brief visits to the Kennebec and Penobscot
between 1646 and 1648. The Jesuits were generally well-received by the
eastern Abenaki and were able to arrange a peace between them and the
Montagnais. However, the Sokoki and Montagnais remained hostile to each
other until 1650. Unfortunately, the effect was to continue one war while
creating another. After the eastern Abenaki began to help the Montagnais
against the Iroquois, the Pigwacket and Ossipee on upper Saco River were
attacked by the Mohawk in 1647.<p>

Everything changed after the Iroquois overran the Huron during the winter
of 1648-49. The destruction of their most important ally and trading
partner put the survival of the French themselves in doubt, and they began
gathering every possible ally against the Iroquois. The uneasy alliance of
the Mohawk and Sokoki also collapsed, and the Mohawk began attacking the
Sokoki and Pocumtuc in 1650. The French encouraged an alliance between the
Sokoki, Pocumtuc, Pennacook, and Mahican and even sent a Montagnais chief
and Jesuit to Massachusetts to ask for support in a war against the
Mohawk. While the New England Puritans recognized the threat, the devil
himself would have had a better chance of forming an alliance with them
than a French Jesuit, and the offer was refused. This left only the French
to support the alliance and by 1651, they were supplying the Sokoki,
eastern Abenaki, and their allies with firearms and ammunition.<p>

The alliance failed to stop the Iroquois and may even have provoked them.
In 1653 the western Sokoki villages were attacked, but the Mohawk had
another war with the <!-- Link Tag --><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411025556/http://www.dickshovel.com/susque.html">Susquehannock</a> in Pennsylvania and could not maintain
two offensives. After a Dutch attempt to arrange peace failed in 1654,
there was a lull in the fighting in western New England until after the
Mohawk ended their war with the Susquehannock in 1655. They turned east
with a fury forcing the Mahican to make a separate peace and withdraw from
the alliance in 1658. This left only the Sokoki, Pennacook, and Pocumtuc
to face the Mohawk - something that might have been possible except for
the English. Britain captured Port Royal for a second time in 1654 and
held it until 1667. This stopped aid for the Abenaki from the French in
Acadia. At first Boston traders supplied the Abenaki and made good profits
in the process. However, this ended after the English captured New York
from the Dutch in 1664 and signed a treaty of trade and alliance with the
Mohawk. Most of the Boston traders moved west to Albany and abandoned the
Abenaki.<p>

Meanwhile, the Mohawk by 1660 had resumed attacks on the eastern Abenaki in Maine because they were allies of the Montagnais. Two years later the Penobscot were hit for the same reason. Only the Quebec French continued to support the Abenaki. The French trader Baron de Castine settled among the Penobscot and married the daughter of their sachem, Madockawando. After Madockawando's death, Castine assumed the sachemship, until his son (Castine the Younger) became old enough to assume the responsibility. A permanent trading post and Jesuit mission (Castine, Maine) were added at this time. Castine and his son were implacable foes of the British, and under their leadership, the Penobscot grew increasingly hostile contributing to the English decision to abandon the Abenaki. Although the French supplied guns and ammunition, it was not enough. After a Pocumtuc attack on the eastern Mohawk villages failed in 1663, they asked the Dutch and Mahican to negotiate a peace. This came to nothing. Although a Mohawk-Seneca attack on their main village at Fort Hill (Deerfield, Massachusetts) in December, 1664 was repulsed, by the following spring, the Pocumtuc had abandoned the Connecticut Valley in Massachusetts leaving Missisquoi and Cowasuck as the only remaining large Sokoki villages in Vermont.<p>

Throughout 1665 the Mohawk continued the war against the Pocumtuc's Sokoki
and Pennacook allies. The fighting was interrupted when the French brought
the 1,200 man Carigan-Salieres regiment to Canada, and French soldiers
attacked the Mohawk villages during the winter of 1665-66. By the
following spring the Mohawk were asking the English for help. The governor
of New York (also concerned about French intentions) agreed but only on
condition the Mohawk make peace with Mahican and Sokoki. The Mahican, who
had been fighting the Iroquois since 1662, were willing, but the Sokoki
refused to quit. During the summer of 1666, there was an exchange of raids
with the Mohawk raiding the Pennacook while the Sokoki and Kennebec
attacked Mohawk villages.<p>

The Iroquois were able to arrange a general peace with the French in 1667
which allowed the western Iroquois to concentrate on the Susquehannock
while the Mohawk went after western New England. During 1668 the Mohawk
were able to drive the Pennacook across New Hampshire into southern Maine.
The following year an alliance of New England Algonquin (including Sokoki
and Mahican) retaliated with an attack on a Mohawk village but were
ambushed on their return home. By 1670 most of the Sokoni were living
under French protection as refugees along the St. Lawrence. Some
eventually migrated west to the Great Lakes, and in 1681 a group of Sokoki
accompanied LaSalle during his exploration of the south end of Lake
Michigan. Afterwards, they chose to remain in northern Illinois and were
later absorbed by the Potawatomi and Miami.<p>

For the most part, the Abenaki had remained neutral in the struggles
between Britain and France, but the alliance between the English and
Iroquois pushed them to the French. On the eve of the King Philip's War
(1675-76), the Abenaki not only resented English support of the Iroquois
but were increasingly concerned about the appetite of the New England
colonists for land. Massive Puritan immigration during the 1660s launched
a rapid expansion of white settlement into native territory, and the first
areas taken were the valuable farmlands in the river valleys. Trapped
between the Mohawk in the west and growing English settlement from the
east, the Algonquin of southern New England joined together under the
leadership of Metacom (King Philip) in a general attack against the New
England colonies in 1675. Although many sympathized with Philip, the
Androscoggin (also some Sokoni and Pennacook) were the only Abenaki at
first to participate directly in the uprising. The majority of the Abenaki
were neutral, but it appears some provided French firearms and ammunition
to Philip's warriors, while others gave food and refuge to the hostiles.<p>

The colonists lost heavily in the struggle, and in their desperation, they
retaliated with an indiscriminate fury against all Indians. Only two
Pennacook villages joined Philip - the Pennacook sachem Wannalancet was
able to keep most of his people out of the fighting. However, the English
became convinced the Pennacook were giving aid and comfort, and a
expedition commanded by Captain Samuel Mosely attacked them in 1676. After
200 Nashua were massacred and the survivors sold into slavery, most
Pennacook either fought or left for Canada. By 1676 even the Penobscot and
Kennebec had been drawn into the war. In the end the colonists won, but
even by their own accounts, they were brutal. Thousands had been massacred
or starved. After 1676 only 4,000 Native Americans remained in southern
New England. In what has been called the &quot;Great Dispersal,&quot; the survivors
had been forced to leave their homeland, but they did not go far. Some
accepted a sanctuary offered by the governor of New York (Edmund Andros)
and settled among the Mahican at Schaghticook on the Hudson. Others found
refuge with the Delaware in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but large numbers
of refugees - angry from their mistreatment by the New England colonists -
joined the Abenaki.<p>

The English had also suffered (at least 600 killed and 13 towns burned),
but it is pretty obvious they had given much better than they had
received, and their hatred is reflected in the harsh peace terms they
imposed on the survivors. By most accounts, the King Philip's War ended
with Philip's death in 1676. In reality it was just beginning and would
continue for 50 years. During the war, several English expeditions sent
against the Abenaki and Pennacook only succeeded in capturing empty
villages. It was the first experience of the English with an enemy that
would vanish only to attack later. Abenaki retreated to Canada and settled
near Sillery (Quebec). They did not return to Maine for several years
until after the fighting had subsided. The Sokoki continued to raid
Massachusetts, but the governor of New York set the Mohawk on them forcing
them to relocate to Trois-Rivieres, and St. Francois River for French
protection.<p>

New England was perfectly content to see the Abenaki leave, but New York's
Governor Andros was concerned about the defection of so many possible new
allies for the French. Although it made him a hated man in New England,
his offer of asylum at Schaghticook to refugees was intended to prevent
this. The offer met with some success, but over the years there was a
steady exodus of New England Algonquin from Schaghticook to join their
relatives and the Abenaki in the north. Meanwhile, the Abenaki continued
to punish New England with long-distance raids from Canada. While the
English could not retaliate, the situation was not ideal. Thousands of
Abenaki along the St. Lawrence quickly strained the available resources
and caused friction with the resident Montagnais. By 1679 the Abenaki were
ready to go home. The Pigwacket were the first to make peace with the
English and return to Maine. Other Abenaki and Sokoki gradually followed.<p>

However, important changes had occurred during their stay in Canada. The
Abenaki had organized into a loose confederation allied with the French.
The role of the French in the subsequent warfare between the Abenaki and
New England has often been exaggerated, because the New England colonists
never understood the underlying reasons for Abenaki hostility. The Abenaki
were never interested in helping the French control North America.
Actually, the Abenaki did not always get along with the French - at the
beginning of the King William's War in 1688, as the French demanded they
remain near Montreal, the Sokoki decided instead to move south and burned
several French settlements enroute. For the most part, the Abenaki had
their own war with New England to avenge past injustices and to keep the
English from taking their land. The New England colonists, however, saw
themselves as victims of an unprovoked attack during the King Philip's
War, generally refused to recognize any aboriginal title to the land, and
viewed the continued raids by the Abenaki as French aggression.<p>

Since the French needed the Abenaki as a buffer to protect Quebec against
the English, they provided weapons and encouraged hostility towards New
England. A final ugly element had been added when French Jesuits began
making conversions among the Abenaki while they were refugees in Canada.
After the Abenaki had returned to their homeland, the Jesuits had followed
them, and by 1699 there were at least six Jesuits permanently living in
the Abenaki villages. In the closing years of the 17th century, the
Jesuits had been increasingly alarmed that the fur trade was corrupting
and destroying Native Americans. Since this placed them at odds with more
practical economic concerns, their complaints were generally ignored by
the French government - that is until a glut of fur on the European market
caused the price to drop. With the support of French court, the fur trade
was restricted, and Jesuits afterwards were able to work first for
conversion and then tried to isolate their converts from further contact
with Europeans.<p>

If the Jesuits were reluctant to allow French Catholics to visit their
Abenaki converts, there should be little doubt as to their attitude about
contact (or trade) with the English &quot;heretics.&quot; The Jesuit policy was
particularly effective among the Abenaki and should have served to
isolate and protect them. Instead, it roused the darkest fears of the New
England's Puritans who usually saw the manipulative hand of Catholic
France being directed against their Protestant colonies. The main reason
for continued hostilities between the Abenaki and New England was not a
French or Catholic plot, but Massachusetts' inability (or unwillingness)
to prevent encroachment and abuse by its citizens on the frontier.
Fighting with the Abenaki dragged on until a truce in 1685, a brief
three-year break that erupted into open warfare with the King William's
War between Britain and France (1688-97). Afterwards, the struggle between
the Abenaki and New England began to reflect the bitter religious
divisions of 17th century Europe.<p>		

The reasons for this are rather complicated. The few and gentle Pilgrims  
who landed at Plymouth in 1620 were absorbed by the numerous Puritans of
the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the 1630s. There was an enormous
difference between these two groups. Beginning as a movement to purify the
English church of its Catholic traditions, the Puritans overthrew and
executed Charles I in 1649 and established a military dictatorship under
Olive Cromwell. After Cromwell's death in 1658 and the restoration of the
English monarchy two years later, the Puritans were, to put it mildly, in
political disfavor, and many of them found it prudent to immigrate to New
England. By appointing Sir Edmund Andros governor of New York in 1674,
Charles II attempted to re-assert his authority over the people
responsible for the death of his brother, Charles I. Colonial charters
were revoked, and the Dominion of New England was established in 1686 with
Andros as governor. This lasted only until the Glorious Revolution (1688)
removed the Stuarts from the throne.<p>

A major reason for the fall of the Stuarts was a growing belief that they
were on the verge of restoring the Catholic church. To this end Jesuits
had been secretly entering England on the behalf of the Vatican for years.
Aware of this intrigue, New England Puritans could hardly fail to notice
members of this same religious order were living among the Abenaki on
their northern frontier. The militant attitude of the Abenaki after they
returned from Canada only seemed to confirm their suspicion of a plot
which could even involve elements in the English government, and Andros'
offer of a New York sanctuary for Algonquin refugees from New England in
1676 had only added fuel to the fire. The Sokoki were already French
allies against the Iroquois having joined them in attacks on the Seneca
villages in 1684. With the outbreak of war between Britain and France
in 1688, the Abenaki needed little encouragement to launch themselves
against the New England frontier.<p>

With the onset of fighting the Abenaki withdrew to sanctuaries in northern
New England and Canada. Raids struck throughout New England with a
ferocity unseen since the King Philip's War and by 1695 had forced the
abandonment of most of the New England frontier. The Penobscot destroyed
York, Maine in 1691 and massacred 77 of its inhabitants, but by 1693 they
had tired of the fighting. Together with the Kennebec, Androscoggin, and
Saco, they made peace with the English, but the Sokoki near St. Francois
(Odanak) had been raided several times by the Mohawk (English allies).
They remained active in the war and participated in the French attacks on
the Mohawk villages in 1693 and the Onondaga three-years later. The Sokoki
also continued their raids into New England, one of which even reached the
vicinity of Boston during 1697. The Treaty of Ryswick (1697) ended the war
between Britain and France, but the fighting between the Abenaki and New
England persisted for two years. At a treaty signed in 1699, the eastern
Abenaki promised to remain neutral in future wars between Britain and
France.<p>

The future was only two years away. War between Britain and France resumed
with the Queen Anne's War (1701-13). True to their obligations, most
eastern Abenaki remained neutral and withdrew to Wolinak (Becancour) near
Trois-Rivieres, Quebec. Others established villages with the Sokoki near
the new Jesuit mission at St. Francois du Lac. New England colonists were
so reluctant to enter Abenaki territory in Maine, it took them almost two
years to realize the Abenaki had left. Western New England was different.
By 1700 the Sokoki had formed a lasting alliance with the Caughnawaga
(Christian Mohawk who had relocated to Canada and become French allies)
and did not remain neutral. The new alliance also served to protect the
Sokoki from the British-allied Mohawk, who, in honoring the Iroquois
&quot;Great Law of Peace,&quot; avoided combat with their Caughnawaga relatives who
were allies of the French. The arrangement even extended to the Albany
traders of New York who continued to trade with the Sokoki throughout the
war.<p>

New England, however, had no peace with the Abenaki. Forming joint war
parties with the Caughnawaga, the Sokoki raided the frontier from their
village of Missisquoi on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, Cowasuck in
northern Vermont, and St. Francois in Quebec. The mixed populations of
these villages made the affiliations of the raiders impossible, and they
became known in New England as St. Francis, or simply Abenaki. The most
famous raid occurred at Deerfield, Massachusetts on the unlikely date of
February 29, 1704 and resulted in 56 dead, 109 captured, and half the
houses burned. Massachusetts militia attacked Cowasuck in retaliation, but
most of the Sokoki escaped and retreated north beyond reach. The English
had little success in stopping the raids. Haverhill, Massachusetts was
destroyed in 1708, and Deerfield repulsed another raid in 1709. Military
expeditions against the Ossipee and into the upper Connecticut Valley
achieved little. Meanwhile, Haverhill (only 30 miles north of Boston) was
attacked in 1713.<p>

However, in Maine, the departure of the Abenaki had opened the door for
British attacks against the French in Acadia. The initial British attack
in 1701 on a French fort on the Penobscot failed, but three years later
the British succeeded and gained control of the entire coast of Maine.
Military expeditions against the Pigwacket in 1704 and 1708 succeeded only
in capturing empty villages but demonstrated that the Abenaki had
withdrawn into Canada. Two British attempts to take Port Royal in 1707
failed, but the final effort in 1710 succeeded and forced the French to
halt raids on New England to defend Quebec against a possible British
naval attack. While the Sokoki remained near St. Francois and Missisquoi,
the eastern Abenaki began returning to Maine in 1709. The British capture
of Arcadia in 1710 more-or-less ended the war in North America. Three
years later at Treaty of Utrecht (1713), France ceded Acadia (Nova Scotia)
to Great Britain. For the first time, the entire Abenaki homeland in Maine
was clearly under British rule. Although the eastern Abenaki were very
upset with this situation, they agreed to peace with Massachusetts at
Portsmouth that year. West of White Mountains, the Sokoki lands in
northern Vermont and New Hampshire, however, remained a disputed area
between the Britain and France.<p>

The French in Acadia (renamed Nova Scotia by the British) did not accept
the Treaty of Utrecht as permanent and expected the next conflict would
return control to France. That is, if British settlement did not overrun
the area in the meantime. By 1717 new English settlements were moving
rapidly up the coast of Maine and into the Connecticut Valley of southern
Vermont and New Hampshire. Feeling they were defending the rights of their
Abenaki converts (and perhaps those of France as well), several Jesuits,
most notably Father Sebastian Rasles, strongly encouraged the Abenaki to
defend both their lands and themselves. Conferences in 1717 and 1719
between the English and Abenaki could not reach an agreement, and after
several incidents of violence, Massachusetts governor Samuel Shuttle
declared war on the Abenaki in 1722. Known as Dummer's War (Grey Lock's
War, Lovewell's Wa, or Father Rasles' War), the fighting lasted five years
until 1727. In 1724 a colonial army attacked and burned Norridgewock on
the upper Kennebec River in Maine, killing Rasles and mutilating his
corpse. Although the French were never involved directly in the war, their
sympathies were definitely with the Abenaki, and their reaction to the
circumstances of Rasles' death almost provoked an open rebellion among the
French population in Acadia.<p>

Only 150 Kennebec refugees from Norridgewock managed to reach safety in
Canada. After the Pigwacket were defeated the following spring, resistance
by the Abenaki in Maine ended. In December they signed a peace treaty with
Massachusetts which was ratified at Falmouth the following August. The
fighting continued in the west, however, for another two years in what
could be considered a separate, but related, conflict - Grey Lock's War
(1723-27). A member of the Pocumtuc who had found refuge in New York after
the King Philip's War, Grey Lock (Wawanotewat &quot;he who fools others&quot;) had
left Schaghticook and joined the Sokoki at Missisquoi. After war with New
England began in 1722, he became a war leader and his successful raids
against settlements in the Connecticut valley of Massachusetts earned him
a large following. Unable to capture Grey Lock or locate his secret
&quot;castle&quot; near Missisquoi, the English asked the Iroquois to help, but they
refused to become involved except as possible mediators.<p>

After the war in Maine ended in 1726 with the defeat of the eastern
Abenaki and a peace treaty, Massachusetts sent gifts and an offer of peace
to Grey Lock in the fall. No answer came back except in the form of
continued raids. New York, the Iroquois, and the Penobscot made other
attempts to mediate an end to the conflict, but Grey Lock also ignored
these efforts. The Penobscot, however, did succeed in getting the Canadian
Abenaki at Wolinak and St. Francois to agree to peace with New England.
Grey Lock was noticeably absent from the treaty signed at Montreal in July
of 1727, but shortly afterwards - probably honoring the request of the
Abenaki at St. Francois - he ended the war but never signed any agreement
with the English. Seventeen years of peace followed what had been 50 of
continuous war between the Abenaki and New England.<p>

The Pigwacket, Androscoggin, Norridgewock returned to Maine during 1727,
and in the years following, the Penobscot emerged as the spokesman for the
eastern Abenaki with the French and English. For the most part, these
peoples would never leave their homeland again. The Passamaquoddy and
Maliseet continued to occupy the St. Croix and St. John Rivers
respectively, while in Nova Scotia (Acadia) the French Acadians and Micmac
patiently awaited their return to France rule and maintained an uneasy
truce with the British garrisons in the area. Two permanent Abenaki
communities had meanwhile emerged in Quebec: Becancour (near
Trois-Rivieres composed mostly of eastern Abenaki displaced from southern
Maine); and St. Francois (30 miles to the southwest with a mixed
population of Sokoki, Pennacook, and New England Algonquin). The Sokoki
also maintained a large, permanent village at Missisquoi on Lake Champlain
and a smaller settlement at Cowasuck in northern Vermont.<p>

After Dummer's War, New England came to think of the Abenaki as having
permanently migrated to Canada - an error which has persisted to the
present. For this reason, virtually all groups of Sokoki and Abenaki
encountered in northern New England during this period were usually
referred to as St. Francis Indians. The poorly defined boundary between
Quebec and New England (a question not completely settled until the 1800s)
contributed to the confusion, but it also was a convenient excuse for
taking what was considered the unoccupied land in between. In truth the
Sokoki and Abenaki never really left northern New England and bands of
extended families have continued to live and hunt there ever since. After
1727 English settlements cautiously crept north along the Connecticut
River into southern Vermont and New Hampshire, but the slow advance of
these heavily fortified outposts in a time of peace is a clear indication
that the Sokoki and Abenaki were still present in northern New England in
large enough numbers to seriously dispute this encroachment.<p>

A major smallpox epidemic forced the abandonment of Missisquoi in 1730,
but it was re-occupied the following year. In one of those questionable
agreements by natives of doubtful authority, some Sokoki and Schaghticook
were induced to sell land along the Connecticut and Deerfield Rivers in
1735. Despite this agreement, the Sokoki continued to protest each new
English settlement and made it very clear that they considered the upper
Connecticut Valley as their own. Their numbers had been reduced by war,
epidemic, and slow exodus west to the Great Lakes (only 150 warriors), but
allied with the French and Caughnawaga, they were still formidable. The
friction increased, but the Sokoki still traded with both the English and
French. The real problem, however, was to the west at the disputed
boundary between Canada and New York in the upper Hudson Valley. French
settlement on Lake Champlain had begun near Missisquoi in 1734, and a
Jesuit mission was added in 1743.<p>

With the beginning of the King George's War (1744-48) between Britain and
France, the long period of peace ended. Both the Abenaki and Sokoki stood
with the French. The Cowasuck and Eastern Abenaki withdrew north towards
Canada, but strangely enough, a few St. Francois and Pigwacket (one of the
last mentions of the Pigwacket who disappear from record after 1750)
sought refuge near Boston with the English. The Sokoki and their
Caughnawaga allies promptly cleaned out most of the new settlements in
southern Vermont and New Hampshire and harassed the few that remained for
the next four years. Governor Shirley of Massachusetts in 1744 declared
war on Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, and St. John Indians (actually the
Maliseet and Micmac) so the Canadian Maritimes were aflame ...at least for
the English since the French Acadians were officially neutral and openly
sympathized with the Micmac. At least 35 Abenaki and Sokoki war parties
attacked the frontier during the spring of 1746. In August Fort
Massachusetts on Hoosac River was captured and almost all of the
settlements on the east side of the Hudson River in New York had to be
abandoned.<p>

Only Mohawk sided with the British, but after their raid just south of Montreal, the Canadian Iroquois declared war on the British colonies in 1747. The French-British war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, but the Penobscot, Kennebec, Maliseet and Passamaquoddy did not sign a separate peace until 1749. It took even longer for Penobscot to get the St. Francois to agree to call in their war parties. Although they had been battered on the frontiers by the native allies of the French, the British had succeeded in capturing the French fortress at Louisbourg in 1745. Much to the outrage of New England the peace treaty had returned Louisbourg to France, and much to the outrage of the French Acadians, Britain had retained control of the Canadian Maritimes. If there was one thing the King George's War accomplished, it was to leave all parties dissatisfied and ready for another war to settle things.<p>

In 1749 the French reoccupied the upper St. John's River. By blaming the
British for a smallpox epidemic that had broken out among the Micmac
during the war and supplying arms and ammunition, they were able to
prolong the fighting in Nova Scotia until 1752. By 1755 the British had
decided to regain control of the Maritimes by deporting the entire French
Acadian population which had steadfastly refused to sign an oath of
loyalty to Great Britain. Things were also very tense in western New
England, and the Sokoki at St. Francois threatened war in 1752 if there
was any further English settlement up the Connecticut River. The murder of
two of Abenaki hunters by New Englanders the following year brought
retaliatory raids against the New England frontier during the summer of
1754. Preparing for war, the French had encouraged the mission villages
along the St. Lawrence (Caughnawaga, Lake of the Two Mountains, St.
Francois, Becancour, Oswegatchie, Lorette, and St. Regis) to organize
themselves as the Seven Nations of Canada (Great Fire of Caughnawaga).<p>

The Caughnawaga dominated this group and attended the Albany Conference
with the British colonies (August, 1754). Speaking on behalf of the
Abenaki and Sokoki, the Caughnawaga agreed to stay out of any future war
between Britain and France. Unfortunately, it was a promise that could not
be kept. The opening shots of the French and Indian War (1755-63) were
actually fired in 1754 in western Pennsylvania. Raids from Missisquoi
and St. Francois hit the frontier in New York that year, and the Penobscot
attacked Maine settlements, prompting the Massachusetts governor to offer
bounties of: &#163;50 male Penobscot prisoner, &#163;40 male scalp, &#163;25 woman/child
prisoner, and &#163;20 woman/child scalp. In 1755 the British had assembled a
large military expedition under General Edmund Braddock to capture Fort
Duquesne (Pittsburgh). Strangely enough, the allies that helped the French
inflict the horrendous defeat on Braddock's army near Pittsburgh were, for
the most part, not from the Ohio valley, but warriors from the Seven
Nations of Canada led by a Huron war chief from Lorette.<p>

Abenaki and Sokoki warriors also participated in Montcalm's campaign in
northern New York, where it is rumored that the Penobscot initiated the
massacre that followed the capture of Fort William Henry in 1757.
Meanwhile, an Abenaki war party from Becancour raiding near Albany
gathered up the last 60 New England Algonquin at Schaghticook and took
them back to St. Francois in Canada. Except on the frontier in Vermont,
Maine, and New Hampshire, New England suffered relatively few Indian
attacks during the war, especially after the colonial rangers commanded by
Major Robert Rogers attacked and burned St. Francois during the fall of
1759. Rogers claimed to have killed 200 Abenaki (including the French
priest), but the French records listed only 30 dead. Charlestown was
raided in retaliation, but the St. Francois dispersed after the raid and
were effectively taken out of the war. After the capture of Quebec in
1759, the war was over in North America, although the French did not
officially leave until 1763.<p>

Peace did not come uniformly, and Rogers Rangers were required to expel
the French from the St. John's River in 1760. Even then a British survey
crew was warned by the Maliseet to remain on the lower part of the river.
Peace with the St. John's tribes and their eastern Abenaki allies did not
really happen until after treaties were signed in 1770 and 1776, and peace
with the Micmac took another three years. Elsewhere, with the French
defeated and the Abenaki scattered into small groups, settlers flooded
north between 1761 and 1774. With their lands being overrun, the Seven
Nations considered joining the Pontiac Rebellion in 1763, but in the end
urged peace. The British response to the uprising was to issue the
Proclamation of 1763 halting further settlement west of the Appalachian
crest. However, Sir William Johnson, the British Indian agent for North
America, ruled that this did not cover lands claimed by the Caughnawaga,
Sokoki, and Abenaki.<p>

This left the Abenaki without a homeland. After years of passing
back-and-forth across the border, Quebec considered them New England
Indians, and New England felt they belonged in Canada. During the war,
many Abenaki and Sokoki had been given refuge at the St. Regis, but with
the end of the fighting, the Mohawk wanted them to leave, but they no
longer had a place to go. Some stayed as unwelcome guests, others were
absorbed by St. Francois, but many were forced to scatter in small bands
across northern New England as squatters in their own homeland. It was not
surprising that, on the eve of the American Revolution in 1775, the
Abenaki and many former French allies longed for the return of French rule
to North America. The American Revolution presented the Abenaki with two
poor choices between the Americans who were taking their land and the
British who were giving it away.<p>

In the beginning, the Seven Nations and other Abenaki were asked to remain neutral but ended up fighting on both sides. Already involved in a struggle with the British over settlement in northern Maine and the Canadian Maritimes, and perhaps hoping the revolution would get rid of the British and restore the French in Canada, the Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Maliseet and Micmac sided with the Americans. The St. Francois were divided but some helped the Americans besiege Boston and provided guides for Benedict Arnold's ill-fated expedition against Quebec during the winter of 1776-77. The Penobscot also served as scouts for Washington's army, and in 1779 participated in the unsuccessful American attack against the British forts on the Penobscot River. Colonel John Allen formed an Abenaki regiment at Machias which harassed British shipping along the Maine coast during the war. Meanwhile, other Abenaki served with the British and raided Maine's Androscoggin valley in 1781.<p>

After the war the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy received some recognition for their services and by 1798 Massachusetts established three small reservations for them in northern Maine (Maine was not a state until 1820). The treaty was a clear violation of the Non-Intercourse Act passed by Congress in 1790, and led to a $81.5 million federal settlement in 1978 for lands taken from them without compensation. Federal recognition followed in 1980. The Passamaquoddy and Penobscot were granted representation in the Maine legislature in 1823, but their representatives had no status except in matters concerning Native Americans. Tribal members were not allowed to vote in state elections until 1924. The Canadian Abenaki at St. Francois and B&#233;cancour were granted reserves. These were enlarged to accommodate an enlarged population in 1805, although the land was reclaimed in 1839 for &quot;non-use.&quot; During the War of 1812, the &quot;last time the Abenaki went to war,&quot; B&#233;cancour provided two companies to the British army. The St. Francois and B&#233;cancour have endured to the present, although groups have left over the years. Many went west and worked with the Hudson Bay Company during the 1800s.<p> 

Small groups of Abenaki have been moving west to the Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley since they accompanied La Salle's expedition in 1680. The French
encouraged one group to move to Ohio in 1721, but upon learning the
Abenaki had proposed an alliance with the Fox (who were at war with the
French at the time), the invitation was withdrawn. Several small groups
still managed to settle along the Ohio River by the 1750. In 1787 some of
the Abenaki with the Iroquois at St. Regis left. Crossing the Mississippi,
they settled on the White River in Spanish Arkansas. After the Louisiana
Purchase in 1803, they apparently merged with the Delaware and Shawnee who
lived nearby and later moved with them, first to Kansas and then Oklahoma.
Vermont became a state in 1791, but neither it nor the United States has
ever recognized the land claims or tribal status of the Abenaki living
there. The Sokoki presented claims for parts of their homeland in 1798,
1800, 1812, 1826, 1853, and 1874, but all were rejected by the State of
Vermont.

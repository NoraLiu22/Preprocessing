        Meeting Day, the first Tuesday in March, citizens across Vermont come 
        together in their communities to discuss the business of their towns.&nbsp; 
        For over 200 years Town Meeting Day has been an important political 
        event as Vermonters elect local officers and vote on budgets.&nbsp; It 
        has also been a time for neighbors to discuss the civic issues of their 
        community, state, and nation.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">This short 
        publication is designed to help you learn about Vermont�s Town Meeting 
        Day, its history and how it works today. We also hope that the materials 
        in this booklet will help you get involved in your town meeting. </span>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">The Origin 
        of Town Meeting Day</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">The first town 
        meeting in America was in Massachusetts in 1633, but the practice of 
        direct democracy dates back to around 400 B.C. in Athens of ancient 
        Greece. Unlike town meetings today, in ancient Greece women, children 
        and slaves could not vote, and meetings required the presence of at 
        least 6,000 citizens!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Vermont town 
        meeting is a tradition dating back to before there was a Vermont. The 
        first town meeting was held in Bennington in 1762, 15 years before 
        Vermont was created.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">In the late 
        1700s, as today, town citizens in Vermont held meetings so that they 
        could address the problems and issues they faced collectively. Popular 
        matters of legislation in earlier town meetings included whether or not 
        to let pigs run free or whether smallpox vaccinations should be allowed 
        in the town (some thought vaccinations were dangerous). Voters also 
        decided what goods or labor could be used as payment for taxes.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Town meeting 
        also served a social function (as it does today.) It brings people 
        together who might not otherwise know each other.&nbsp; This can strengthen 
        social ties within a town and help people work together to tackle 
        community problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">What is Town 
        Meeting Day?</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">On the first 
        Tuesday of March most Vermont towns hold a meeting to elect local 
        officials, approve a budget for the following year, and conduct other 
        local business. Vermont town meetings (with one exception) are the 
        practice of direct democracy. That is, eligible citizens of the town may 
        vote on specific issues that are announced through a warning.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">&nbsp;</span>T<span style="layout-grid-mode: line">he 
        town meeting <b>w</b>arning<b> </b>tells us when and where town meeting 
        will be held, and it lists all of the articles<b> </b>(topics) that are 
        going to be discussed and voted on at the meeting. The warning must be 
        posted at least 30 days before the meeting.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 16.0pt">Voting At Town 
        Meeting</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Towns can vote 
        in two different ways at March Town Meeting � by �floor meeting� or by 
        �Australian Ballot.�&nbsp; Most towns use a combination of both voting 
        methods.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">The �floor 
        meeting� is what we generally picture a Vermont Town Meeting to be like 
        � it is when people gather together at a public meeting place like the 
        town hall or local school to discuss and vote on issues.&nbsp; Floor meetings 
        can last a few hours � or they can go all day. &nbsp;The length of the 
        meeting depends on how many articles are on the warning and how much 
        discussion there is over the issues raised by the articles.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">&nbsp;�Australian 
        Ballot� voting takes only a few minutes.&nbsp; It takes place at a polling 
        place where voters mark a secret ballot which is counted when the polls 
        close. This is how we cast our ballots at the general election in 
        November. Town Boards of Civil Authority determine when the polls open 
        in the morning (between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. and all polls must 
        close at 7:00 p.m.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Most towns use 
        a combination of Australian Ballot voting and a floor meeting.&nbsp; In 2008, 
        approximately 15 towns conducted all of the town meeting business using 
        Australian ballot voting, 61 decided all of their business by floor 
        vote and 170 towns used a combination of both.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h5><span style="font-size: 16.0pt">Floor Meeting</span></h5>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">At a floor 
        meeting there are no representatives (except in Brattleboro, which uses 
        a system of representative democracy for its town meeting). Citizens 
        speak directly for themselves, seeking to clarify or amend items to be 
        voted, or to persuade those present on whether or not to vote for a 
        particular measure.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">Town Meeting 
        Holiday</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Vermont law makes town meeting a holiday for 
        employees of state government.&nbsp; The law also gives an employee the 
        right to take unpaid leave from work to attend his or her annual town 
        meeting, subject to the essential operation of the business or 
        government.&nbsp; An employee must give the employer at least seven days 
        notice if he or she wants to take advantage of this right to attend town 
        meeting.&nbsp; Students who are over 18 also have the right to attend 
        town meeting, unless the student is in state custody at a secure 
        facility.&nbsp; These students may not be treated as truants for missing 
        school to attend town meetings.&nbsp; 21 V.S.A.<font face="Times New Roman">�472b.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Many factors 
        can affect turnout at town meeting. For example, in 2001 there was a big 
        blizzard. That year many towns postponed their meetings. Towns that went 
        ahead with their meeting had very few people attending. Also, because 
        many of Vermont�s schools are not in session the week preceding town 
        meeting, voters who are parents of school children may be away on 
        vacation.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">A small percentage <span style="layout-grid-mode: line">
        of Vermont�s towns hold their meeting on Saturday. Many people were 
        surprised to discover that turnout for Town Meeting did not increase 
        with Saturday meetings.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">What Happens on 
        Town Meeting Day?</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Over the past 
        200 years little has changed about what actually happens at town 
        meeting. The meeting begins with each town electing a <b>moderator </b>
        who runs the town meeting. The town clerk keeps minutes of the 
        discussion and records the votes.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Every town 
        begins its meetings in its own way. &nbsp;After the moderator �<b>calls the 
        meeting to order� </b>(by banging the gavel and asking everyone to quiet 
        down so the meeting can start), many towns begin with the Pledge of 
        Allegiance. &nbsp;Some introduce the selectboard or school board, some thank 
        the volunteers who are providing food or displays at the meeting, some 
        welcome and recognize the oldest or newest members of the community, and 
        some simply get down to the business of the day.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">The Moderator</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">The <b>
        moderator�s </b>job is to ensure that the meeting is orderly and fair. 
        He or she calls for votes on each item of business and announces the 
        decisions of the voters. The moderator must also interpret and apply 
        rules governing how the discussion and votes proceed.</span>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">The moderator 
        begins the work of the meeting by announcing the first article listed in 
        the warning. &nbsp;After an article is voted on, the moderator announces the 
        next article listed in the warning. Unless the voters decide to pass 
        over an article or rearrange the order of the articles, the meeting will 
        address each article in turn, from the first to the last, until they are 
        all addressed.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Vermont law 
        requires that the moderator use a very formal procedure to run the 
        meeting called <b>Robert's Rules of Order</b>. Robert's Rules of Order 
        sets specific rules for the meeting to help the moderator keep order and 
        ensure that the meeting is fair. These rules are published in a small 
        book that can be referred to during the meeting if necessary.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">Typical 
        Procedure Using Robert�s Rules of Order</span></b></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">a) The 
        Moderator reads the article: <b>�Shall the Town give $2000 to the ice 
        rink for their youth hockey program?�</b></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">b) A voter 
        raises his or her hand to be <b>recognized </b>(called on). The 
        moderator recognizes the voter and the voter stands up and makes a 
        motion to adopt the article: �<b>I move the article.�</b></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">c) The 
        moderator asks if there is a �second to the motion� (another voter who 
        wants to discuss and vote on the article): �<b>Do we have a second to 
        the motion?�</b></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">d) A second 
        voter �seconds� the motion: <b>�I second the motion.� </b>If there is no 
        second, the article is �passed over� (not discussed or voted on.)</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">e) After the 
        �second�, the moderator asks for any discussion on the motion: <b>�Would 
        anyone like to begin discussion on the motion?�</b></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">f) Voters 
        raise their hands to be recognized by the moderator. When a person is 
        called on, he or she speaks to the moderator. Voters may make statements 
        in support of or against the proposal. This discussion is called <b>
        debating the motion. </b>At any time, a voter can move to close the 
        debate.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">A motion to 
        cut off debate needs a two-thirds majority to pass. The moderator 
        ensures that everyone who wants to speak has a turn before anyone is 
        allowed to speak a second time. This prevents the debate from getting 
        personal, and makes sure everyone has an equal opportunity to 
        participate.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">g) A voter may 
        move to amend the article: <b>�I move to amend the article by reducing 
        the proposed amount to $1500.� </b>An amendment can be rejected by the 
        moderator (ruled �<b>out of order�</b>) if it is not <b>germane </b>
        (relevant) or if it is <b>hostile to </b>(against) the article. For 
        example, an amendment that proposes to take the $2,000 for the ice rink 
        and use it instead for repairs on the town pool would be rejected as 
        hostile. </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Amendments 
        must be germane because voters can only make decisions about topics that 
        were included in the town meeting warning. For that reason amendments 
        cannot propose an action that was not warned.</span>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">h) After an 
        amendment is made, the moderator asks for a second, and if there is one, 
        the moderator will see if people want to discuss the amendment. At the 
        end of discussion there will be a vote, first on the amendment, and 
        then, if discussion is complete, there will be a vote on the original 
        motion, as amended.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">i) Each 
        article on the warning can be amended only twice. The votes go in 
        reverse order.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">j) There are 
        three ways for the town meeting to vote on an article:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
        <span style="layout-grid-mode: line">1. For a <b>�Voice vote</b>�, the 
        moderator will say �<b>All in favor indicate by saying Yea.� </b>
        followed by<b> �All against signify by saying Nay.�</b></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
        <span style="layout-grid-mode: line">2. If the moderator cannot tell the 
        outcome of the voice vote he or she can ask for a �<b>hand count�: �All 
        in favor of the motion, please raise your hand.�</b></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
        <span style="layout-grid-mode: line">3. If seven voters move to <b>
        �divide the assembly�</b>, the motion is voted by �<b>paper ballot�: �I 
        move to divide the assembly.� </b>The moderator asks �<b>Are there six 
        more voters who �second� this motion?� </b>If so, paper is passed out to 
        all voters and they indicate their vote by writing yes or no. The votes 
        are usually counted by the clerk and <b>board of civil authority </b>
        (local officials who help run the election) and are then reported to the 
        moderator.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">No matter 
        which voting method is used, a voter must be present to vote at town 
        meeting. A person cannot go home early and ask a friend or family member 
        to cast his vote for him.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">k) After the 
        vote is announced, the moderator moves to the next article on the agenda 
        by reading it to the assembly. If a voter interrupts this reading by 
        moving to reconsider the prior vote, the moderator must stop his reading 
        and ask if there is a second to the motion to reconsider. The meeting 
        may only reconsider a vote once before going to the next item on the 
        agenda.</span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">Who May 
        Participate?</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Only legal

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">This means

        meeting. To do this, the voters must pass a motion to allow the 
        individual to �address the assembly.� This motion must pass by a 
        two-thirds majority vote.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">There is a 
        well-known story about a governor who visited one of Vermont�s town 
        meetings and asked permission to address the assembly. The town was 
        unhappy about some piece of legislation the governor had supported and 
        as a result, the vote to permit her to speak to the meeting initially 
        failed. After some debate, a motion to reconsider was passed and the 
        governor was allowed to address the meeting.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">The Business of 
        the Meeting</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">At town 
        meeting voters hear and approve of reports from town officers, they 
        elect new officials, and review and approve a budget for the town.) 
        Voters also decide whether to raise money from taxes to give to groups 
        that serve the town, like a youth center, a homeless shelter or a 
        transportation program for the elderly. Some communities also vote on 
        the school budget (at a school district meeting warned for the same day 
        as town meeting).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Most items on 
        the warning for town meeting are required by Vermont law, but some 
        articles are added by the selectboard (the board of three to five people 
        who are elected to run the town) so that the board can get feedback or 
        approval from the citizens on an issue facing the town. Other articles 
        can be added by local officials or by citizens who bring in a petition 
        signed by five percent of the registered voters of the town.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Some towns 
        discuss social issues facing the state or the country like whether to 
        ban genetically engineered seeds, whether to close Vermont�s nuclear 
        power plant or whether the country should to go to war. These articles 
        are usually added to the Town Meeting warning by voters who bring a 
        petition to the selectboard, but occasionally a selectboard will agree 
        to put the articles on the warning without a petition.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Not every 
        petitioned article must be included in the warning � the topic for 
        discussion must be an issue that the voters have the power to decide.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">One 
        selectboard asked the voters to decide where the new town hall should be 
        built. This was an issue the selectboard could have decided on its own � 
        but it preferred to let the townspeople help make such an important 
        decision.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">The <b>budget
        </b>is the amount of money spent to support the town government. It pays 
        for town buildings, roads, town employees, the town library, etc . . .&nbsp; 
        The budget is paid for by taxing the property owned by individuals and 
        businesses in the town.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">Elections of 
        Local Officials</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Vermont law 
        requires voters to elect a variety of officials at town meeting. Some 
        are elected to serve for one year. Others are elected to serve for as 
        long as a three-year term.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Vermont law 
        requires local officials to be elected by paper ballot (unless they are 
        elected by Australian Ballot). </span>Towns that elect officers at a 
        floor meeting nominate candidates during the meeting (a voter will 
        nominate the candidate who can then accept or decline to run.)
        <span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Once nominations are closed, paper 
        is passed out and voters write out their preference.&nbsp; If no candidate 
        receives a majority vote the moderator will ask voters to vote again.&nbsp;
        </span>If no candidate receives a majority of the votes by the third 
        ballot, the moderator eliminates the candidate with the least votes and 
        repeats the procedure until someone receives a majority of the votes. 17 
        V.S.A. �2660(c). </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">If there is 
        only one person nominated for a position, a voter can move to direct the 
        clerk to cast a single ballot in favor of the person nominated. This 
        saves time and paper!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">In towns that 
        vote by Australian Ballot candidates the person who receives the most 
        votes wins (even if it is a plurality of votes rather than a majority.)</span> 
        Towns that elect officers by Australian Ballot require candidates to 
        submit a nominating petition signed by 30 voters or one percent of the checklist 
        � whichever is less<b>.&nbsp; </b>The petition must clearly indicate the 
        office and term length on the petition prior to circulating it for 
        signatures. 17 V.S.A. �2681(b). The nominating petition must be filed 
        with the municipal clerk no later than 5:00 p.m. on the sixth Monday 
        preceding the day of the election.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">In many towns 
        it is difficult to find people willing to run for every town office. If 
        no one is elected at town meeting, the office is <b>�</b>vacant�.<b> </b>
        The selectboard must appoint someone to fill the vacancy.</span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">The Australian 
        Ballot Alternative</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Most towns 
        have adopted the <b>Australian Ballot </b>system of voting for at least 
        some of the articles at town meeting. We also run our state elections 
        using Australian Ballot.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">The Australian 
        Ballot is a secret ballot. Under this system of voting, polls are open 
        from at least 10:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m. and voters can show up at any 
        time to vote by marking a printed ballot. Australian Ballot Voting was 
        adopted in Vermont in 1892. It was the system of voting that was being 
        used at that time in Australia.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">In contrast to 
        floor voting at a traditional town meeting, the Australian Ballot allows 
        people to vote quickly and at a time that is convenient for them. This 
        system also allows a person who is sick or out of town, or who prefers 
        not to come to the polls on Election Day, to vote early or vote by mail 
        by an <b>absentee ballot</b>. Ballots are delivered to sick or disabled 
        voters. At a traditional town meeting you have to be present to vote � 
        if you are sick or at work you miss out. It is not surprising that towns 
        that use the Australian Ballot generally have much higher voter 
        participation rates than those that do not.</span>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">A town must 
        vote to use the Australian Ballot system. Most towns choose to vote on 
        some topics this way and vote others at the traditional meeting. The law 
        also requires certain votes be by Australian Ballot � such as votes on 
        whether to borrow money for over ten years to build a new town building. 
        Most towns use Australian Ballot to elect town officers. In contrast to 
        traditional town meeting, where articles are routinely amended, the 
        Australian Ballot system requires voters to vote yes or no to an 
        article. </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Under 
        Australian Ballot voting, a warned article calling for the town to spend 
        up to $180,000 for a new fire truck lets voters either accept or reject 
        the proposal. If a voter thinks the selectboard is asking them to pay 
        too much for the truck, all the voter can do is vote no � the voter 
        cannot write in an alternative proposal. </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">If the article 
        is rejected, the selectboard can choose to not buy the truck or it can 
        call a second vote at some later date, proposing a smaller amount to be 
        spent for the truck. In contrast, at a traditional town meeting any voter 
        may suggest amending the article to allow the town to spend less for the 
        truck. It can all be done at the same meeting � with no need to call for 
        a second vote.</span></p>

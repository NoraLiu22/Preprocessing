"In acquiring...governance of the land, we agree to cherish its earth, waters, plants, and animals
in a way that promotes the health, stability, and diversity of the whole community. This entails attentive
stillness to meet and know the land as an active presence. It entails study, observation, shared reflection,
and cumulative...experience to increase and bequeath our understanding of ecosystem health, stability, and
diversity. It entails symbiotic naturalization into the land community-a communion of actual nurture and
shelter. As elaborated by these entailments, fully accountable governance-stewardship-is the distinctly
human way of bonding into one society with all who share in the land's life, which is the foundation for
instituting a biocentric ethic among humankind."

<u>Introduction</u>
</center>

       One of the most unique characteristics of the Central Lowlands of Connecticut
is the traprock ridge that runs from Long Island Sound to Massachusetts. Ranging to
over one thousand feet above sea level in Meriden, the "Metacomet Ridge" contains
some of the last wilderness areas in Central Connecticut, and has been designated as
critical habitat by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). For
the most part, the Ridge has escaped development due to its steep slopes, rugged
faces, and aquifer recharge function. However, as open space in towns and cities
along the Ridge disappears, the Ridge has become a target for various economic
interests, including quarrying for construction materials.
<p>
       The problem of dwindling wilderness is global in scale. We are all familiar with
the international outcry against the destruction of the tropical rainforests and the
concurrent loss of biodiversity; yet we fail to consider the loss of the temperate forest
that is occurring in our midst. Only a few centuries ago, the Eastern Forest harbored a
diverse plant and animal community, with moose and elk, wolves and wolverines,
cougar, lynx, and bobcat. The early settlers began the sequence of destruction,
clearing the land for farming and timber, catalyzing the division of the expansive forest
into fragments that today are nothing more than remnants of true wilderness with few
of its original inhabitants.
<p>
       Even though there is now more forested land than 100 years ago, the presence
of a forest is not necessarily analogous to a healthy, native ecosystem (Biltonen,
1992). What is required is the restoration of the native plant and animal community
that existed prior to the advent of our forbears. 
<p>
       This plan represents a biologically-viable framework to unite land owners,
municipalities, and concerned citizens to work towards the restoration of wilderness in
the Central Lowlands of Connecticut.
<p>
<center>
<u>Wilderness in Central Connecticut?</u>
</center>
       Webster defines wilderness as "an area essentially undisturbed by human
activity together with its naturally developed life community." Pioneering
Conservationist Aldo Leopold (1949) called wilderness a "base-datum of normality, a
picture of how healthy land maintains itself as an organism." In heavily-populated
Central Connecticut, a casual observer would most-likely surmise that there is no
wilderness in the region. However, the traprock ridge, "green and forested strips of
wild land that bisect the heavily-developed Central Valley" (Bell, 1985), is an obvious
candidate for wilderness recovery in the area. Large semi-contiguous tracts along the
ridge currently exist in Meriden, Southington, Berlin, New Britain, and Plainville. Within
each of these tracts lie many different types of ecosystems.
<p>
       An ecosystem is the community of microorganisms, plants, animals, and their
physical environment interconnected by an intricate web of relationships (Erlich, et.al.,
1970). There are many communities along and within the traprock range: hilltop,
midslope, and low slope oak forests; hemlock and beech forests; exposed ledge,
talus, and rock ravine communities; wooded and shrub swamps; marshes; stream and
stream bank communities; and man-made lakes (Jorgenson, 1978). The physical and
biological diversity within this area is the product of millions of years of geological and
evolutionary activity. Local biodiversity is enhanced by the topography of the area:
rapid elevation changes, ravines, and various slope exposures provide habitat for
many organisms living at the northern or southern extreme of their normal distribution.
For these reasons, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection has
designated the traprock range as a "critical habitat" and cites over twenty rare,
threatened, or endangered species that may exist in the area (Dowhan and Craig,
1976).
<p>
<center>
<em>Wilderness Destruction</em>
</center>
       A diverse biological community has the ability to resist environmental
perturbations because of the existence of different species whose roles in the system
overlap (Odum, 1971). When this diversity is reduced, the ecosystem becomes
unstable and functionally unreliable. Furthermore, a reduction in biodiversity is
accompanied by a contraction of the gene pool, which slows or stops the natural
evolutionary process and impinges on a particular species' ability to adapt to the
environmental change.
<p>
       Wilcox and Murphy (1985) stated that "habitat fragmentation is the most serious
threat to biological diversity and is the primary cause of the current extinction crisis."
When a habitat is fragmented, the resultant communities become genetically isolated
with concurrent loss of variation and resilience. Human-induced fragmentation creates
unnatural habitat boundaries which allow opportunistic non-native species to interact
with native species; this triggers a cascade effect of increased competition,
susceptibility to parasitism, vulnerability, displacement, and loss. For example, the
brown-headed cowbird (a non-native but local species) prefers fragmented and open
landscapes and lays its eggs in the nests of native songbirds, causing a sharp
reduction in juvenile songbird populations within 100 meters of openings (Brittingham
and Temple, 1983). By preserving core wilderness areas, parasite populations may be
minimized and native songbird populations salvaged.
<p>
       The structure (natural composition, diversity, and relative abundance), function
(natural flows and cycles), and integrity (quality based on structure and function:
naturalness) of ecosystems must be ensured through preservation and restoration
(Noss, 1991a). Harmonic wilderness can only be ensured by halting fragmentation and
development and through the establishment of wilderness corridors that allow the
unimpeded transfer of genetic material across the region. Wilderness areas and
corridors would serve as genetic reservoirs from which remnant external populations
could draw genetic material and thus be saved from extinction.
<p>
       The State of Connecticut Council on Environmental Quality (Council on
Environmental Quality, Connecticut Environment Review, 1991) has identified habitat
fragmentation as the "single greatest factor" in the reduction of the quality of
Connecticut's wilderness and proactively supports local efforts to establish corridors to
stem the rising tide of wilderness loss. 
<p>
<center>
<u>The Traprock Wilderness Recovery Strategy</u>
</center>
       The Traprock Wilderness Recovery Strategy (TWRS) is an ecosystem
preservation plan designed to maintain and increase local biodiversity through the
creation of the Traprock Wilderness/Evolutionary Preserve System. It is the local
component of a project to create an interconnected network of restored wilderness in
the East.  This proposal endeavors to gain the preservation of the ridge in perpetuity
through preservation commitments from land owners, stewards, and government
agencies.
<p>
       The TRWS consists of three phases:
<p>
             Phase 1: Planning. This phase includes preliminary field reconnaissance,
             mapping (including Geographical Information Systems (GIS) work), and
             presentation of the plan to local and state officials and land stewards.
             Significant revision of the plan based on regional feedback will occur in
             Phase 1.
<p>
             Phase 2: Implementation. This phase includes the preparation of legal
             documents to secure preservation of the region; physical posting of the
             core and inner/outer buffer zones; and efforts to ensure the integrity of
             the preserve (preventing ATV access, illegal hunting, etc.).
<p>
             Phase 3: Perpetuation and expansion. The final phase involves the
             ongoing effort to maintain the preserve; recruitment of new landholders
             into the project to expand the area of the preserve; the restoration of
             extirpated species via natural migration; and the elimination of non-native
             species.
<p>
       While the proposed TW/EP is smaller in area than most wilderness restoration
projects, it meets many of the wilderness restoration criteria as suggested by Noss
(1991b), such as repeated intervals of habitat types to include climatic, topographic,
and population-dynamic variations and intersite linkage of small areas into a functional
network. A. Starker Leopold (1969) provided the land ethic foundation when he said
that "each unit...should be viewed as an independent microcosm with many biological
features and values of its own, all of which should be appreciated and sustained in
some harmonious combination." Every piece of preserved and restored wilderness
contributes to the preservation of evolutionary integrity.
<p>
<center>
<u>The Preserve Matrix: Cores, Buffers, and Corridors</u>
</center>
       The Traprock Wilderness Recovery Strategy employs the Multiple Use Model
(MUM) developed by Reed Noss and L.F. Harris (1986) as a management tool. The
MUM consists of core regions managed for native biodiversity, surrounded by buffer
zones, and connected by wilderness corridors. In preserves with multiple separate
core areas, intercore corridors are established to provide core connectivity.

       Core areas within a given preserve would be located in relatively remote areas,
away from development, roads, and hiking trails. No ecosystem-altering activity
(mining, roadbuilding, ORV use, new hiking trails, etc.) would be allowed within the
core to allow for population and diversity rebound. A strong ecological community
within the core would enhance surrounding biotic populations.
       Buffers serve to isolate the core from the intensively used land surrounding the
preserve and provide supplemental habitat for native species inhabiting the core. Inner
buffer zones surround the core, and allow for limited use such as hiking, cross-country
skiing, and birding. Outer buffer zones allow for heavier recreational use, light road
use, biologically-viable silviculture, and attenuation of adverse edge effects.
       Wilderness corridors provide dwelling habitat as extensions of reserves; provide
for seasonal movement of wildlife and the dispersal and genetic interchange between
core reserves; and allow for latitudinal and elevational range shifts with climatic
change. 
<p>
       TWRS preserve design was based on a number of criteria, including road and
utility line locations, topography, and historical land use patterns. Due to the relatively
small overall preserve size, designated core zones include no roads, trails, or power
and gas lines. Inner and outer buffer design was based on perimeter condition,
historical land use evidence, and ledge location.
<p>
       Corridors along the TW/EP vary from excellent to marginal. Overall, the regional
interstate highway system delineates the northern and southern boundaries of the
project. Interpreserve corridor design was based on topographic and historical use
data (low-use roadways and boundary characteristics). Coreless preserves such as
South Mountain function as major corridors linking the largest preserves. Long linear
corridors (i.e., Cathole Mountain) and discontinuous tracts of undeveloped land
adjacent to the preserves provide supplemental dwelling habitat, facilitate wildlife
egress and ingress, and prevent adverse land use around the preserve.
<p>
<center>
<u>The TW/EP System - Component Preserves</u>
</center>
       The TWRS encompasses five preserves: South Mountain, East Peak/West
Peak, Short Mountain, Ragged Mountain, and Bradley Mountain. Most of the
preserves contain glacially-exposed faces, outcrops, and ravines which contribute to
habitat variety and microclimatic diversity. While the entire system functions as a
corridor, a preserve generally consists of core, buffer, and corridor zones.
Furthermore, a number of significant adjunct tracts have been identified that have
been included in the plan.
<p>
<center>
<u>Unifying the System: The Challenge</u>
</center>
       The TWRS is a first step towards saving the remnant wilderness areas in the
Central Valley. Since the plan does not include land acquisition, its success will be
wholly dependent on the landowners, land stewards, municipalities, and citizens of the
region.
<p>
       State agency support for projects such as the TWRS can be found in the State
Policies Plan for the Conservation and Development of Connecticut (Connecticut
Office of Policy and Management, 1987), the Connecticut endangered species
document (Dowhan and Craig, 1976), and in the Connecticut Council on
Environmental Quality Report (Council on Environmental Quality, Connecticut
Environment Review, 1991). However, new acquisition and preservation efforts by the
State are limited due to financial constraints; only through local and regional citizen
initiatives and state/local cooperatives will land such as the traprock ridges be
preserved. Several ridge properties have been purchased by state and local
cooperatives in the last few years in Branford and Rocky Hill, and the largest
cooperative project in Connecticut is underway in Cheshire (Hickey, 1992).
<p>
       A significant area of land within the preserve system is owned by local water
utilities. The preservation of land for water supply uses and wilderness are infinitely
compatible, as "the purest untreated water comes from dense, unmanipulated forest"
(New Britain Water Department Watershed Management Plan, 1990).
       From the municipal government perspective, the existence of a large regional
wilderness area has many benefits, including aesthetic and quality-of-life value and
citizen initiatives to curb illegal activites within the preserve. The authors of the
Southington Master Plan for Development found that well over one-half of the
residents they surveyed stated that the rural character of Southington was its greatest
quality (Veri, 1990).
       Landowners within and around the preserve benefit through increased land
values relative to land in developed areas (Small, 1990) and through the protection
afforded their land by concerned citizens.
       A number of approaches to the establishment of the preserve are possible,
including:

 <ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>      -     An alliance of landowners and stewards who collectively modify their land deeds (via preservation easements) to ensure preservation in perpetuity;
<li>       -     A cooperative effort between state and local agencies to jointly purchase land for preservation;
<li>       -     donations of land to local steward groups/land trusts;
<li>       -     creation of a citizen's covenant, by which residents collectively contribute funds to purchase preserve space and become land stewards through a share system.
</ul>


       Given the complex ownership conditions present along the ridge, a combination
of these approaches would be required. ConnPAW is willing to coordinate the process
if no local or regional preservation group is willing to manage the project. During the
Phase I comment period, ConnPAW will work to provide landowners with research and
information services on request.
       The traprock ridges of the Central Valley contain the last vestiges of wilderness
in our region. Through cooperative initiatives such as the TWRS, we can preserve the
wild places and their natural communities.

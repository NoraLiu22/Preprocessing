    signed 14 March 1944, the Coast Guard was designated to man certain small
    Army Transportation Corps vessels (with some already operating in the
    Southwest Pacific and manned at the time by civilians).&nbsp; The agreement
    reads: &quot;The Coast Guard, due to decrease in category of defense in the
    United States, will have some personnel available to man ships and craft for
    which civilian personnel cannot be obtained.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

    vessels).&nbsp; The Coast Guard manned a total of 288 of these Army craft.&nbsp;
    One, the FS-34, was was of the type &quot;Design 277&quot;, FS-140 through
    FS-234 were &quot;Design 330,&quot; and the rest were &quot;Design

      <p><b><i><font face="Arial">FS-150</font></i></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The Coast Guard-manned Army vessel FS-150 was
      commissioned 20 September 1944 in the Southwest Pacific area where she
      operated.&nbsp; On the morning of 21 June 1945 at 0620 according to a
      report signed by LTJG D.W. Ellis, commanding officer, the FS-150, out of
      Hollandia and bound for Finschaven, New Guinea, received an SOS from the
      U.S. Liberty Ship Millen Griffiths stating that it had run aground on the
      coast of New Guinea, just north of Finschaven and that it had a
      &quot;strong leak.&quot;&nbsp; The FS-150 immediately set course for the
      given position of the grounded vessel and at 0716 was standing by her to
      offer whatever assistance she could give. The Liberty ship had over 1000
      Australian troops aboard which the FS-150 offered to help evacuate. There
      had been a storm earlier that morning, however, and as the sea was still
      rough, the master of the Millen Griffiths decided to wait for better
      conditions before having the troops removed.&nbsp; The FS-150 stood by
      until 0830 when two tugs arrived on the scene and being signaled that it
      could be of no further assistance the FS-150 proceeded to Finschaven.&nbsp;
      At 1025 the FS-150 and FS-176 were asked by the Army to go back to the
      Griffiths to stand by for further assistance and they were so doing by
      1115.&nbsp; At 1520 the FS-150 moved alongside the Griffiths and began
      taking her troops aboard, and at 1730 cast off all lines and set course
      for Finschaven with approximately 500 troops aboard.&nbsp; The FS-176 also
      removed about 500 troops from the stricken vessel and by 1900 the 1000 or
      so troops had been sent ashore at Finschaven.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b><i><font face="Arial">FS-151</font></i></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The Coast Guard manned Army vessel FS-151 was
      commissioned at New Orleans on 17 April 1944.&nbsp; By 26 June 1944, the
      vessel was in the Southwest Pacific area.&nbsp; On 23 July 1945 at 0648,
      in position 02 59' N, 133 20' E, while en route from Biak to the
      Philippines the Coast Guard manned Army vessel FS-142 intercepted an SOS
      distress message from an unknown vessel on 500 kilocycles.&nbsp; After
      obtaining D/F bearings to verify position given in distress message, the
      course was changed to close that position some 80 miles away.&nbsp; The
      distressed vessel could not decode a message stating the ETA.&nbsp; All
      subsequent radio communication was in plain language.&nbsp; The distressed
      vessel was sighted at 1640 and the FS-142 arrived on scene at 1730.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Present was USMC type N-3 vessel<i> William F.
      Howard</i> which had arrived about 30 minutes earlier and was lying one
      mile off the reef.&nbsp; The distressed vessel was the FS-151 stranded on
      the east side of Helen Reef, 6 miles from Helen Island in position 02 52'
      N, 131 40' E, heading in a northeasterly direction, drawing 4.5 feet of
      water forward and normal draft aft.&nbsp; Breakers were about her port
      side resulting from a moderate SW wind and the sea was sweeping the reef.
      The starboard side of the FS-151 was in deeper water.&nbsp; Her booms were
      swung out to port.&nbsp; Two warps were out astern leading to deeper
      water.&nbsp; The FS-142 closed the distressed vessel and following blinker
      conversation regarding the general situation it was decided at 1800 to try
      pulling her off on the chance that she was not badly stranded.&nbsp; After
      the third attempt, a cable was passed and made fast to FS-151 at 1826.&nbsp;
      The cable broke loose from the bit of the FS-151, but the distressed
      vessel did not budge.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Further attempts were abandoned because of darkness,
      strong currents and inadaptability of the FS-142 to such work.&nbsp; It
      was obvious that it would take a powerful tug to get the FS-151 off.&nbsp;
      At 1910 the <i>Howard</i> departed and at 1950 the FS-142 advised the
      FS-151 that they would be standing by at some distance off the reef
      because of possible enemy submarine attack following the plain language
      communications.&nbsp; The FS-151's personnel were in no immediate danger.&nbsp;
      At 2110 an intercepted message from <i>Nerk</i>, a naval war vessel, to
      FS-151 stated that she would stand by off the reef and close in the
      morning if no immediate assistance was required.&nbsp; The FS-142 advised
      that she was in the vicinity also.&nbsp; At 0830 on 27 July 1945, present
      at the scene were DE-367 (SOPA), APD-11, an Australian J-boat and a
      commercial tanker.&nbsp; After blinker conversation with SOPA regarding
      previous day's experience and stating the opinion that FS-151 was higher
      on reef than previous evenings SOPA decided to try and requested FS-142 to
      stand by.&nbsp; At 0942 SOPA advised that an ocean going tug was
      approaching and that FS-142 could proceed.&nbsp; After confirming, by
      blinker, that no further help was needed, FS-142 proceeded back to course
      and to destination.&nbsp; The FS-151 was apparently successfully floated.&nbsp;
      On 12 October 1945 she was decommissioned and her Coast Guard crew removed
      on 13 October 1945.</font></p>

      had the s tern blown open and the propeller and shaft bent double, was
      blown out of the cradle and hanging over the side by the forward falls.&nbsp;
      The 140 mm gun had been blown off and one ready ammunition box belonging
      to it was found on the forecastle head near the anchor winch, with 140 mm
      shells about forward of #1 hatch.&nbsp; The ship had buckled between #2
      hatch and the bridge structure with foot high ridges in the deck plating,
      extending down the sides of the ship into the water.&nbsp; Examination of
      the crews quarters indicated that MoMM 2/c Lewis Cohen and Steward
      Theodore R. Strong who were sleeping in the crew's quarters aft were
      nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; MoMM 1/c Robert Swett and SC 1/c Richard E.

      LCI-21 was signaled that the FS-255 had been hit.&nbsp; The ship was
      settling fast and two life rafts were launched and men ordered to board

      <p><font face="Arial">Shortly after 2200 on 10 July 1945, the sky at
      Zamboanga, Philippines was illuminated by a column of flame that climbed
      200 feet in the air.&nbsp; The entire fuel dock appeared ablaze.&nbsp; All
      hands on the FS-280 mere awaiting the explosion of the two large tankers
      known to be moored there.&nbsp; LT Waldron, commanding officer of the
      FS-280, assembled a fire and rescue party consisting of himself and five
      Coast Guard enlisted man and proceeded to the scene, two miles away in the
      motor launch.&nbsp; As they approached, the fire seemed to be slackening
      in intensity and they were able to distinguish the source of the blaze,
      which were dolphins to which the inboard tanker USS <i>Stonewall</i>
      (IX-185) was secured.&nbsp; Flaming oil filled the area between the
      dolphins and the fire encompassed a total area of 300 square feet with 2
      or 3 small fires on the decks of the two tankers 200 feet from the
      outboard tanker, <i>M. V. China</i>, a native vinta was observed aflame 75
      feet of f the bow of the Stonewall. The flames were 3 feet high and
      appeared to arise from three distinct sources of fuel within the vinta.&nbsp;
      The Coast Guardsmen proceeded down the seaward side of the <i>China</i>
      and observed a lifeboat overcrowded with an excited Chinese crew.&nbsp;
      Going alongside they quieted the Chinese and directed them to follow them
      to the fuel dock.&nbsp; Swinging under the stern of the <i>Stonewall</i>
      they observed that four hoses were hooked up on the port side aft and fire
      fighters aboard the <i>Stonewall</i> were directing three streams at a
      surface oil fire, 50 feet long, blazing under the counter and along the
      port quarter.&nbsp; The other hose was cooling the mid-ship sides, dock,
      and dolphins that it could reach.&nbsp; The launch headed in and attempted
      to douse the flames by splashing water with floorboards ripped from the
      launch, but the blaze spread and they ware forced back.&nbsp; A hose was
      requested and lowered and the flames under the port quarter were
      extinguished within five minutes.&nbsp; Flames still leaped from a forward
      dolphin just beyond reach of the ship's hose and the Coast Guardsmen
      requested another hose and easing under the dock that drenched the only
      remaining dolphin afire.&nbsp; Approaching within 20 feet with a third
      length of hose their solid stream made short work of the blaze. Going
      aboard the <i>Stonewall</i>, after the hull and remaining dolphins had
      been drenched to cool them off, it was learned that an accidental
      discharge of five barrels of aviation gasoline had been set afire by
      sparks from a native boat.&nbsp; Only the courageous action of the fire
      fighters on board the two tankers had prevented them from being blown
      &quot;galley west.&quot;&nbsp; It had been touch and go with hundreds of
      gallons of gasoline within 50 feet of the last flame to be extinguished.&nbsp;
      The five Coast Guardsmen who worked with LT Waldrop for an hour to save
      the two tankers acted in the best traditions of the Coast Guard and were
      recommended for recognition. They were:</font></p>

      Departing New York early in May 1944, the FS-309 proceeded to Los Angeles,
      via Panama Canal.&nbsp; En route to Honolulu from Los Angeles the FS-309
      was in a collision with a Navy destroyer 150 miles off the coast.&nbsp;
      With her starboard side caved in and number two hold full of water, but
      with no one injured, the crew shifted the cargo to the port side and
      rigged a collision mat, taking her to Los Angeles under her own power.&nbsp;
      The damage was repaired, the skipper exonerated by a Navy Board and the
      FS-309 proceeded to New Guinea, via Honolulu and Ellice Islands.&nbsp; At
      Milne Bay, New Guinea she unloaded and reloaded for Hollandia and joined a
      convoy for the Philippines.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">As she approached Leyte the crew was notified that
      &quot;enemy air attack can be expected at any time,&quot; but they sailed
      up Leyte Bay without firing a shot.&nbsp; A few days later, however, on
      Christmas Eve, 1944, the airfield at Tacloban was attacked and she began
      shooting at enemy planes along with shore batteries.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Sailing shortly afterward for Mindoro, the FS-309
      was subject to concentrated attacks from enemy kamikazes while steaming
      through the Surigao Straits, the Mindanao Sea, the Sulu Sea and the
      Mindoro Straits on 28 December 1944.&nbsp; The convoy shot down some 26
      enemy planes.&nbsp; The FS-309's guns fired into one Zero, putting her
      ablaze shortly before she banked into the ammunition-laden USS <i>Porcupine</i>
      (IX-120) 200 yards ahead.&nbsp; A&nbsp; terrific explosion followed, the
      concussion picking everybody several feet off the deck of the FS-309 and
      tearing the flying bridge to pieces with all shatter proof windows which
      were not down being completely pulverized.&nbsp; As the smoke rose from
      the <i>Porcupine</i>, the remnants of the ill-fated ship were seen falling
      from the sky into the sea as shrapnel littered the deck, with booms, life
      rafts, hatches, etc. of the ill-starred ship dropping not 20 feet ahead of
      the FS-309.&nbsp; Out of the smoky area, three huge, mountainous waves
      were seen approaching and two men were seen frantically waving and
      shouting in the water.&nbsp; The FS-309 maneuvered closer and Francis L.
      Owens, USCGR, of the FS-309's crew jumped overboard. He carried lines to
      them and they were rescued.&nbsp; The two men turned out not to be from
      the <i>Porcupine</i>, but from a Navy vessel in the column to the left of
      the FS-309. They had been blown overboard in the <i>Porcupine </i>explosion.&nbsp;
      The enemy had scored three hits.&nbsp; The <i>Porcupine </i>had entirely
      disappeared except for a floating body and two others were seen abandoned
      and burning in the distance.&nbsp; Attacks continued while anchored off
      Mindoro Island and the FS-309 went to the aid of a burning gasoline tanker
      hit by suicide divers and rescued her crew.&nbsp; On 31 January 1945, the
      FS-309 pulled into the partially wrecked Wawa River Wharf at Nasugbu Bay
      where the last 300 defenders of Bataan and Corregidor had been landed and
      held prisoner for many days, many of them dying for want of medical care.&nbsp;
      Here enemy &quot;Q&quot; boats--small fast speedboats carrying two depth
      charges aft and attacking shipping at anchor with suicidal intent were
      known to be operating.&nbsp; The FS-309 was the first United States vessel
      to remain overnight.&nbsp; A raft extending out from the ship was
      accordingly built to provide additional protection.&nbsp; Five days later,
      the expected &quot;Q&quot; boat attack came.&nbsp; Shortly after 1 AM, a
      watch sighted three helmeted Japanese in a motorboat.&nbsp; He gave the
      alarm and the searchlight was turned on them.&nbsp; Not 50 yards away they
      became confused and ran into the raft near the fantail.&nbsp; The
      explosion that followed blew the Japanese and the &quot;Q&quot; boat into
      the air and lifted the stern of the FS-309 out of the water.&nbsp; So
      great was the explosion that a lifeboat on the FS-309's boat deck was
      completely filled with sand and water. Crewmembers just starting for their
      battle stations were thrown violently on deck while water poured into
      their quarters through weather doors and passageways. The men thought an
      enemy aerial bomb had hit the ship.&nbsp; No one was hurt and the ship was
      comparatively undamaged thanks to the protective raft.&nbsp; The bodies of
      a Japanese captain and lieutenant were found, indicating the importance of
      the mission.&nbsp; If they had succeeded the dock would have been rendered
      useless for some time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On 19 August 1945, the FS-309 was at Manila when the
      Japanese delegation arrived by air to receive General MacArthur's peace
      terms.&nbsp; Later she proceeded to Japan as part of the occupation force.&nbsp;

      officer was LTJG Howard V. Reckhow, USCGR.&nbsp; Departing New Orleans on
      25 May 1944, she reached Long Beach, CA on 23 June 1944, via Guantanamo,
      Cuba, and the Panama Canal.&nbsp; She sailed for Oro Bay, New Guinea on 13
      July 1944, via Hawaii, Ellice Islands, New Hebrides, and Guadalcanal
      arriving at Milne Bay, New Guinea en route on 21 August 1944.&nbsp; Two
      months spent traveling up and down the New Guinea coast brought her to
      such places as Finschhafen, Hollandia, and Biak.&nbsp; At Biak she was
      under fire from Japanese bombers who attacked a nearby airstrip, but she
      was not allowed to fire on them.&nbsp; On 7 November 1944 she left
      Hollandia, in convoy, for San Pedro Bay and Tacloban, Leyte, Philippines,
      where she arrived under constant day and night air raids.&nbsp; The crew
      spent half the time at general quarters.&nbsp; On 24 November 1944 a
      large-scale attack by 80 Japanese planes, 30 of them broke through the
      combat air patrol to bomb and strafe the air strips and shipping in the
      harbor.&nbsp; A 20-mm shell hit her deck spraying shrapnel among her
      50-calibre machine gun crews, wounding the gunnery officer and five
      enlisted men, none seriously.&nbsp; All were awarded the Purple Heart. The
      gun crews claimed hits, but no definite &quot;kill&quot; could be
      established because of the numerous other vessels that were firing at the
      enemy planes during the action.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Loaded with steel strips to be used for landing mats
      on airstrips, the FS-366 left Leyte on 9 January 1945 en route to the
      Lingayen Gulf beachhead.&nbsp; As the weather cleared en route and
      detection by the enemy became easier as they approached the Southwest
      coast of Mindoro, a Kamikaze hurled up against the side of a liberty ship
      alongside the FS-366.&nbsp; The liberty ship was holed amidships just
      above the waterline and great clouds of smoke poured forth.&nbsp; She
      managed to keep going, however, and eventually made port. Constant enemy
      attacks at irregular intervals followed on the route to Lingayen Gulf,
      which was finally reached 13 January 1945 (D+4).&nbsp; The FS-366 remained
      anchored in Lingayen Gulf on emergency standby, on guard each night for
      suicide swimmers with bombs on their backs and Q boats.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Proceeding to Nasugbu, south of the entrance to
      Manila Bay, a beachhead established by the 11th Airborne Division who were
      pushing inland toward the city of Manila, they returned to Subic Bay for
      cargo for Batangas in Southern Luzon, where our troops were still
      fighting.&nbsp; They were with the first cargo ships to dock there and
      were warmly greeted by the natives.&nbsp; The sane was true of Lemery and
      Taul where they stopped en route.&nbsp; On 31 March 1945, the FS-366
      entered Manila Bay where sporadic fighting was still in progress.&nbsp;
      The city was in sad shape, the Japanese having destroyed the waterfront
      and docks and downtown section, where its stately modern buildings were
      almost completely reduced to rubble.&nbsp; Proceeding soon to Cavite, they
      took a cargo of ammunition to Batangas, returning to Manila on 15 April
      1945.&nbsp; Toward the end of April they took another load of ammunition
      to the town of Legaspi on the eastern coast of Luzon and for the next few
      months hauled ammunition between Lingayen, Subic Bay, Manila, Batangas and
      Legaspi.&nbsp; Late in May 1945 the FS-366 entered a floating drydock near
      Guinan for a long needed overhaul and paint job.&nbsp; In July 1945 she
      carried a cargo of high-octane gas to Abulug, near Aparri, where our
      airborne troops had landed.&nbsp; Thence, she proceeded to Damortis in
      Lingayen Gulf for another load of ammunition for Aparri . After several
      more runs to Aparri, San Fernando, Subic Bay, Manila, the FS-366 proceeded
      to Mindanao.&nbsp; On her return to Manila her Coast Guard crew was taken
      off and she was decommissioned on 22 September 1945.&nbsp; A Philippine
      crew relieved the Coast Guard men.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">The Coast Guard-manned Army vessel FS-367 was
      commissioned April 29, 1944, with LTJG R.H. Greenless, USCGR, as
      commanding officer.&nbsp; She reached her final destination in the
      Philippines on 30 December 1944. In Operation L-3, near San Jose, Mindoro
      Island, Philippines, she anchored 500 yards off Bulong Point midway
      between Blue and White beaches.&nbsp; The USS <i>Mariposa</i>, Navy X-126,
      Liberty-type, converted oil tanker, dropped anchor about 300 yards away
      and some 800 yards from shore.&nbsp; At 1530 Japanese planes, in a sudden
      and devastating attack of shipping in the harbor sunk or damaged 24 ships.&nbsp;
      One crashed the USS <i>Arturus</i>, a PT-boat tender, which sank almost
      immediately.&nbsp; A second made a low level strafing and bombing attack
      on a group of LSTs unloading at White Beach blowing the stern off one of
      them and than turned on the Mariposa, into which it crash dived.&nbsp; The
      tanker immediately burst into flames and a number of the crew either were
      blown or jumped into the water.&nbsp; The FS- 367 went to her assistance.
      At the same time a third Japanese plane made a low-level attack on the
      destroyers outside the harbor, straddling two destroyers with bombs and
      finally crashing into the USS <i>Ganesvoort</i>, which immediately began
      to burn and settle in the water, being assisted by two other destroyers,
      in a sinking condition.&nbsp; Proceeding to assist the <i>Mariposa</i>,
      the FS-367 took several men aboard with her boarding net and James D.
      Ellis sighting a man struggling in the water and calling for help, dove
      into the water and supported him until both were picked up by an LSM.&nbsp;
      The FS-367 stayed alongside the <i>Mariposa</i> until all survivors had
      been taken off.&nbsp; About 1900 the FS-367 withdrew out of the line of
      fire of guns that were about to shell the <i>Mariposa</i>.&nbsp; Later,
      this was cancelled and the <i>Ganesvoort </i>launched 2 torpedoes into
      her. Immediately thereafter a great amount of burning gasoline spread over
      the bay making the FS-367's anchorage unsafe.&nbsp; As she was preparing
      to move, the <i>Ganesvoort </i>requested she come alongside and take off
      her crew.&nbsp; By the time she had reached the destroyer, however, the
      gasoline had spread so widely that the <i>Ganesvoort </i>was in immediate
      danger of being engulfed.&nbsp; The FS-367, instead of stopping to take
      off personnel, warped alongside the destroyer and began towing her to a
      safe anchorage.&nbsp; While so occupied another alert sounded and a
      Japanese plane was shot down immediately overhead.&nbsp; The FS-367
      finally got the <i>Ganesvoort </i>to safety several hundred yards off
      White Beach.&nbsp; The next day the <i>Ganesvoort </i>was abandoned by her
      crew in a sinking condition.&nbsp; No casualties ware suffered by the
      FS-367.&nbsp; She was decommissioned 24 September 1945.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">On 16 September 1945, while anchored at Hagushi,
      Okinawa with the steering assembly disabled by a typhoon on 11 September
      1945, while en route from Tacloban to Hagushi, a report of another typhoon
      which would pass close to the east of Okinawa was received.&nbsp; At 1300
      on the 16th T.C. 95.5.2 cleared the harbor to weather the typhoon at sea,
      but small ships such as FS-, LT-, and several Navy tankers and Liberty
      ships remained at anchor an the harbor.&nbsp; By 1100 on the 16th the wind
      had reached 25 knots coming from NE and the barometer read 29.148.&nbsp;
      Sea watches were set and anchor chain veered to 100 fathoms in 15 fathoms
      of water 1 mile off shore.&nbsp; The engines were started and kept warm
      until she got underway, at 0410 on 17 September 1945.&nbsp; A jury
      steering gear was set up.&nbsp; By 1900 on the 16th the wind had reached
      70 knots from the NE and the barometer read 28.87.&nbsp; The ship was
      rolling 15 degrees, but the anchor did not appear to be dragging.&nbsp; By
      2200 the wind had shifted and was coming from the NW at 70 knots while the
      barometer read 28.52.&nbsp; By 0200 on the 17th the wind had again shifted
      to WNW with velocity at 70 knots, there being no protection from land with
      the wind from that direction.&nbsp; The ship was rolling and pitching and
      the anchor dragged slightly.&nbsp; By 0300 on the 17th, the barometer had
      risen to 28.81. At 0410 in a deep pitch of the ship the stern came down on
      a reef and the ship immediately got underway at flank speed, the stern
      hitting the reef again at 0413 and the anchor windlass being unable to
      take in the chain because of the heavy strain on it.&nbsp; The anchor
      chain, being welded in a pad-eye in the chain locker could not be slipped
      and they proceeded dragging the port anchor and maneuvering among ships
      anchored in the harbor with the use of engines.&nbsp; At 0600 she dropped
      back on her anchor about 1.5 miles off shore with both engines slow ahead.&nbsp;
      The wind and sea were still from the WNW with wind velocity at 70 knots,
      but the barometer had risen to 29.06.&nbsp; The ship was pitching heavily
      and rolling more than 40 degrees.&nbsp; At 0730, having taken in the port
      anchor, she proceeded WNW heading into the wind, a difficult operation
      with the jury rig steering, necessitating constant use of the engine for
      steering.&nbsp; At 0900 a visual message was sent to Navy tug #28 to stand
      by for assistance, the jury rig being inefficient for steering and there
      being heavy vibration from a bent propeller blade.&nbsp; At 1100 on the
      17th the wind had decreased to 40 knots from the WNW and the barometer had
      risen to 29.40.&nbsp; She had proceeded pitching and rolling to Naha
      Harbor with Navy tug #28 standing by.&nbsp; She entered Naha Harbor at
      1300 as wind decreased to 30 knots and barometer rose to 29.44.&nbsp; On
      the 18th an examination of hatches showed only a slight shift cargo in No.
      1 hold, consisting of 90 tons of engineering supplies, but due to a shift
      in No. 2 hold the ship had a port list of 2 or 3 degrees, which could not
      be taken off with the starboard fuel and water tanks topped.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On 8 October 1945, while anchored in Naha, Okinawa,
      with the steering assembly still disabled and port propeller damaged from
      previous typhoons, a report was received that a typhoon would pass close
      to Okinawa.&nbsp; All hatches ware secured and the chain veered to 60
      fathoms port and 30 fathoms starboard.&nbsp; By 0800 on 9 October 1945,
      the wind had reached 25 knots and the barometer read 29.02. By 1300 the
      wind was 80 knots and the barometer 28.64.&nbsp; At 1355 the anchor was
      noticed to be dragging and at 1400 preparations were made to get underway
      to take the strain off the anchor chain.&nbsp; Due to high wind velocity
      and inefficiency of bent propeller she was unable to make headway and
      prevent dragging the anchor using flank speed on both engines.&nbsp; At
      1410, with her anchors still dragging, the ship was bearing down on a
      coral reef when it struck at 1425.&nbsp; By 1515 the generators were out
      of operation due to lack of water pressure and at 1700 the wind had
      reached 150 knots with the barometer reading 28.70, the ship being high on
      the coral reef.&nbsp; The water had risen to a depth of 2 feet above the
      deck plates in the engine room from holes in the hull.&nbsp; By 10 October
      the water was over the main engines and generators in the engine room, the
      lazarette was flooded to within 12 inches of the weather deck and there
      was two feet of water in the after crew's quarters coming from fittings
      leading to the lazarette.&nbsp; The vessel was eventually given up as
      lost.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">The Coast Guard-manned Army vessel FS-547 was
      commissioned 14 October 1944 at Los Angeles, CA with LT E. M. Harrison,
      USCGR as commanding officer.&nbsp; She was assigned to and operated in the
      Southwest Pacific and Western Pacific areas.&nbsp; On 11 April 1945, the
      FS-547 was sent from Manila to San Jose, Mindoro, being loaned out by
      USASOS for an indefinite period. Her duties were to deliver rations, fuel
      and equipment to units of the Philippine Army, formerly guerrillas,
      located at various ports in the Visayan area, to ports administered by the
      P.C.A.U #7, to transport Philippine Army troops from time to time and make
      any and all incidental trips which the 8th Army saw fit to set up.&nbsp;
      They ran one main monthly supply trip about the second week of each month
      that required about a week or ten days, to which three to five extra trips
      were added, all of shorter duration. The usual itinerary was from Margarin
      Bay (port of San Jose, Mindoro) to Romblon, Romblon Island, to Balanacan
      (Port of Boac, Marinduque, Island) to Calapan (Capital of Mindoro
      Province) to Lubang, Lubang Island and back to Mangarin Bay.&nbsp; Two to
      four days were spent at their base port, ordinarily to perform ship
      maintenance and repair as well as to procure ship's rations and supplies.&nbsp;
      She was decommissioned 27 October 1945.</font></p>

      a line in her propeller in Taloma Bay, Mindanao while assisting the FS-550
      that had grounded and was unable to pull herself clear.&nbsp; She was
      pulled off by the LT-636, Coast Guard-manned. No serious damage resulted.&nbsp;

      The FS-549 in an effort to assist her fouled her propeller and was unable
      to pull herself clear.&nbsp; The LT-636, Coast Guard-manned, anchored off
      FS-549, then secured to the dock and clear of the bottom, and towed her to
      safe anchorage; then anchored off the FS-550 and pulled her clear to a
      safe anchorage.&nbsp; No serious damage resulted. She was decommissioned
      24 September 1945.</font></p>

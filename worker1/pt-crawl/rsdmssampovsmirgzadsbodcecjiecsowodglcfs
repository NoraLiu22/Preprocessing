<p>The state has 217 textile mills and 101 tobacco factories in operation.</p>
<p>The average wage for a family of five, with the father and four children ages 14 to 21 working in a prosperous textile mill, is $17 to $21 per week, or no more than $1,000 per year.</p>
<p>The North Carolina Literary and Historical Association is founded to foster growth in these fields, as well as to “engender an intelligent, healthy state pride.”</p>
<p>February 21: An amendment to the North Carolina Constitution is adopted that institutes a literacy test for voting. The amendment includes a grandfather clause that allows illiterate whites to vote but effectively disfranchises the state’s African American citizens.</p>
<p>November: Democrats regain control of the governorship and the legislature through a virulent white supremacy campaign.</p>

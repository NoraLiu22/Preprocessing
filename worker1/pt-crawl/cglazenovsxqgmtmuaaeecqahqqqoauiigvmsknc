<H2><A NAME="pre"></A>Presentation of Morlanwelz</H2>

<P>The municipality of Morlanwelz (-lz not pronounced; 18,723 inhabitants
on 1 January 2007; 2,026 ha) is located 10 km west of <A HREF="be-whtcr.html">Charleroi</A>. The municipality of Morlanwelz is made since 1976 of the former municipalities of Morlanwelz-Mariemont, Carni&egrave;res and Mont-Sainte-Aldegonde.</P>

<P><B>Morlanwelz</B> was already settled in the prehistoric times, as proved by three flint axes found there in the late XIXth century. In the Roman
times, Morlanwelz was crossed by the way, later known as Chauss&eacute;e
<A HREF="be-whtbh.html">Brunehaut</A>, linking Bavay to Maastricht and Cologne via <A HREF="be-vlitg.html">Tongeren</A>. In 1879, a Roman <I>villa</I> was found north of the road, as well as a tumulus.<BR>
The etymology of Morlanwelz is disputed. Whereas <I>-welz</I> alludes to wet
lowlands (a valley, a plain or a ford), the exact meaning of <I>morlan-</I>
remains conjectural. The ancient chroniclers have popularized a
probably wrong, early name of Mortuorum Vallis, the Deads' Valley,
recalling a bloody battle supposed to have taken place there in the
first century AD. In 1889, Petau de Maulette claimed that the Celtic
word <I>morlo</I> means "fossile coal" and recalls the very old history of
coal picking (since some veins outcrop) in the region.<BR>
The medieval history of Morlanwelz is not known in detail either. The
village was probably a free domain of
Trazegnies, which probably developed around a feudal fortress built
maybe in the IXth century. The village was located on the border of
Hainaut with <A HREF="be-whtfe.html">Fontaine-l'Ev&ecirc;que</A>, then fiercely disputed between the bishops of <A HREF="fr-59-ca.html">Cambrai</A> and <A HREF="be-wlglg.html">Li&egrave;ge</A>. It was ruled by the lords of <A HREF="be-whtlr.html">Le R&#x0153;ulx</A>
until the end of that lineage and then transferred to the County of
Flanders and incorporated to the Provostship of <A HREF="be-whtbi.html">Binche</A>.</P>

<P>In 1545, Maria of Hungary, Charles V's sister, then Governor of the Low
Countries for some 15 years, was granted the Provostship of Binche by
her brother. The architect Du Br&#x0153;ucq, from <A HREF="be-whtms.html">Mons</A>, built for her a Renaissance castle in Binche; in 1546-1547, she asked the same
architect to build a hunting lodge and a farm in Morlanwez, suppressing
the old fortress, already reported as ruined in 1443. The architect
kept only the donjon, which was used as a pigeon house and a jail, but
was eventually suppressed in the XVIIth century. Maria's lodge is the
origin of the Royal domain of Mariemont. A famous festival was given in
the castle in August 1549; it was reported that 20,000 took part to a
banquet and the simulated siege of the castle by "salvages", which were
"repelled" by troops commanded by Princes of Piedmont and Ligne. The
festival was considered as "the most picturesque and animated ever".
In 1554, Binche and Mariemont were raided and burnt down by the troops
of King of France Henri II; the castle was revamped but Charles and
Mary abdicated and went back to Spain in 1556, where they both died two
years later. During the reign of Philip II, the castle of Mariemont was
hardly inhabited and close to fall into ruins.</P>

<P>Coal had been picked up from outcrops and dug out in the park of
Mariemont since the XIV-XVth century. Charles V and his successors
prohibited further coal digging and wood picking in the park
to protect it, but illegal exploitation did not stop. The ban was aimed
at preventing the inhabitants of Morlanwelz to use the Governor's park
as a coal and wood supply. In 1738, however, the architect J.A.
Anneessens proposed a plan of coal exploitation in the park; nothing
was really done in spite of several studies and reports until Charles
of Lorraine was appointed Governor of the Low Countries. He built a
new castle in Mariemont in 1756 and started coal extraction in 1759. It
took seven years to reach an exploitable vein and in 1769 Charles of
Lorraine gave up because of a deficit of 30,584 guilders.<BR>
After the French conquest in 1794, the castle was burnt and the park
was sacked; quickly, several captains of industry competed for the
concession of the park, whose coal potential had not been forgotten. On
20 Messidor of the Year X (9 July 1802), Isidore Warocqu&eacute;, Charles
Duvivier, J.B. Hardempont, P.F. Tiberghien and Nicolas Warocqu&eacute;,
founders of the <I>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Mariemont</I>, were officially granted a
11,500-ha concession. Nicolas Warocqu&eacute; (d. 1835) became the executive
director of the colliery and increased it under the Dutch rule; he was
elected Mayor of Morlanwelz in 1805 and rebuilt in 1830 a castle in
the park, surrounded by a landscaped garden. His descendants increased
the family wealth so that the last of them, Raoul, died in 1917 as "the
richest man in Belgium". Nicolas' son, Abel Warocqu&eacute; (1805-1864)
invented the <I>warocqu&egrave;re</I>, a device that increased the safety and
efficiency of mining; he was fond of land speculation and art. His son
L&eacute;on Warocqu&eacute; (1831-1868) had a very sad personal life and contributed
to the social development of the village of Morlanwelz; he was fond of
tree cultivation and promoted practical classes in his domain's
orchards. His brother Arthur (1835-1880) succeeded him as the director
of the colliery; he followed the tracks of his brother, promoting
several philanthropic and workers' societies and transforming
Morlanwelz into a modern town. After his death in Brussels, his body
was brought back to Mariemont by a special train that stopped in the
middle of the colliery yard; all the streets were decorated with black
flags and the 6,000 miners were kneeling along the route of the
funerary convey. The last Warocqu&eacute;, Raoul, became one of he most famous art collectors in Belgium; he bequeathed the domain of Mariemont to the Belgian state. The castle was destroyed by a blaze in 1960 but the art
works were preserved and housed in a modern building. The <I>Mus&eacute;e Royal de Mariemont</I> is owned today by the <A HREF="be-fr.html">French Community</A>.</P>

<P>In 1740, Maria-Elisabeth, Governor of the Low Countries, decided to
create in Mariemont a spa, on the model of <A HREF="be-wlgsa.html">Spa</A>. She commissionned three professors from the <A HREF="be_catul.html">University of Leuven</A> to study the water of the fountains located near her castle. The professors acknowledged the
value of the waters and pointed out three sources: the Archduchess'
Fountain "for the kidney and bladder diseases", the Roidemont Fountain
"for the tuberculosis sufferers", and the Montaigu Fountain "for the
people in delicate health". The architect J.A. Anneessens drafted the
building of the new spa in 1741 and Doctor Delval, from Leuze, was
appointed director of the spa. The water should also be sold in
bottles. The unexpected death of Maria-Elisabeth in Mariemont in August
1741 did not stop the project, which was encouraged by Empress
Maria-Theresia. However, the War of Austrian Succession restricted the
funds allocated to the spa, which was much more modest than planned. To
advertize the spa, the director invited high rank nobles, the most
famous of them being Count of Calenberg, the son of the King of Poland
and Saxe Elector's Chamberlain; he stayed in 1743 in the royal castle
where he drank 4 liters of water per day. In 1741, 27 took the waters in
Mariemont; this number was increased to 57 in 1744, but the bottles did
not sell good. Delval claimed several miraculous healings, such as the
release of more than 3,000 worms within 18 days! After the return of
peace, the spa was revamped in 1748 and 1752, when Ministers were
invited to stay at Mariemont. However, the spa was not successful and
the sources dried out because of coal-mining. Delval was not appointed
a successor after his death and the Accounting Chamber proposed the
suppression of the position of surgeon, which was maintained by the
Governor. The spa did not survive the French Revolution.</P>

<P><B>Mont-Saint-Aldegonde</B> is located on the top of a hill, 190 m asl. Dame
Marie of Mont-Saint-Aldegonde was the mother of Philippe of Marnix
(1540-1598). Marnix studied in Leuven, D&ocirc;le and Padova, and, after his
conversion to the Reformed Religion, in Geneva. Back to the Low
Countries, he promoted the Reform and exiled to Emden during the rule
of the Duke of Alba. He wrote there his pamphlet <I>De Byencorf der H.
Roomsche Kercke</I> in 1569 and moved to Heidelberg, where he served the
Palatinate Elector Friedrich III. William of Nassau, Prince of Orange,
commissioned him for diplomatic, religious and military missions, for
instance the gathering of the exiled synode of the Reformed Churches of
the Low Countries in Emden in 1571. Marnix was captured and jailed by
the Spaniards, who allowed him to write a Dutch verse translation of
the Psalter. In 1583, he was appointed Premier Mayor of the Calvinist
Republic of Antwerp, besieged by Alexander Farnese. He capitulated in
1585 and retired in his castle of West-Souburg in Zeeland. Maurice of
Nassau called him back and sent him to Queen of England Elisabeth I
and King of France Henri IV, who appointed him <I>Conseillier du
Roy</I>. The synode asked him to translate the Bible in Dutch; he died
without having completed his work. Marnix is considered as the author
of the national Dutch anthem, <I>Het Wilhelmus</I>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="fla"></A>Municipal flag of Morlanwelz</H2>

<P>The municipal flag of Morlanwelz is horizontally divided yellow-red
with two interlaced, voided lozenges touching the upper and lower edges
of the flag, forming a red "M" letter inside the yellow stripe and a
yellow "W" letter inside the red stripe.<BR>
According to <I>Armoiries communales en Belgique. Communes wallonnes, bruxelloises et germanophones</I>, the flag follows the proposal made by
the Heraldry and Vexillology Council of the French Community as:<BR>
<I>Deux laizes longitudinales jaune et rouge avec deux grands losanges
&eacute;vid&eacute;s se prolongeant l'un dans l'autre, touchant les bords sup&eacute;rieur
et inf&eacute;rieur du tablier et formant la lettre capitale M en rouge et la
capitale W en jaune</I>.<BR>
The image in the source book erroneously shows the "W" in black.</P>

<P>Yellow and red are the <A HREF="be-wal.html">Walloon</A> colours. The flag is based on the emblem of the <A HREF="http://www.musee-mariemont.be/">Royal Museum of Mariemont</A>, a red square with a white "M" letter off-set and only partially shown so that it evokes also a
"W". The letter "M" recalls Morlanwelz, Mariemont and Mary of Hungary, whereas the letter "W" recalls Raoul Warocqu&eacute; and Wallonia.</P>

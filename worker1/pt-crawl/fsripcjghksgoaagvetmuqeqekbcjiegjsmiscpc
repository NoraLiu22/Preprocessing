<p>The municipality of Vitor Meireles (5,156 inhabitants in 2014; 37,156 ha) is 
located 270 km north-west of Florian�polis.<br><br>Vitor Meireles was settled in 
1935 as Rio Preso; this odd name (Stuck River) refers to the local geography, 
the river being &quot;stuck&quot; between ravines and forests. In 1945, the place was 
renamed to Alto Rio Dollmann, and, subsequently, to Forca�ao (Forked Junction), 
a reference to the fork formed by the confluence of rivers Fachinal and Palmitos.<br>
In 1967, the writer Alceste Moser proposed to the Municipal Chamber of Ibirama 
to change the name of Forca�ao to Vitor Meireles, as a tribute to the famous 
Santa Catarina-born painter Victor Meirelles (1832-1903)<br>The municipality of 
Vitor Meireles was established by State Law No. 7,579 promulgated on 26 April 
1989 and inaugurated on 1 January 1990.<br><br>The country's main reserve of 
araucarias is located in Vitor Mereiles, as an Area of Ecological Relevant 
Interest. Covering 4,604 ha, it forms one of the last remains of the Santa 
Catarina Atlantic rainforest, with more than 8,000 native Brazilian pines, some 
of them older than 200 years.<br><br>

<br>Leis Municipais database<br><br>The coat of arms of Vitor Meireles is 
prescribed by Municipal Law No. 37 promulgated on 23 April 1990.<br><br>Article 
1.<br>The municipal coat of arms is described as follows: Iberian shield 
surrounded by a red chain. On a white field, in the upper left canton, a black 
cogwheel surrounding, orled by a black circle, a factory with yellow windows and 
chimneys, with black outlines and furnace. In the shield's lower part, 
surrounded by a black semi-circle, a farmer holding a hoe in the foreground of a 
cultivated area, with black outlines and green, yellow and white background. The 
shield surmounted by green mountains under yellow sun rays. Beneath the shield a 
green scroll outlined in black inscribed in white &quot;VITOR MEIRELES&quot;, &quot;26-4&quot; and 
&quot;1989&quot;.<br><br>Article 2.<br>The heraldic elucidation is the following. The 
shield, of Iberian style,<br>is shaped like a semi-circle surrounded by a chain, 
representing the inhabitants' spirit of union. The scroll identifies the 
municipality's name and date of political emancipation. The mountains and the 
stylized sun rays represent the municipality's topography and promising future, 
through a spirit of hope, optimism and confidence in the prosperity of the 
municipality's horizon. The stylized araucarias represent forests and the timber 
extraction history, so connected to the municipality's past and present vocation 
and income. The stylized cogwheel and factory represent the municipality's 
dynamism and present and future vocation. The farmer, his hoe and the cultivated 
area represent the municipality's rural vocation and the integration of man with 
land, which, cultivated with care, force and dedication, supplies harvests, 
support and life.<br><br>

<P ALIGN="Justify"><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agonized over these sections.  Whether to ignore these flags and what they stand for, or include them was a tough decision.  I feared including them would constitute legitimizing them, and certainly didn't want to do that.  In the end I thought it important that they be identified for what they stood for, because many times they have been unknowingly displayed or incorrectly identified as historical by unsuspecting or uninformed individuals or flag companies.  
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are flags that many times &quot;migrate&quot; from group to group, many of which rapidly appear and disappear as they change their  names, and this makes identification even more difficult. Many of these groups were (and are very small) and don't exist any longer, but their flags continue to be used by other modern extremists.  Unfortunately, there are a number of people who, like Ayn Rand's characters in &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; think there is something wrong in the world, that the world isn't following the right value system.  As an alternative, they get into extremist politics like anarchism, environmentalism, neo-fascism, and radical traditionalism.  The scary part is that this page only identifies a small portion of the Flags of Extremism being sold today. The sad truth be known, any flag or cultural symbol's true meaning can be used, then distorted and eventually destroyed by their misuse by these extremists groups. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please be aware that in <B><U>NO WAY</U></B> does this site support the beliefs, policies, or philosophies of these organizations, nor encourage the displaying of these flags.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">November 17 took its name from the date of an uprising of a group of students at the Polytechnical School in Athens in 1973. The student uprising was crushed by the Greek Military Junta (1967-1974) led by Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos, who had seized dictatorial powers in the <I>coup d&acute;&eacute;tat</I> of 1967.  The 17-N group was founded in 1975, one year after the fall of the military junta. Their first act of terrorism was the assassination of Richard Welch, the head of the CIA bureau in Athens. Over 21 people were later added to the murder and kill list of 17-N, including American, British and Turkish diplomats as well as Greek policemen, businessmen and politicians.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The group was dismantled with the help of an international task force led by Scotland Yard in 2002. The leaders of the group were Alexandre Giotopoulos, arrested in 2002 on the Island of Lipsos, and Dimitris Koufondinas, known as &quot;the man with a thousand faces,&quot; who surrendered to police the same year.</P></TD>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1932, a right-wing Irish organization, first called the Army Comrades Association (ACA), then the National Guard, and eventually merged into the Fine Gael Party, was started by Thomas F. O'Higgins and &quot;General&quot; Eoin O'Duffy, who where the first two leaders. Because the membership wore &quot;St. Patrick&acute;s blue,&quot; (sky blue) shirts, they soon became more popularly known by their nickname of &quot;The Blueshirts.&quot;  The Blueshirts, at least on the surface, appeared to be the Irish equivalent of the German Brownshirts or Italian Blackshirts; they wore paramilitary-style uniforms, greeted each other with Roman salutes, and participated in street violence and fights, usually against the IRA.  Although they didn't seem to completely follow Fascist doctrine and didn't engage in political terrorism, the Blueshirts were declared an extremist and illegal organization by the Irish government.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After the banning in 1933, the National Guard has merged into the newly founded Fine Gael party, with O'Duffy as its first president who, after serious disagreements with other party leaders, resigned in 1934 and left to form the National Corporate Party, an openly Fascist organization nicknamed the &quot;Greenshirts&quot;, in 1935. Only a minority of former Blueshirts followed him; most of them remained in the Fine Gael, which soon distanced itself from the extremism and evolved into a modern party of the center-right, participating in several coalition governments, including the current one (2011-present). O'Duffy later led Irish volunteers to aid the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1937) and had contacts with the Third Reich until his death in 1944, but his &quot;Greenshirt&quot; party was defunct by the end of 1937. The actual flag the Greenshirts used is currently unknown, although one undocumented source indicates they simply used the traditional Saint Patrick's Cross/Saltire Flag.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Blueshirts&acute; flag, later also used briefly by the Fine Gael Party, was charged with the red saltire of St. Patrick on a field of light sky blue, the same color as used on the Blueshirts&acute; uniforms.  Contemporary black and white photos clearly show flags with dark saltire on a light field that match their shirts, which were worn with dark ties, trousers and caps. The surviving Blueshirts' uniforms confirm the use of the light sky blue.</P><A NAME="anarchist"></A></TD>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Antifaschistische Aktion, an umbrella organization for militant anti-fascists in Germany, was formed in 1932. It was sometimes called "Antifa". Although it did not survive the war, local anti-fascist committees were formed across Germany, typically by veterans of this organization, as Nazi rule crumbled in 1944, under the name "Antifa".[1] These anti-fascist committees often included communists, social democrats, and progressive Christians.[2] </p>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> The modern Germany movement most commonly associated with anti-fascism originated in the late 1980s, growing out of West Germany's squatter scene and autonomism movement.[5] This movement ultimately has its origins in the student-based Au&szlig;erparlamentarische Opposition and the values associated with the new social movements. Unlike the 1930s Antifaschistische Aktion, which was linked to the Communist Party of Germany, concerned with industrial working-class politics against Hitler's NSDAP, the late 1980s and early 1990s "autonomists" were instead independent "anti-authoritarian" Libertarian Marxists and anarcho-communists, not associated with any particular party. 

It was after German reunification in 1990, that most of the Antifa groups were formed.</p>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Legionary Action, popularly referred to as &quot;The Black Shirts,&quot; is a fascist political organization in Peru founded on January 5, 2013. They trace their beginnings back to 1931 and the founding of the Revolutionary Union, a Peruvian political party founded by Luis Miguel S&agrave;nchez Cerro, the Brigade General of the Army of Peru. After Cerro's death it was led by Luis Alberto Flores Medina who has continued to followed Cerro's political philosophy. The modern AL's leaders include Lucio Rovegno, the paramount chief and highest authority of the organization and Enzo Fernandez Ciotola, who is the National leader of the Section of Press and Propaganda of Legionary Action.</p>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The AL is characterized by its opposition to liberalism and communism, and regards the current government as decadent and corrupt. Under the slogan &quot;neither left nor right&quot;, they support &quot;Peruvian fascism&quot; (National Corporatism), which is a political, economic and social doctrine that seeks to &quot;...rebuild the nationality through a social discipline and spiritual awareness, the harmonization of social classes and the corporate organization of the State.&quot; (i.e. a Fascist Dictatorship)</p>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There seem to be three different flags used by the <i>Acci&oacute;n Legionaria</i> at their public demonstrations:</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Alternative for Germany (Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland, AfD) is a right-wing political party in Germany, founded in February of 2013 by Bernd Lucke, Frauke Petry and Konrad Adam.  In the same year the AfD founded a youth organization called the &quot;Young Alternative for Germany&quot; (<i>Junge Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland</i> or JA), although not closely associating with its activities.  The AfD is added to these extremist pages as a good example of how a right-wing political movement can become associated with extremist views and policies.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Afd began as a center-right conservative party of the middle class supporting a mild  Euroscepticism (opposition to the European Union), against Germany using the Euro currency, against any economic bail out for countries such as Greece, and were opposed gay marriage.  However the party soon became a magnet that attracted extremist, such as former members of National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), and saw a shift to the extreme right with focus on issues such as anti-migration, Islam and strengthening ties to Russia. In May of 2015, Lucke and his followers left to found a new party, the Alliance for Progress and Renewal, citing the rise of xenophobic and pro-Russian sentiments in the party as the reason. After months of factional infighting Frauke Petry became the principal speaker. </P> 
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 2016, Petry suggested several times in public shooting refugees at the borders to Germany and the AfD has since adopted a policy platform based upon opposition to Islam, calling for the ban of all Islamic symbols including burkhas, minarets and the call to prayer, using the slogan &quot;Islam is not a part of Germany&quot;. Other party leadership has been guity of posting anti-Semitic comments on Facebook, and has been closely associated with PEGIDA (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West).  The AfD's voiced desire to break with consensus-based politics and opposion to using politically correct terminology (claiming it undermines freedom of speech), does make it seem like much of the party has become a mouthpiece for right-wing populism in Germany.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In March of 2016, a NSDAP-style banner was displayed by the party in Magdeburg, and although unofficial, it has not helped the AfD's overall image.  Their blue and white official Party Flag does appear far less extremist in nature.</P>

The term &quot;anarchism&quot; is basically used by people who want to abolish the government, abolish capitalism, abolish violence, abolish technology, abolish large-scale production, or abolish as existing society as whole. They seek to overturn, by violence if necessary, all constituted forms and institutions of society and government, with no plans for establishing any other system of order in the place of that destroyed. Basically, an anarchist is a person who promotes disorder or revolt against any established rule, law, or custom.</P>

Within these divergent groups there are a multitude of views on property and labor relations that differ significantly, and while many consider themselves simply anti-capitalists and oppose private ownership of the means of production, others stress the necessity of protecting private property, describing this as an integral component of individual rights and a free market economy. In short, there seems to be little agreement among the groups about what happens when government ceases to exist, nor the means of accomplishing it.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Anti-Communist Action (&quot;Anticom&quot; for short) is a neo-Nazi group who attempts to represent themselves as not being neo-Nazi, but their philosophy is generally indistinguishable from various other white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations. </p>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The group name is an inversion of Anti-Racist Action (ARA), historically the largest network of anti-racist and anti-fascist dedicated to confronting the far-right and disrupting their events and rallies in the world. However, the main purpose of Anticom seems quite the oposite, as they serve as an &quot;anti-communist&quot; front for the wider internet-based neo-Nazi movement.  They encourage confronting the far-left and disrupting their events and rallies through direct action, including violence. On the Discord servers they seem to associate themselves closely with groups like Vanguard America, the TWP, and Identity Europa.  As part of the broader white nationalist Alt-Right Movement, Anticom members were a visible presence at the nationally televised Charlottesville Riots of 2017.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The black and yellow colors used on their flags are those of libertarianism and is reminiscent of various Imperial German era flags.  A variation of this flag (type #2) features a Hughes 500 helicopter dropping a figure from the sky, a reference to brutal tactics of suppressing dissent used by Augusto Pinochet. The falling person that appears in the logo, actually depicts a &quot;death flight&quot; which was a form of killing practised by South American military forces where victims were dropped to their death from airplanes or helicopters.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A third variant of the Anti-Communist Action Flag places a new version of their Anticom logo centered on a yellow field. A stylized black and gold stars and stripes is the main design featured on this new logo, circled in black with the words Anti-Communist Action in white block letters.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A variant of the Anti-Communist Action Flag (type #4) features in the logo a version of the twin flags with a silhouette of a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, a more modern helicopter than the Hughes 500 used in the earlier flag (type #2), but still based on the same brutal tactics of execution of rivals. This bed sheet version (logo centered on a plain white flag) of the Anticom flag is similar in general design to that used by such extreme-leftist opposition groups as the <A HREF="#fr-afa">Anti-Fascist Action</A> in France and other similar groups in Europe.</P></TD>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The German American Bund (AV), or &quot;German American Federation,&quot; was a pre-World War II American Nazi organization active in New York between 1936-1939, whose roots can be found in the earlier Teutonia Club (1924-1933) and in the FDND (&quot;Friends of New Germany&quot; - <I>Freunde Des Neue Deutschland</I>) movement between 1933-1936.  An internal power struggle fought for control over the Friends in 1934 resulted in Heinz Spankn&ouml;bel, Alter K&auml;mpfer, and Fritz Julius Kuhn starting the new German American Bund in Buffalo, New York.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Bund established training camps in New Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin. Fritz Julius Kuhn was named Bund Leader (<I>Bundesf&ucirc;hrer</I>), and under his leadership the Bund held rallies complete with Nazi insignia, emblems and rituals.  They vocally attacked and held demonstrations against Jews, Communist, trade unions and the Roosevelt administration. In the process they claimed their main goal was to promote a favorable view of Nazi Germany. However, the Bund received no financial or verbal support from Germany, and in 1938, the Nazi government actually declared that no Nazi emblems could be used by the organization.  This was done to distance Germany from the Bund which had become an embarrassment to the then current German government policies with some of its rhetoric and actions.  Naturally, the AV's public activities pretty well ended with the declaration of war against Nazi Germany in December of 1941.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The first two Bund flags shown here were seen at German-American Bund activities in New Jersey and in New York City.  The second flag seems to have been modeled after German military flags. Naturally, there were also large displays of both the Stars and Stripes and the NSDAP Swastika flag displayed at AV events.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The activities of the German-American Bund included several Bund Youth Groups, or DJ (<I>Jugendschaft</I>), who had (assumed) unit flags on black fields mirroring the German Youth Troop flags (<I>Fahnleinfahne</I>). These unit flags were of simple design and consisted of a single runic &quot;S&quot; thunderbolt on a black background.  (The assumption they were unit colors is based on the fact that this flag many times had unit numbers inscribed in red in the canton) The second type of Bund Youth Group flag consisted of a white runic &quot;S&quot; thunderbolt centered on the black field, surrounded by a white circle which was centered on a white cross.  This elongated banner seemed to have served the purpose of a general <I>Bund Jugendschaft</I>, or house flag, since no unit designations were present.</P><A NAME="awb"></A></TD>

After World War II, the &quot;Three Sevens&quot; version of the <I>triskele</I> was popularized by white supremacists in Europe and South Africa.  The symbol is also used as part of the logo of the international racist skinhead group, &quot;Blood &amp; Honour.&quot;</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The <I>Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging</I> (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) or AWB, is a far right political organization and former paramilitary group in South Africa under the leadership of Eug&Atilde;&fnof;&Acirc;&uml;ne Terre'Blanche. The AWB claims that the three sevens symbolized supremacy over the devil. They are committed to the restoration of an independent Boere-Afrikaner republic or &quot;<I>Boerestaat</I>&quot; within South Africa. In their heyday they received much publicity both in South Africa and abroad as an extremist white supremacist group.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The AWB Flag (Type #2) was introduced in 1979, but was withdrawn from official use after a short time in favor of already well-established flag with three 7's. The star was said to have represented the Star of Bethlehem, and the Christianity in general. The flag with three 7's (Type #1) was the original flag of the movement; although it was replaced with the flag charged with the stars and letters AW in 1979, it was reintroduced in same year and used ever since. The flag was designed by Jan Groenewald, one of the founders of the movement, and slightly modified by Dries Albert, who was in charge
 of the movement's propaganda.</P> 
 	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">According to Groenewald himself, the inspiration for the design did come from the Nazi flag, however, the three digits were always described as a Christian symbol, the number 777 having been described as the biblical symbol of perfection and of God himself, as opposed to the number 666 which symbolizes the Antichrist. 
 	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">According to Groenewald, the color red on the flag stood for blood, white stood for the purity of the White race, and black stood for bravery.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The American Nazi Party, founded by George Lincoln Rockwell in 1959 and led by him until his death, had a flag like that of Nazi Germany with a small blue globe in the center of the swastika, representing the world being consumed by the swastika. The depiction of the globe on party flag and emblem varied: sometimes it was showing only the North America and some of neighboring regions, but it was sometimes also showing all continents, together with the meridians and parallels as in the current United Nations flag, and there were few of its depictions as in the original United Nations flag.  On many occasions, the globe was simplified to a blank solid blue circle, as can be seen in some early color photographs. Rockwell initially called his party the &quot;World Union of Free Enterprise National Socialists&quot; (WUFENS), but later renamed it the American Nazi Party in 1960 to attract maximum media attention. The party, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, largely based its platform upon the ideals and policies of Adolf Hitler's NSDAP, but added a policy of Holocaust denial, and expressed allegiance to the Constitutional principles of the American Founding Fathers.</p>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In a "Keep the Redskins White!" demonstration members of the American Nazi Party demonstrated against desegregating the Washington Redskins football team in October of 1961. At the time the Washington DC pro-football team was the last remaining all-white team in the league, and although desegregated today, it remains the only team in the NFL whose name is considered a racial slur.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1965, Rockwell ran for the governor of Virginia, finishing last among the four candidates. Although the ANP had already existed for six years, he ran as an independent candidate, probably in order to make himself more acceptable to the voters, and used a flag in his campaign which was derived from the Confederate flag by replacing the stars with the words ROCKWELL GOVERNOR in white. The flag was actually made from a real Confederate flag on which the stars were painted into blue before the letters were added.
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1967, Rockwell was killed by John Patler, a former party member whom Rockwell had ejected from the party for allegedly trying to introduce Marxist doctrine into the party's platforms. The ANP name was changed to the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP) in 1967 shortly before Rockwell's assassination.  In 1969 a youth wing of the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP) was formed by Joseph Tommasi called the <a href="hate2.html#nslf">National Socialist Liberation Front</a>.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The so-called Bicentennial Flag of the National Socialist White Peoples Party was first seen in a demonstration in 1976 on the Fourth of July outside the White house. The NSWPP party claimed the flag celebrated America's Bicentennial and had nothing to do with any bicentennial of the National Socialist Movement which, of course, began in 1919. The red-white-blue Bicentennial flag was designed by Matt Koehl, the current leader of both the New Order and the World Union of National Socialists (WUNS).  Koehl has a long history of being in leadership positions in various extremist groups, including the National Renaissance Party (NRP), the United White Party (UWP), the National States' Rights Party (NSRP), and the American Nazi Party (ANP). In August 1967, Koehl succeeded the George Lincoln Rockwell as &quot;Commander&quot; of the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP), and renamed it the <A HREF="hate2.html#usno">&quot;New Order&quot;</A> in 1983. By then, several splits resulted in formation of new neo-Nazi groups, mostly due to Koehl's policies, based on his vision of Nazism as a religious movement rather than a political one. Since mid-1980s, the New Order has been headquartered in New Berlin, Wisconsin, preaching Nazism as a pseudo-religion, without any public political activities.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> Today, the name &quot;American Nazi Party&quot; has been adopted by an organization led by Rocky J. Suhayda, a former member of Rockwell's original party in 1960s,  and headquartered in Westland, Michigan.  Rocky Suhayda was later affiliated with a group in Detroit called the SS Action Group led By Ted Dunn in the 1980s. Dunn ran a kind of a soup kitchen operation feeding those who &quot;fought&quot; under his leadership. The new group claims George Lincoln Rockwell as their founder, but there seems no actual connection to the original ANP, apart from the fact that their website sells nostalgic reprints of Rockwell's 1960s-era magazine &quot;The Stormtrooper&quot; and replica flags of the original party.</P>  
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The new American Nazi Party uses a version of the original ANP Flag (shown top left, with blue UN-style globe) on their website and a vertical banner (shown left) at their rallies. However, a few years ago, they sold flags of various countries and states with a swastika superimposed on their designs, including the 13-star United States flag shown on the left.</P></TD>

In 2006, ISIS, acting as an umbrella organization for the Iraqi insurgent groups started by al-Qaida supporters and members, and taking advantage of the weakness of the states of Iraq and Syria following the Iraq Wars, managed to seize a fairly large portion of the area. What followed was a senseless regime of terror and destruction, resulting in the deaths of thousands of innocent people and the desecration of many irreplaceable historical monuments. Massive amounts of Syrians and Iraqi fled the war torn area resulting in a world wide refugee crisis.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The reoccurring appearance of <a href="protest3.html#all-white">all-white Stars and Stripes</A> seems to have eventually inspired the introduction of a similar all-black flag. Seen from any distance, it may look like a plain black field with no design at all but when moving in the breeze, the observer can make out heavy stitches which outline the stripes, as well as the stars embroidered on the canton, all looking &quot;blacker than black&quot;.</P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A recent surge of popularity prompted a number of online shops to include the flag in their offer. It is especially favored by the ultra-rightists, who claim that the Confederate units in the Civil War used all-black flags to indicate that they would never surrender - the opposite of the white flags. This story was soon expanded to claim that those were the &quot;no quarter&quot; flags, signifying that no prisoners would be taken, the enemies being killed instead - closer to the original meaning of all-black flags, which had signified the piracy long before the Civil War. This flag thus reflects the growing hostility of American ultra-rightists towards everyone who does not share their beliefs, openly speaking of resorting to violence, even about an approaching &quot;second Civil War&quot;.</P></TD>

In the early 60s, the Black Muslims were very active and violent extremist. In fact, Middle East Muslims rejected the American Black Muslim version of Islam, which was pretty much just a hate the white man movement.  Malcolm X, perhaps their most well-known leader, eventually abandoned many of these violent ideas and converted to true Sunni Islam. Because of this, he was gunned down in a mosque by two black men wielding shotguns.</P>

The star is oriented with two points inside the crescent.  The symbols of the sun, moon, and the stars, represent the universe. The flag differs slightly from their logo which has the individual letters &quot;F, J, E, and I&quot; placed in the four corners.

Active all through the 1970s, the group collapsed as a cohesive group in early 1980s, but remnants have managed to survive until the present time. Its flag is blue, charged with a red sun cross, or &quot;sunwheel&quot;, on a white disc. Blue armbands with the same design were used.  This flag has occasionally seen more recent use by the British National Party (BNP).</p>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The BM also used a ceremonial flag, or banner, which they called the &quot;Honour Standard&quot. It was charged with a white inscription BRITAIN (above) and another white inscription AWAKE (beneath) the sunwheel, and it had a white fringe. It was usually flown from a staff with the crossbar. A sunwheel style finial and name plate with the initials BM were usually mounted above the banner. Sometimes another similar name plate was attached beneath on the staff.  It was, of course, designed to be similar to the ceremonial banner used by the German National Socialist Movement (NSDAP) and helped identify the British Movement with its German predecessor. This ceremonial design was also used on hand-held flags.</p>

The organization initially claimed to be protecting the African American neighborhoods from police brutality, but the leaders soon claimed to be followed Socialist and Maoist Communist doctrines.

Construction of a planned cult center for the German SS forces was planned there by Heinrich Himmler, but never completed.  It is not known whether or not the mosaic was placed on the floor during the work on the hall between 1938-1943, or if it was there previously.  Some scholars have tried to trace it back to the late Roman and early medieval periods, but this all remains speculation.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The symbol has, however, been adopted by neo-Nazi groups and placed on a variety of flags.  The name <em>Schwarze Sonne</em> (Black Sun) came into use after World War II. It is not known what the original Nazis occult name for the symbol was or what it actually stood for.  It was especially promoted by Miguel Serrano, an esoteric neo-Nazi writer from Chile, as the symbol of an invisible source of spiritual energy which would repurify the blood of Aryans and bring on a new Golden Age. Serrano claimed that Aryans were descendants of extragalactic beings called Hyperboreans and they could restore their &quot;blood-memory&quot; in the light of the &quot;Black Sun.&quot;</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 2016, the symbol colored in red also appeared on a flag with a black field. The flag  was square, or nearly square, and photographed in Roussillon, France, most likely used by members of the French Nationalist Party (Also see <a href="#fnp">Irminsul Symbol</a> on this page).

In the late 1980s, the group was broken up by mass arrests and then slowly faded into insignificance as the leadership turned on each other.</P></TD>

The BWB was initially led by Eddie von Maltitz and subsequently by Andrew Ford. This flag and its symbol are now also being used by European Nazis as they have volunteered to fight in a race war in South Africa.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The group appeared either to have gone underground or had ceased to exist, because their public activities were curtailed after 1999, but a new website has appeared in 2012.  Until the appearance of this new website, their last public activity as the Boer Resistance Movement was when they offered to send a force of 35 volunteer soldiers to Yugoslavia in 1999 to help defend Serbia against &quot;NATO aggression.&quot; It is unknown if anything ever came of this offer.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Their current BWB flag, which is featured on their website, has a cross composed of five black letters, four B's and one W, arranged on the white disc so as to give the abbreviation BWB both horizontally and vertically. The white cross is described as the symbol of faith and purity, its red borders as the symbol of both the blood Christ shed on the cross and the blood Boer people shed in struggle for freedom, and the black field as the symbol of courage and determination of Boer people.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">How viable this new rebirth of the BWB is cannot yet be determined, but the website seems to be a serious recruitment effort.  On their website they state they hope to bring the Boer nation together, and point to the current South African government as &quot;a sadistic and racist regime&quot; that must be stopped, stating their main goal is to free the three Boer republics (Transvaal, North Natal, Free State) from the &quot;Afrikaner betrayal.&quot;</P></TD>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Christian Falangist Party of America (CFPA) was founded in Philadelphia in 2000 to replace the National Syndical American Falangist Party (NSAFP). They claimed to be dedicated &quot;to fighting the &quot;Forces of Darkness&quot; which seek to destroy all of Western Judeo-Christian Civilization.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This new Falangist organization claimed that they no longer would condone acts of violence or hatred towards those of differing or opposing viewpoints and lifestyles, and they would no longer tolerate racism or anti-Semitism among their membership in any form. They severed their former ties to the Spanish Falange and all other &quot;neo-Nazi/anti-Democratic/third position groups&quot; who used the name Falange or Falangist. Instead of claiming succession from the NSAFP, they claimed to have derived their name from the Lebanese Falange, one of the oldest and strongest Christian parties from Lebanon, which, in fact, were originally modeled after the Spanish Falange, but gradually got rid of the Fascist &quot;appearance&quot; through the years, although its members still use a form of Roman salute. This new Christian Falangist Party claimed they believed only in the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Holy Bible. They supported the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and nationalistic loyalty to the United States of America. Unfortunately, in practice, it soon turned out to be business as usual.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The original party flag was charged with a blue &quot;Battle Cross&quot; within a red ring, all on white field. The cross was derived from a similar one which was used by the Lebanese Forces, a former militia and current political party of Lebanese Christians, which was also partly modeled after the Lebanese Falange (borrowed their form of Roman salute, etc.). In 2003, The &quot;Battle Cross&quot; was replaced with a crutch-cross. This emblem was derived from that of the Fatherland Front (Austria 1934-1938), whose ideology was known as the Austro-Fascism, but although it was authoritarian and corporativist, it was generally less oppressive than most similar contemporary European regimes. It certainly was anti-Nazi and opposed the <I>Anschluss</I>; their first leader, Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, was killed by the Austrian Nazis during an unsuccessful coup in 1934 and his successor, Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, was sent to a concentration camp after the <I>Anschluss</I>. After the war, Schuschnigg moved to the USA and became a US citizen and the professor of Political Science at Saint Louis University. The Christian Integralist and anti-Nazi ideology of the Fatherland Front was chosen by the CFPA to be their new source of inspiration.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It should be pointed out here that the Crutch Cross a simplified version of the &quot;Jerusalem Cross,&quot; or the &quot;Crusader's Cross.&quot;  They are a heraldic cross and a Christian symbol consisting of a large Greek cross surrounded by four smaller Greek crosses, one in each quadrant. They, like many other historical symbols, have been commandeered by extremist groups in an attempt to legitimize their existence. The Jerusalem Cross is also used on the flag of Georgia.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Along with the Fatherland Front, the Lebanese Falange remained the model for the CFPA and an alternative party flag was introduced after 2003, using a stylized tree like the cedar of the Lebanese Falangists, but striped in red and blue on white field so as to display the US national colors. The &quot;Battle Cross&quot; has reappeared, in a slightly modified form and painted in red, on white flag of the &quot;Christian Forces&quot;, a would-be militia or social organization which seems to never have been really operative (which makes it difficult to decide about their real nature), although an address was reserved for their planned website which never appeared, only their flag having been regularly presented along with the party flags. A rarely used variant of the official party flag was introduced in 2007, with much darker shades of blue and red and charged with the party name inscribed in white over the ring.</P>

The symbol is designed so as to resemble the 1935-1940 emblem of the British Union of Fascists and the meaning is also similar, with the ring standing for the unity in a collective and the lightning flash standing for the action. Since the Student Bloc is actually the student wing of CasaPound, its members frequently carry both flags together.</p><A NAME="cpo"></A></TD>

		<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here is a flag with a long history that proves the rule, "one man's extremist is another man's patriot." In Serbia this flag served as a resistance flag against the World War II German occupation, but now has been opted by extremist groups and others to serve very different purposes. The <I>Chetniks</I> (Troopers) were originally guerrilla groups which, since 1903, operated in areas still under the Ottoman rule, fighting not only against the Ottoman Empire, but also against similar Bulgarian groups. They also participated in the Balkan Wars (1912-1913) alongside the regular army, and again in World War I, in parts of Serbia which were occupied and annexed by Bulgaria (1915-1918). Along with Serbian national flags, they used black flags with skull and crossbones and inscriptions like <I>Sloboda ili smrt</I> (Freedom or Death). (Similar flags were also used in the Macedonian uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1903.)</P> 
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In World War II and afterwards, the Chetnik flag came to be used by anti-Communist resistance fighters. Thanks largely to Communist propaganda against the Chetniks in Serbia they were labeled extremist. The name Chetniks also became a name used by various legitimate para-military groups in the bloody Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, but unfortunately, also became a name used by groups of local thugs and criminals hiding under the name in order to get some impunity for their actions. Naturally this Communist over-propagandizing of the name also resulted in making the flag popular among various other groups, some of whom were extremists, some not, some merely patriotic, and some who were just plain thugs. In Serbia today it is sometimes hard to determine which was which.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The original World War II Chetnik flags usually had the inscription <I>S verom u Boga</I> (With Faith in God) and <I>Za kralja i otadÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾binu</I> (For King and Fatherland), sometimes with places switched, because &quot;For King and Fatherland&quot; and &quot;With Faith in God&quot; had been inscribed on Serbian military colors until 1918. Two of the flags (Type #1 and #2) shown here were used during the Yugoslav Wars. The inscriptions at the top are <I>S verom u Boga</I> (With Faith in God) and <I>Za Kralja i OtadÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾binu</I> (For King and Fatherland), respectively, and <I>Sloboda ili smrt</I> (Freedom or Death) at the bottom. Variants of these flags, with differing text, are still also used freely by Serbian anti-Communist emigrants in Western countries as the symbol of a non-Communist resistance movement. The Type #3 variant is being sold, but its use is questionable, and has not been seen or documented in Serbia. <A NAME="hutaree"></A></P></TD>

The present-day party was founded in 1933 by the Revolutionary Workers' Groups as the CPI.  In the early 1940s the party was disbanded in Ireland, but continued in Northern Ireland as the Communist Party of Northern Ireland.  The party was re-established in the South in 1948 under the name Irish Workers' League, which changed its name in 1962 to Irish Workers' Party. The two sections reunited as the Communist Party of Ireland in 1970.  While it is a registered party, the CPI has rarely run candidates in elections and has never had any electoral success.</p>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Communist Party of Ireland claims its goal is to end the capitalist system and replace it with socialist state that would control all means of production, distribution and exchange, which would be &quot;publicly owned and utilized for the benefit of the whole people.&quot; It is actively opposed to &quot;neo-liberalism&quot; and to the European Union.</P>

Aside from mass protests the movement was active in organizing public pressure to support ethnic Russians in number of high profile court cases involving crimes committed by the immigrants.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The term <I>Falange</I> is used by several political movements and parties dating from the 1930s, including the original Fascist movement in Spain. The word &quot;Falange&quot; actually means &quot;phalanx,&quot; (a Macedonian or Spartan Greek military formation) in Spanish, and there are many small parties still calling themselves the <I>Falange</I> Party today.  The warlike symbol of the phalanx was chosen due to the militaristic nature of these National Socialist type parties. It should be noted here that the yoke and the arrows both were taken from the Catholic King's emblems (the yoke for Ferdinand of Aragon and the arrows for Elizabeth of Castile) and the same symbols were readopted by Franco's regime.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The original Spanish <I>Falange</I> movement was founded in 1933 by JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Antonio Primo de Rivera, who was the son of the former Spanish dictator, General Primo de Rivera. Their platform (political agenda) combined the national traditions of Spain with these of Fascist ideology.</P> 
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The <I>Falange</I> symbol was also used in World War II on a flag used by the soldiers of the <I>Divisio'n Azul</I> (Blue Division), a Spanish volunteer unit in the German Army which fought on the Eastern Front. It was formed in 1941, and was disbanded 1943. Theirs was certainly not the only case of using of a flag with this design: there have been many flags with the <I>Falange</I> symbol on them.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Today, decades after the fall of the Franco Fascist dictatorship, Spain still has several minor Falangist organizations, represented by a number of tiny political parties. Chief among these are the <I>Falange EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ola</I> (<I>de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacionalsindicalista</I>), <I>Falange EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ola de las JONS</I>, <I>Falange AutÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ntica</I>, <I>Falange EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ola Independiente</I>, and <I>FE - La Falange</I>. </P> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Following post-Francoist Spanish Falanges is a bit confusing, with their splitting and merging and use of similar names which have even led to several lawsuits. These fascist inspired parties are rarely seen publicly except on the ballots, in State funded TV election advertisements, and during demonstrations on historic dates, such as November 20 celebration the death of both Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera and General Francisco Franco. For example, in the 2004 national elections, these parties combined received less than 28,000 votes between all of them.</P></TD>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Iron Guard was an ultra-nationalist, fascist, anti-communist, and extremist Orthodox Christian movement originally founded by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, an anti-Semitic professor at the Bucharest University in 1927.  Originally known as &quot;The Legion of the Archangel Michael&quot; (<I>Legiunea Arhanghelului Mihail</I>), then renamed the &quot;Everything for the Country&quot; (<I>Totul pentru Tara</I>) Party, and the &quot;The Legionnaire Movement&quot; (<I>"Miscarea legionara</I>), but the name most commonly given to this far-right Romanian movement and political party was &quot;The Iron Guard.&quot;</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Its members wore green uniforms, thus were sometimes called &quot;Greenshirts&quot; (<I>Camasile verzi</I>), and greeted each other using the Fascist Roman salute. The main symbol used by the Iron Guard was a triple cross, standing for the prison bars of martyrdom, and sometimes referred to as the &quot;Archangel Michael Cross&quot; (<I>Crucea Arhanghelului Mihail</I>).</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Iron Guard differed from other fascist movements because its membership,  rather than the usual military veterans, came from the peasantry and students. However, the legionnaires shared the fascist love for violence and political assassinations. The black flag of the movement, with its swastika in a white circle, soon became well-known in Romania in the late 20s and the early 30s. It was originally used by the National Christian Party, a similar although less militant party, in whose founding Codreanu took part in 1923 before having broken away to found the Iron Guard.  (A tricolor with the swastika was used later by the National Christian Defense League and the <A HREF="hate3.html#pnc">National Christian Party</A>) After 1938, the swastika symbol was replaced by the triple cross and the black field on their flags was normally replaced with a green, but occasionally a red one.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The movement took part in the Spanish Civil War, and they had two prominent martyrs, both close to Codreanu, who died in the battle of Majadahonda. In 1938, when Codreanu was assassinated after the Guard started its conflict with King Carol (Charles) II over his plans to convert the country into a fascist nation. A campaign of assassinations ensued by Guard &quot;legionnaires&quot; who formed death squads and even though they managed to kill the prime-minister, they were almost decimated in the process.  The black grid flag was completely banned by the Antonescu regime in 1941 and the new Guard leader, Horia Sima (Codreanu's successor), was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp.  He was released in 1944, became the head of the Romanian government in exile until 1945, but was never allowed to returned from exile and died in Spain.</P>

It ceased to exist as the separate organization in 2005, merging with the <I>Patriotiki Symmahia</I> (Patriotic Alliance), which used different symbols. In 2007, the Patriotic Alliance ceased to exist and the Golden Dawn announced its re-activation (and reintroduction of the meander and sun wheel).

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The HDJ emerged from the &quot;League of Youth Loyal to the Homeland - Free League&quot; (<EM>Bund Heimattreuer Jugend - Freibund</EM>), an organization originating in late 1950s that was based on the traditions of early 20th-century German youth movements, and co-operated closely with the Viking Youth and other neo-Nazi organizations until the late 1980s when it began distancing from them, causing its most extreme members to break away in 1990 and found &quot;The Youth Loyal to the Homeland&quot; (<EM>Die Heimattreue Jugend</EM>), renamed the HDJ in 2000.</P>

The HDJ website claimed it fought &quot;for an independent Germany, for traditional values and for a lifestyle reflected in a healthy body, spirit and character. It also [fought] the use of English in the German mother tongue.&quot; Its newspaper &quot;Firebrand&quot; (<EM>Funkenflug</EM>) had a subtitle &quot;Young, Stormy, Loyal to the People.&quot;</P>
   	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since it is illegal to display Nazi symbols in Germany, the HDJ&acute;s flag features a stylized campfire,  but maintains the traditional national socialist colors of red, black and white.

Their goal is to see Europe "liberated from the enemy within and the enemy without." Lowell's beliefs were first published in an article, titled "Our Age", published in The Times of Malta in 1981.

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">National Christian Defense League was founded in 1923, by transformation of the National Christian Union <I>(Uniunea National Crestina)</I>, which was founded previous year. Founder and leader of both parties was Alexandru C. Cuza, a politician already known after his extreme anti-Semitism, in service of which he was using even the proposals that would otherwise sound progressive for those times, like universal male suffrage and land reform. Second position in the new party was held by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, whose political mentor Cuza was during previous years. The flag of National Christian Defense League was black with a white disc charged with a black swastika, all within a border in national colors. According to Codreanu, black field was the symbol of mourning, white disc symbolized the &quot;hopes surrounded by the darkness they will have to conquer&quot;, while the swastika was adopted as the worldwide symbol of anti-Semitism. The last statement suggests that the symbol was actually borrowed from the Nazis of Germany, although Cuza later claimed that it was used in Romania since 1910, when he took part in founding of the Democratic Nationalist Party <I>(Partidul Nationalist Democrat)</I>, from which he later broke away to found the National Christian Union, the party whose use of the swastika is indeed verified.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although the National Christian Defense League drew inspiration from Italian Fascism and German Nazism, it was not as militant as these movements and Cuza was constantly refusing Codreanu's proposals to turn the party into a militia. This eventually caused a split in 1927, when Codreanu broke away to found the Iron Guard. New movement quickly took many supporters from the National Christian Defense League, which managed to survive, although somewhat weakened, until 1935, when it merged with the National Agrarian Party <I>(Partidul National Agrar)</I> to form the <A HREF="hate3.html#pnc">National Christian Party</A> <I>(Partidul National Crestin)</I>. Some time after the split, the National Christian Defense League adopted a new flag, Romanian tricolor with a black swastika in the center, which it transferred to its successor in 1935.</P></TD>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Lithuanian National Union, founded 2011, is the most current neo-Nazi party in Lithuania. It is the successor of a host of previous neo-Nazi organizations. To name a few:
<UL>
<LI>Lithuanian Union of National Socialist Unity (LNSVS) - <I>Lietuviu` Nacionalsocialine's Vienybe's Sa`junga</I> (1996-1999)</LI>
<LI>Lithuanian National Democratic Party (LNDP) - <I>Lietuvos Nacionaldemokratu` Partija</I> (founded independently 1999-2009)</LI>

<LI>Lithuanian National Socialist Party (LNSP) <I>Lietuviu` Nacionalsocialine' Partija</I> (2000-2001)</LI>
<LI>Unified Lithuanian National Workers Movement (VLNDS) - <I>Vieningasis Lietuviu` Nacionaldarbininku` Sa`ju^dis</I> (2007-2011)</LI>
</UL>
All of these organizations, except the LNDP, were founded and led by the same man, Lithuanian neo-Nazi activist Mindaugas Murza (also known as Mindaugas Gervaldas). Each of these Lithuanian National Socialist Parties used a range of flags, many of which are derived from those of their predecessors.
Regardless of their varying names and flags, members of all these groups attacked Lithuania's minorities of Jews, Poles and Russians, and demanded that these minorities be made to leave Lithuania. They also advocated restrictions on immigration and on the import of foreign goods and expressed doubts about whether Lithuania should seek EU membership. Mindaugas Murza compared globalism to Zionism, and preaches hatred of the Jews (anti-Semitism) and other Nazi policies, including paraphrasing the German National Socialist slogan with &quot;Lithuania, wake up!&quot; Murza was imprisoned for his activities, but his followers still occasionally cause trouble.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The VLNDS flag most frequently used was originally described as the &quot;National&quot; flag. The party described the cross as the combination of two swastikas, one right-facing and one left-facing. The flag they called the &quot;Honor&quot; flag has never appeared in any public demonstrations and was perhaps only used during private meetings, if any copies were made at all, for its design was never made known to the public. The VLNDS &quot;Party&quot; flag (&quot;Organizational&quot; flag, as it was called by them) was shown at the party website, but its actual use was not verifed so far. It is derived from the flag used by the LNDP in 2001-2007 (while Murza and his followers were its members) and also by the VLNDS in early 2007, but the white disc and black cross of the original design were reduced in size and superimposed over a &quot;Black Sun,&quot; a well-known Nazi symbol, depicted here in gold color. To denote its ideological heritage, the VLNDS also sometimes used the flags of the Lithuanian Union of National Socialist Unity and the Lithuanian National Socialist Party.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The flag of the Lithuanian Union of National Socialist Unity (LNSVS) which featured a white swastika on a white outlined red disc placed on a red field, was most likely the flag of some earlier neo-Nazi group, because it does seem to be more traditional, and there have been many similar organizations previously in Lithuania. Their verified flag was similar to that of the LNDP, but was charged with a cross crosslet instead of the cross potent. The Lithuanian National Labour Union (LTDS), founded by a re-organization of the Lithuanian Union of National Socialist Unity (LNSVS), but replaced almost imediately the next year, used a flag that had a red cross crosslet on white field which differed from most used among the neo-Nazi groups in Lithuania that all favored red fields. Its replacement, the Lithuanian National Socialist Party (LNSP), used a red flag charged with a white cross crosslet on a white outlined red disc; the dark shade of red was also sometimes attributed to other flags used, but was verified only for this one.</P></TD>

The LRA operates in northern Uganda, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. The LRA has been blamed for widespread human rights violations, including reported murder, abduction, mutilation, cannibalism, sexual enslavement, and seizing child conscripts to participate their terrorists activities. The LRA forces are now shrunken in size and on the defensive, with Ugandan Defense Forces, aided by American Special Forces commando trainers, determined to put an end to their violent activities. The remaining LRA forces appear to be now mostly active in the Orientale province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the DRC provides a safe zone and refuses to allow Ugandan troops to enter in pursuit of the LRA.</P>  
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The illustrated red-black-blue striped flag, although commonly presented as the LRA flag, might, according to Vexillologist Jaume Oll&eacute;, be a variant of a South Sudanese Liberation Movement flag photographed with South Sudanese guerrilla fighters operating within North Uganda and mistaken for the LRA.  The colors are, however, the same as those used by the Uganda People's Congress Party, but with the top red-black stripes reversed. Many Ugandans still associate the UPC party with the military excesses of the past and especially the rule of the Military Junta of the early 1980s and the resulting civil war.</P> 
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">According to Oll&eacute;, the Lord's Resistance Army flag is a bicolored striped flag (either red-yellow or yellow-red) of two horizontal stripes (these colors are also present on the LRA uniforms). He adds that the flag is defaced with an emblem showing a half moon, a star, law tables, and a heart in the design. Unfortunately neither his red-yellow flag, or the commonly accepted red-black-blue flag, have been reliably documented, and since contact with the LRA is difficult, exactly which flag they are using, if any, remains a mystery.</P></TD>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The <I>Movimiento Nacional Socialista de Chile</I> (MNSC) was formed in 1932 by General Diaz Valderrama, Carlos Keller, and Jorge Gonz&aacute;lez von Mar&eacute;es, who became leader. Initially supporting the ideas of Adolf Hitler, the party received financial support from the German population of Chile and claimed a membership of 20,000 people. The movement stressed what it saw as the need for one party rule and solidarity between classes, and soon set up its own paramilitary wing, the <I>Tropas Nacistas de Asalto</I>. However, support for Hitler was abandoned in the late 1930s and anti-Semitism was scaled back, with a more domestic form of Fascism being offered publicly. The movement was active until 1938, when it merged into the Popular Liberating Alliance (<I>Alianza Popular Libertadora</I>), a nationalist and populist party which eventually distanced itself from the Fascism.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The flag used by the MNSC was derived from the first Chilean flag by addition of a red thunderbolt pointing upwards. As the oldest Chilean Nazi flag, it was reused in 21st century by neo-Nazi groups such as the National Order Front.</P></TD>

Although political observers have considered the MNR to be a far-right party, the MNR presents itself as classical liberal and nationalist. It opposes immigration, Islamisation, and the European Union, but, unlike the National Front, supports free markets and neoliberalism.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The group  uses the emblem an oak leaf, usually within a French tricolor flag. According to the party's website, &quot;the oak leaf within the tricolor flag is the symbol of the struggle for our identity, of the attachment to our roots and of the continuity of our country. The oak symbolizes strength, nobleness and justice. In ancient Rome, the oak represented the civic virtues. It is shown in the arms of the [French] monarchy as well as in the arms of the Republic.&quot;</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The flag of the MNR is vertically divided blue-red with, in the middle a white oak leaf with blue veins. The supporters of the MNR sometimes use another flag, probably unofficial, made of the French national flag charged in the middle of the white stripe with a tricolor oak leaf not reaching the horizontal edges of the flag.</P><A NAME="mnsdp"></A></TD>

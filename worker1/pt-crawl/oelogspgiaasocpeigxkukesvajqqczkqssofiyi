<a NAME="18!"></a>&#352;tef&#225;nik Flag / Flag of the Czechoslovak National Council</h2>
At the Historical museum of the National Slovakian museum of Bratislava,
I found a reproduction of a display "birth of Czechoslovakian Republic"
showing a rather special flag for Czechoslavakia..
<br><i>Joan-Franc&#233;s Blanc</i> 19 March 1998
<p>I think I saw this flag mentioned as the flag of a Czechoslovakian unit
in the post-WWI war against the young Soviet Russia. In other words, the
flag of one of the 'white' armies. I think I saw this in a museum in Prague,
but I have no recollection of which one.
<br><i>Ole Andersen</i>, 17 Feb 2000
<p>The so-called "&#352;tef&#225;nik Flag" became the official banner or flag of
the Czechoslovak National Council, and was primarily used as the Czechoslovak
War Flag after the General inspected the Legion units in Siberia at the
end of 1918. It consisted of a white stripe above a red one. The letter
"&#268;S" in yellow color were inscribed in the center. There was a relatively
wide blue border at the top, bottom and outside edges and a blunt blue
wedge along the remaining side. The General himself explained the flag's
symbolism thus: "The war flag of the Czechoslovak army is plain: colors:
white, red, blue, blue like a wedge which we have used to smash an iceberg
of misunderstanding, disfavor, resentment and malice. Our white and red
colors appear on a blue background as they may appear on a blue sky, from
which, God willing, the cloud of subjugation has been banished forever"."

<p>I visited Czeck Army Museum and took several photos of old flags and
proposed flags - Czeckslovakia National Council &nbsp;flag and Arms 1918
<br><i>Nozomi Kariyasu</i>, 24 Jul 2009
<p>The flag is identical to Jarig's, but with a considerably darker blue.

<p>Interestingly, the arms are divided by what appears to be a fasces.
<br><i>Eugene Ipavec</i>, 22 Aug 2009
<p>The official revolutionary coat of arms of the Czechoslovak National
Council used since 1918 was designed by graphic artist R. R&#367;&#382;i&#269;ka. It is
generally less well known, since it was primarily used on the Council documents.
The insignia was formed of a quartered shield with Czech Lands coat of
arms, bisected in the middle by the Prince Svatopluk bundle of twigs signifying
the unity of the republic. The white lion on red represents the Kingdom
of Bohemia; the red and white checquered eagle on blue represents the Margravate
of Moravia; the black eagle on yellow symbolizes the Duchy of Silesia;
and the white Lorraine cross on red emanating from a three-mountain represents
Slovakia.

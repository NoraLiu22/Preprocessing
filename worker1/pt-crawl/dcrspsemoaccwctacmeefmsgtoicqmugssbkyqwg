<p>The two Royal Lions are appropriate because Berkshire is a Royal County, a privilege is unique among shire counties. They are derived from the arms attributed to the Norman kings and have association with Reading Abbey, which was founded by Henry I. The embattled border to the shield is intended to represent the castles of the County, of which Windsor is the best known survivor.<br>
The crest is based upon the badge of the old Royal Berkshire Militia, and there is a tradition that a banner with this symbol, or one similar, was carried by the men of Berkshire at the Battle of Agincourt. The stag under the oak tree is assumed to represent the stags and oaks of Windsor Forest, which gave royal sport to the Saxon and Norman kings. William I, who had an eye for good hunting country when he chose Windsor for his residence and began its famous Castle.<br>
The Red Lion Supporter is another Royal symbol, and the Tudor Rose on the Lion's collar, a Royal asso�ciation with Windsor Castle. The White Horse is a reference is to the historic carving in the chalk of a great White Horse on the top of the Downs near Uffington. The horse has a pendant with a wedge shape upon it; this shape is known in heraldry as a "pile" and its inclusion here tells in punning form of the atomic pile at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell.</p>

<p>The arms were based very much upon the former Berkshire Arms. The principal change was the substitution of a Black Horse for a White Horse as the right-hand supporter, the White Horse representing the White Horse of Uffington which is no longer in the county. The Black Horse represents the county's considerable connections with horse-racing, there being a reference in old county histories to the ancient native horses of Berkshire being black. The six-pointed star on the collar, refers to the six borough and districts in the county, and also to the close association of Slough with the celebrated astronomer Sir William Herschel.</p>

<p>The wavy bend stands for the River Cam, formerly a channel of trade and a source of prosperity, hence  it is tinctured gold. It also represents the Cambridgeshire Fens, the last English home of the great bustard (now extinct in this country) which supports the shield and represents the wild life of the shire. The double-tressure of fleurs-de-lis is from the Royal Arms of Scotland, its presence in the arms of this English County being due to the fact that in the twelfth century the Earldom of Cambridge (united with that of Huntingdon) was held by David I, King of Scotland, husband of Earl Waltheof's daughter Matilda.<br>
In this fenland William I encountered the sturdy opposition of Hereward the Wake and his followers, and the castle forming the crest is that which the Conqueror built at Cambridge as his headquarters against 'the last of the English'. The helmet is a sign of a knight bachelor in token of Sir H.G. Fordham, Chairman of the County Council when the arms were granted.<br>
The motto is an allusion to the river, the fens, and the agriculture which is the County's main industry.</p>

<p>The wavy blue band across the shield, like that in the arms of the former <a href="obs_county.html#cambridgeshire cc former">Cambridgeshire CC</a>,  refers to the River Cam, which apart from being a geographical feature was for long important as a trade route and a source of prosperity. The three golden crowns are from the of arms of the <a href="obs_county.html#isle of ely cc">Isle of Ely CC</a>. Forming a border on the shield are double lines set with fleurs-de-lis; this is derived from the Royal Arms of Scotland because the Earldom of the shire was held by Kings of Scotland in the twelfth century. Above the shield is a mural crown, a common symbol of civic government.<br>
The two supporting birds are Great Bustards, now extinct in Britain. It is claimed that this county formed their last English habitat; it is interesting to note that Wiltshire also claims the last associations with these magnificent birds and shows one in its Arms. Each bird stands on a book as an allusion to the University of Cambridge.<br>
The motto applies both to the community attitude of the area and to the significance of the part played by education throughout it.</p>

<p>The blue lion is from the arms of the Brus family who, following the Norman Conquest, were given substantial lands in what is now Cleveland, and its collar and crown are similar to those in the heraldry of the Dukes of Cleveland. Charles II created Barbara Villiers Duchess of Cleveland in 1670 and their illegitimate son became the first Duke upon the death of his mother in 1709. The flames symbolize the energy industry generally, the  ancient ship represents shipping, the cogwheel - engineering and the hexagon - the petro-chemical industry. The two vertical lines separating these symbols represent the railways and are a reminder that the
World's first passenger railway had its terminus at Stockton-on-Tees.<br>
The anchor resting on the grassy mount represents the sea and the golden 'estoiles' are identical to the polar stars in the arms of Captain Cook, but are blazoned as estoiles as they are not in a North-South position.<br>
The supporters consist of a Hartlepool hart and a Cleveland Bay horse, each with a hoof resting on three steel ingots, representing the iron and steel industry.<br>
The motto "Endeavour" was chosen not only for its obvious message but because <i>Endeavour</i> was the name of Captain James Cook's ship.</p>

<p>The three gold crowns on red are from the arms of the <a href="ecclesiastical.html#ely see">See of Ely</a>, which were used by the County Council before they obtained arms of their own. They refer particularly to St Etheldreda, the foundress of the religious house which has become the Cathedral. Etheldreda was a lady of the royal house of East Anglia to which, long after its extinction, the heralds assigned for arms three gold crowns on blue. The blue and white waves refer to the fens and many local waterways.<br>
The knot refers to Hereward the Wake, but there is no evidence to support the tradition that Hereward was the ancestor of the family named Wake, but he has been credited with their knot. The eel refers to the supposed derivation of the name from 'eel isle', stated by Bede to be due to 'the great plenty of eels taken in those marshes'.</p>

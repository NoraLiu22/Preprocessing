                    <strong>SEATTLE, Dec. 4&mdash; </strong>
                    Rock musicians of the 1970's and their fans loathed disco music: they said the music was gimmicky, banal and predictable.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    By 1979, when disco had become an industry generating $4 billion annually and there were an estimated 15,000 discoth&egrave;ques in the nation, a backlash was inevitable. It was symbolized by the reaction of thousands of rock fans who held an anti-disco rally at a baseball game at Comiskey Park in Chicago and set fire to an estimated 10,000 disco records.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Mainstream rock 'n' roll music tells us disco was a waste, a low mark in American music history in the last 30 years,'' said Robert Santelli, director and chief executive of the Experience Music Project here, a multicolored and swooping museum designed by Frank Gehry that is devoted to rock.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Perhaps it was as inevitable as the backlash, but now playing at Mr. Santelli's museum is disco, the revisionist theory.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Disco has not gotten true credit,'' said Mr. Santelli, 50, an author of several books on rock and the blues, who in the 70's listened to Bruce Springsteen in Jersey City. ''There's a great value in understanding the history of disco because it teaches us what America was about in the 70's,'' he said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The result is what is believed to be the first serious exhibition of the glittery phenomenon and its continuing impact on music from pop icons like Madonna and Michael Jackson, to teeny-bopper stars like Christina Aguilera and the band 'N Sync to the Latin pop of Ricky Martin, and even to the shores of hip-hop.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Called ''Disco: A Decade of Saturday Nights,'' the exhibition, which runs until May 26, explores the pop phenomenon that began in the New York underground party scene of the early 1970's, influenced by black and gay urban culture. By the early 1980's disco had exhausted itself: disco clubs like the cocaine-drenched Studio 54 in New York were stamped by an exclusivity that left a sour aftertaste, and the music was so oversold that it attracted the most unlikely singers.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Yes, there was Donny Osmond. But the most improbable one was Ethel Merman bellowing ''There's No Business Like Show Business'' to a disco beat. (You can hear this recording, which she made for her 1979 disco album, at the exhibition.)        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Disco was about escapism, but it became inescapable,'' said Barry Walters, a senior music critic at Rolling Stone and one of the curators of the show. '' In some ways it defeated its own purposes.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    It was to many rock fans terrible music. Musicians and critics said that the form was a pointed contrast to the works of diverse performer-songwriters of the 60's and 70's like Jimi Hendrix, with his showmanship and virtuosic guitar playing, as well as Bob Dylan, Mr. Springsteen and others. Their works helped redefine popular music with songs rooted in the blues that were alternately poetic, confessional and political. By contrast disco was about dancing and, to some degree, about sexual liberation.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    AIDS helped kill disco. Frank Crapanzano, 68, a onetime guidance counselor in the South Bronx who donated photographs, clothes and videotapes of the era to the museum show, returned to New York after the show opened on Nov. 23. ''I wanted to call all my old friends about this wonderful show,'' said Mr. Crapanzano, a habitu&eacute; of Studio 54 and other clubs who with his companion invented the campy ''beanie boys'' style with their crocheted hats. ''There was no one to call. I didn't know anybody from the old days who was alive.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Santelli said that earlier this year, as the museum staff was exploring musical periods that had been ignored for possible shows, Eric Weisbard, senior program manager of the Experience Music Project's education department, received a phone call from a friend, Vince Aletti, a journalist and record company executive who wrote the first article about disco in Rolling Stone in September 1973. He was seeking a repository for his substantial collection of disco memorabilia (including an opening-night invitation to Studio 54) and records.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Weisbard, one of the show's creators, said he believed that disco probably began on Valentine's Day 1970, when a New York D.J., David Mancuso, opened his loft on lower Broadway for a party that was called ''Love Saves the Day,'' or ''LSD.'' Mr. Mancuso set up a sound system that played music continually for hours, without records being changed one at a time as was the custom, and he sold tickets. Soon dance clubs began proliferating, and not just in New York.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The basic gay influence on disco was always apparent (Mr. Weisbard said it was illegal until the 1960's in New York for men to dance together), but, he said, there was always a clear racial element. In the 1960's, he added, the counterculture listened to a blend of white and black music. By the 1970's, Mr. Weisbard said, this racial mix was becoming undone.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Rock got white and whiter at the same time that disco was emerging,'' he said. Popular rock groups like Led Zeppelin and the Eagles were heard on FM radio. Disco emerged mostly on AM stations, which played black and Latino music.        </p>

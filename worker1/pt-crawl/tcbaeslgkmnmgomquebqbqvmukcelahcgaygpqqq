<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How many seniors are there?</h3>
<p>The senior community makes up a large portion of American society, with millions of elderly and older adults facing similar challenges exclusive to their community. <span style="font-weight: 400;">According the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://www.census.gov/library/audio/profile-america/profileodd/profile-odd-04.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Census Bureau</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are currently over 51 million people over the age of 65, making up about 15% of the population in the US.</span> With such a large number of people, there is no doubt that each of us know someone who faces the challenges of the aging population.</p>

<h3>How many seniors are in the workplace?</h3>
<p>In a time where older Americans are prone to age discrimination, disability, and chronic health conditions, there are questions concerning the number of seniors who make up an active workforce.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly one out of six elderly Americans are still involved in the workforce, about 9.1 million people. In Alaska, 25.9% of seniors who are aged 65 and older are still participating in the work force, the highest percentage amongst the 50 states. </span></p>
<h2>Senior disability</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disability amongst the population increases as the age increases. Senior disability is a common reason why many seniors are unable to continue working. In states such as Oklahoma, about 43% of the senior population suffers from one or more disabilities pertaining to cognition, hearing, eyesight, walking, self-maintenance, and completing errands.</span></p>
<h2>Population projections for the future</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2018/comm/historic-first.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US Census Bureau’s 2017 National Population Projection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the year 2035, the projected percentage of older adults (65 years and older) surpassed the projected number of children under 18, and historic first in US population projections. In the year 2060, the number of seniors above the age of 65 is projected to be 98 million people. </span></p>

<h2>Senior health conditions and disease</h2>
<p>As an older adults age, it is common to have chronic health conditions and disease. The senior community is heavily impacted by illness and chronic conditions, and many resources (such as care homes) cater to health needs of the elderly.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://www.ncoa.org/news/resources-for-reporters/get-the-facts/healthy-aging-facts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Council of Aging </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates that 80% of older adults suffer from at least one chronic condition (such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke) and 77% have more than two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seniors are also at high risk for accidents, specifically, falls, which are extremely dangerous for seniors and older adults. It is estimated that every 11 seconds, an aging adult will visit the emergency room due to a serious fall, while every 19 minutes, an older adult will die from a fall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to providing health care for an ailing population, it is crucial to have enough caretakers in the workforce in order to meet high demands. The trajectory in meeting these demands seem positive. Since </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://assets.americashealthrankings.org/app/uploads/ahrsenior18-finalv1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">America’s Health Ranking senior report in 2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the number of home health care workers per 1,000 adults (aged 75 and older) has increased by 19.7%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also examines senior access the dental care, which plays an important role in both oral and heart health. Senior dental health also improved with the rate of dental visits increasing by 2% and teeth extraction decreasing by 10%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one examines other health conditions amongst the senior population, there are hopeful reports. According to the</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://www.prb.org/aging-unitedstates-fact-sheet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Population Reference Bureau’s 2017 report on aging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the proportion of Americans living with dementia has decreased over the past 25 years, and may be a result of better brain health. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, other conditions such as obesity amongst older adults (age 65 to 74 years old) has increased 40% from 2009 to 2012.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
Senior suicide and loneliness</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics concerning senior depression, suicide, and loneliness point to an obvious silent epidemic amongst an often-forgotten population. The </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://www.ncoa.org/news/resources-for-reporters/get-the-facts/healthy-aging-facts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Council on Aging </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports that one in four older adults struggle with mental health and suffer from anxiety, depression, and dementia. The rate is projected to double by 2030, with a number estimated of 15 million people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other reports such as the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://assets.americashealthrankings.org/app/uploads/ahrsenior18-finalv1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 senior report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from America’s Health Rankings describes how seniors how have increased risk of isolation, with the highest rates in Louisiana and Mississippi.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> report also notes that the suicide rate amongst seniors has increased 12% since 2014. Since 2012, the rate is highest among adults aged 45 to 54 at 19.7 deaths per 100,000 and among adults aged 85 and older at 19.0 deaths per 100,000. Seniors aged 55 to 64 have the third highest suicide rate of 18.7 deaths per 100,000.</p>

<h2>Seniors and social connectedness</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engagement in social and community activities play a major role in whether seniors feel loneliness. Those who were engaged with volunteer work in the community or attended religious services reported to feeling less lonely. Factors such as having strong ties to a social network, weekly contact with friends and family, sleeping more, and good health all played a large role in decreasing feelings of loneliness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is also playing an important role in helping older adults feel connected. In 2018, 85% of older adults are connected to the internet through their cell phones, using them for phone calls, texting, emailing, sharing pictures, and social media. Nearly 24% of older adults have made new friends online.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior poverty and hunger</span></h2>
<p>Statistics on senior poverty and hunger paint an unsettling picture of aging communities. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://www.ncoa.org/economic-security/money-management/debt/senior-debt-facts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Council of Aging </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports that over 25 million Americans over the age of 60 are 250% below the federal poverty level, making less than $29,425 annually.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, the Social Security Administration reported that amongst social security benefactors, 21% of married couples and 43% of single people over the age of 65 depended on social security benefits, which made up 90% of their income. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute on Assets and Social Policy reports that after paying off fundamental living expenses, one-third of seniors struggle with debt and have no money saved up. The National Council on Aging reports that as of 2016, more than 34.2% of seniors and older adults have credit card balances, while the Survey of Consumer Finances reports that 29.2% owed money on a mortgage, home of equity line of credit, or both.</span></p>
<p>In hopeful reports,  the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://assets.americashealthrankings.org/app/uploads/ahrsenior18-finalv1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">America’s Health Rankings 2018 senior report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that “food insecurity decreased 7 percent in the past year, indicating a smaller percentage of adults aged 60 and older faced the threat of hunger in the past 12 months.”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Population Reference Bureau also reports that the poverty rate amongst older adults aged 65 and older has dropped significantly over the past 50 years. The rate has dropped from 30% (1966) to just 10% in 2016. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money matters</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/life-leisure/2019/aarp-grandparenting-study-money-fact-sheet.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00289.017.pdf">2019 survey conducted by AARP</a>, researchers found that the number of grandparents has increased since 2001, from 56 million to 70 million. It is estimated that by 2030, more than 70% of all U.S. children 8 years old will have a living great-grandparent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also revealed that almost 94% of grandparents financial contribute to raising grandchildren, with a large majority even providing financial support by forgoing their own needs. The survey calculated a total contribution of almost $179 billion dollars a year, with grandparents supporting their grandchildren through gift giving, providing for necessities, contributing to college tuition and future welfare. Grandparents spend an average of $805 on gifts annually, and even contribute to other forms of fun and entertainment such as family vacations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Because grandparents highly value a college education for their grandchildren, about one in five grandparents contribute to their grandchildren’s college tuition. About 7% of grandparents have even taken on debt in order to help their grandchildren afford college, amounting to almost $4,075 annually. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addiction in older adults</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some older adults also face the troubles of early and late-onset addiction. According the Journal of Alcohol Health, about 25% of the elderly who struggle with substance abuse experience a late-onset addiction, which means the addiction developed after 65 years of age. Many seniors who struggle to transition through major changes in life such as retirement turn to addiction and substance abuse as a way to cope. 66% of alcoholic seniors deal with early on-set addiction, which means that the senior was dealing with a longer ongoing addiction before the age of 65.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://www.drugrehab.com/addiction/seniors/">Drug Rehab</a> also reports that the rates of accidental drug overdose increased elevenfold amongst seniors from age 45 to 64 from 1990 to 2010. Drug abuse amongst older adults between the age of 50 to 59 increased from 2.7% to 6.2% from 1990 to 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse services, amongst adults over the age of 65 years, about 17% have abused prescription medication. </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://addictionresource.com/addiction/substance-abuse-among-seniors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addiction Resource</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quotes more than 2.5 million seniors suffer from an addiction, with the highest rate among widowers over the age of 75. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug Rehab’s website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quotes between 5 to 8 million older adults suffering from substance abuse problems or mental health problems. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128202420/https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/life/info-2018/2019-travel-trends.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 survey from AARP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, senior travelers from the baby boomer generation expect to take 4-5 trips in the next year, with half traveling domestically, and half expecting to travel abroad and internationally. Senior travelers expect to spend at least $6,600 on their trips. In terms of popular destinations, 41% of senior travelers plan to visit Europe, while 20% plan to visit the Caribbean, and 11% planning to visit Asia and the Middle East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby boomer travelers differ from millennial travelers in unplugging from technology. When asked about taking work on vacations, baby boomer travelers are less likely to bring their work with them, with 57% who think it is not necessary to stay connected to work during vacation time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two major barriers that prevent seniors from traveling: finances and health concerns. 32% of traveling baby boomers say health problems and finances would limit their traveling.</span></p>

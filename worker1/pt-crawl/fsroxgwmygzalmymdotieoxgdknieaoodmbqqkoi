          <p>The International Trade Council (ITC) was formed by the Stamford Chamber of  Commerce in 2001 to provide a forum for members with interests in international  trade and to offer international educational, programming and networking  opportunities for its members.&nbsp; Over the years its membership and  activities have expanded.&nbsp; It is now recognized as a leading international  business organization in the State of Connecticut and beyond.</p>
<p>One of the ITC's primary activities is putting on events on international  trade and investment and on related topics.&nbsp; It has held numerous programs  on most aspects of international trade, including exporting, importing, trade  finance, international logistics, international distribution and marketing,  legal aspects of international trade and programs focusing on various countries  and trading blocs.</p>
<p>A major initiative of the ITC is its SITREP program.  SITREP (the Stamford Chamber International  Trade Resource Program) is an export/import counseling service offered by the  ITC to small and medium sized businesses in lower Fairfield County that are new  to exporting or importing or have limited international trade experience.  Through counseling sessions, ITC members will  help participants navigate the sea of export assistance programs offered by the  federal, state, and local governments and will advise participants on how to  address specific international trade issues the participant faces.  For more information on SITREP, <a href="SITREP.htm">click here</a>.</p>
<p>The Chamber prides itself in its partnerships with local, state and federal  governmental agencies, other nonprofits and educational institutions.&nbsp; The  ITC has forged partnerships and worked closely with the International Affairs  Bureau of the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, the  Connecticut Export Assistance Center of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the  Connecticut District Export Council, the Export-Import Bank, the U.S. Small  Business Administration and the City of Stamford, as well as various nonprofits  throughout the State and region involved in international issues, including  CBIA, the World Affairs Forum and the Westchester County Association.&nbsp; It  has partnered with the University of Connecticut and Central Connecticut State  University on a number of international initiatives.</p>
<p>The Chamber has hosted numerous delegations and dignitaries from various  countries, including China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Mexico and Brazil.&nbsp; It has  worked closely with the Mayor's office to serve as the business liaison on  international matters in the City of Stamford.</p>
<p>The ITC was instrumental in assisting the Mayor establish Stamford's sister  city relationship with Jiangdu, China.&nbsp; At the Mayor's request, the ITC  represented the business relationship with that city, including hosting  delegations from Jiangdu and sending a Chamber delegation to that city.  &nbsp;In addition, the ITC borrowed on its established business relationship  with Jiangdu to take a lead role in establishing the educational link with the  Jiangdu school system.&nbsp; That educational link, which is now entrenched in  the Stamford public school system, has resulted in numerous student and teacher  exchanges and a very active relationship between the students and teachers of  Stamford and Jiangdu.</p>
<p>The Chamber also serves as the Stamford host for an annual visit by Chinese  government officials from Connecticut's sister province in China, Shandong  Province, who attend the six-month China Scholars Program at Central  Connecticut State University in New Britain.</p>
<p>The Council provides a great opportunity for Chamber  members who have considered entering the global marketplace or who merely want  to explore or learn more about international trade opportunities.&nbsp; The  networking aspect of the ITC gives members access to others knowledgeable in  international trade who are always willing to share their insights and who may  be able to offer valuable services to a Chamber business.&nbsp; Anyone  interested in joining the ITC should contact the Chamber.&nbsp; Meetings are  held monthly (except in August) at 8AM, usually on the second Thursday of the  month.&nbsp; Meetings are open to all members, so confirm the meeting date with  the Chamber and join us.&nbsp; </p></td>

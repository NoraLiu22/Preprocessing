first electric railway track in Zimbabwe between Gweru and 
<a href="zw-harar.html">Harare</a> in October 1983 while the book represents the various educational
institutions in the city. The original helmet and mantling have been removed and
the motto changed to �Progress�.

<p>Gwelo lies in
the centre of the country and was established as a coaching station
on the <a href="zw-bulaw.html">Bulawayo</a> - <a href="zw-harar.html#sa">Salisbury</a> route in the late 1890s and became a municipality
in 1917 and a city in 1971. Unlike the other major centres in the country,
the early development of Gwelo�s municipal arms is not recorded with a
seal for the municipality only being sent to the then Rhodesia Heraldry
and Genealogy Society in 1973. Full arms for the city are to be found as
Trade Marks Book Register Number 310 dated 26 April 1976 and are described
as:
<p>ARMS:&nbsp; Per chevron vert on a pall reversed ermine between in chief
a bull�s head cabossed Argent Or and a cob of maize of the last in base
a sun gear Or with two plantetary gears enmashed argent.
<br>CREST: On a wreath or gules and vert a Griffin segreant the forequarters
Azure and hindquarters Or grasping in Dexter foreclaw a sword argent pommel
and hilt or.
<br>MANTLING: Gules doubled Argent.
<br>MOTTO:&nbsp; �Forward�

by <i>Bruce Berry</i>, 19 Nov 2006<p>In keeping with the tradition followed by the other major centres in
the country, the city flew a flag which incorporated the municipal arms.
The Gwelo municipal flag comprised three vertical stripes of red, white
and red with a full achievement of the city arms in the centre of the white
stripe. This design followed the pattern of the <a href="zw-rhod.html">Rhodesian</a> national flag
which was green, white and green with the national arms in the centre. The flag
was used until after independence when Gwelo was renamed Gweru and adopted new
municipal symbols in 1986 (see above).<i><br>

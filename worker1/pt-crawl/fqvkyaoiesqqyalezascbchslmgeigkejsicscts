    Peter was elevated in mob status on word from FBI informants that he was his 
    brother�s keeper �on the street, specifically collecting money from a number

    Rodgers in explaining why the FBI planned to eavesdrop on Peter�s jailhouse 
    conversations with Junior last year.</span></p>

      In one ironic discussion, Junior said he had just received a message from 
      Bonanno boss Joseph<a href="column418.htm"> Massino</a> (left) that his turncoat brother-in-law Salvatore 
      Vitale was a �lying rat� who had implicated Junior in the
      <a href="column396.htm">�Bonnie and 
      Clyde�</a> murders of a husband and wife team that had robbed Gambino and 
      Bonanno family social clubs in the early 1990s.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">
      Junior denied allegations that he �was in the room with Vitale� and 
      Massino when the murders of Thomas and Rosemarie Uva were discussed, 
      saying he �took a walk with Vitale.� </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">
      Now that Massino has joined Vitale as a cooperating witness, it really 
      doesn�t matter whether Junior was in the room with Massino or taking a 
      walk with Vitale. The brothers-in-law have each told the feds that Junior 
      took credit for the Uva murders, sources say.</span></span></b></font></td>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="6">Christian Persecution in India: The
Real Story</font></strong><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<p>We have heard about what the Christians in India have called the persecutions
against them. However, there is much more to this story than we often hear, and
there are certainly two sides to it. The following is a first-hand investigative
article that relates what has really been going on with the Christians in India,
much of which has been kept from the public. This shows the duplicity in the Christian activities in India. This article, by Francois
Gautier, is reprinted from the &quot;Annual Research Journal, 2001&quot;
published by the Institute for Rewriting Indian [and World] History.<br wp="br1">

<p align="center"><strong>WILL HINDUISM SURVIVE THE PRESENT CHRISTIAN OFFENSIVE?</strong><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong>By Francois Gautier</strong><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<p align="left">When Prime Minister Vajpayee was in the US in September (2000) ,
the National Association of Asian Christians in the US (whom nobody had heard
about before), paid $ 50,000 to the New York Times to publish &quot;an Open
Letter to the Honorable Atal Bihari Vajpayee, prime minister of India.&quot;</p>
<p>While &quot;warmly welcoming the PM,&quot; The NAAC expressed deep concern
about the &quot;persecution&quot; of Christians in India by
&quot;extremist&quot; (meaning Hindu) groups mentioning as examples &quot;the
priest, missionaries and church workers who have been murdered,&quot; the nuns
&quot;raped,&quot; and the potential enacting of conversion laws, which would
make &quot;genuine&quot; conversions illegal. The letter concluded by saying
&quot;that Christians in India today live in fear.&quot;
<p>The whole affair was an embarrassment (as it was intended to be) to Mr.
Vajpayee and the Indian delegation, which had come to prod American businessmen
to invest in India, a peaceful, pro-Western and democratic country.&nbsp;
<p>I am born a Christian and I have had a strong Catholic education. I do
believe that Christ was an incarnation of Pure Love and that His Presence still
radiates in the world. I also believe there are human beings who sincerely try
to incarnate the ideals of Jesus and that you can find today in India a few
missionaries (such as Father Ceyrac, a French Jesuit, who works mostly with
lepers in Tamil Nadu) who are incarnations of that Love, tending tirelessly to
people, without trying to convert them.
<p>But I have also lived for more than 30 years in India, I am married to an
Indian, I have travelled the length and breadth of this country and I have
evolved a love and an understanding of India, which few other foreign
correspondents have because they are never posted long enough to start getting a
real feeling of this vast and often baffling country (nobody can claim to fully
understand India). And this is what I have to say about the
&quot;persecution&quot; of Christians in India.
<p>Firstly, it is necessary to bring about a little bit of a historical
flashback, which very few foreign correspondents (and unfortunately also Indian
journalists) care to do, which would make for a more balanced view of the
problem.
<p>If ever there was persecution, it was of the Hindus at the hands of
Christians, who were actually welcomed in this country, as they have been
welcomed in no other place on this planet. Indeed, the first Christian community
of the world, that of the Syrian Christians, was established in Kerala in the
first century. They were able to live in peace and practice their religion
freely, even imbibing some of the local Hindu customs, thereby breaking the
Syrian Church in two.
<p>When Vasco de Gama landed in Kerala in 1498, he was generously received by
the Zamorin, the Hindu king of Calicut, who granted him the right to establish
warehouses for commerce. But once again, Hindu tolerance was exploited and the
Portuguese wanted more and more. In 1510, Alfonso de Albuquerque seized Goa,
where he started a reign of terror, burning &quot;heretics,&quot; crucifying
Brahmins, using false theories to forcibly convert the lower castes, razing
temples to build churches upon them and encouraging his soldiers to take Indian
mistresses.
<p>Indeed, the Portuguese perpetrated here some of the worst atrocities ever
committed in Asia by Christianity upon another religion. Ultimately, the
Portuguese had to be kicked out of India, when all other colonisers had already
left.
<p>British missionaries in India were always supporters of colonialism. They
encouraged it and their whole structure was based on &quot;the good Western
civilized world being brought to the Pagans.&quot; Because, in the words of
Claudius Buchanan, a chaplain attached to the East India Company, &quot;Neither
truth, nor honesty, honour, gratitude, nor charity, is to be found in the breast
of a Hindoo!&quot; What a comment about a nation that gave the world the Vedas
at a time when Europeans were still grappling in their caves!
<p>And it is in this way that the British allowed entire chunks of territories
in the East, where lived tribals, whose poverty and simplicity made them easy
prey to be converted to Christianity. By doing so, the Christian missionaries
cut a people from their roots and tradition, made them look westwards towards a
culture and a way of life which was not theirs.
<p>And the result is there today for everyone to see: it is in these eastern
states, some of which are 90 per cent Christian, that one finds the biggest drug
problems (and crime) in India. It should also be said that many of the eastern
separatist movements have been covertly encouraged by Christian missionaries on
the ground that &quot;tribals were there before the 'Aryan Hindus' invaded India
and imposed Hinduism upon them.&quot;
<p>The trouble is that the latest archaeological and linguistic discoveries
point to the fact that there NEVER was an Aryan invasion of India --it just was
an invention of the British and the missionaries to serve their purpose.
Aryanism is a synonym of Vedic culture.
<p>Secondly, Christianity has always striven on the myth of persecution, which
in turn bred &quot;martyrs&quot; and saints, indispensable to the propagation of
Christianity. But it is little known, for instance, that the first
&quot;saints&quot; of Christianity, &quot;martyred&quot; in Rome, a highly
refined civilization which had evolved a remarkable system of gods and
goddesses, derived from Hindu mythology via the Greeks, were actually killed (a
normal practice in those days) while bullying peaceful Romans to embrace the
&quot;true&quot; religion, in the same way that later Christian missionaries
will browbeat &quot;heathen&quot; Hindus, adoring many gods into believing that
Jesus was the only &quot;true&quot; god.
<p>Now to come to the recent cases of persecution of Christians in India at the
hands of Hindu groups. I have personally investigated quite a few, amongst them
the rape of the four nuns in Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, nearly two years ago. This
rape is still quoted as an example of the &quot;atrocities&quot; committed by
Hindus on Christians.
<p>Yet, when I interviewed the four innocent nuns, they themselves admitted,
along with George Anatil, the bishop of Indore, that it had nothing to do with
religion: It was the doing of a gang of Bhil tribals, known to perpetrate this
kind of hateful acts on their own women. Today, the Indian press, the Christian
hierarchy and the politicians, continue to include the Jhabua rape in the list
of atrocities against Christians.&nbsp;
<p>Or take the burning of churches in Andhra Pradesh a few months ago, which was
supposed to have been committed by the &quot;fanatic&quot; RSS. It was proved
later that it was actually the handiwork of Indian Muslims, at the behest of the
ISI to foment hatred between Christians and Hindus. Yet the Indian press, which
went berserk at the time of the burnings, mostly kept quiet when the true nature
of the perpetrators was revealed.&nbsp;
<p>Finally, even if Dara Singh does belong to the Bajrang Dal, it is doubtful if
the hundred other accused do. What is more probable, is that like in many other
&quot;backward&quot; places, it is a case of converted tribals versus
non-converted tribals, of pent-up jealousies, of old village-feuds and land
disputes. It is also an outcome of what -- it should be said -- are the
aggressive methods of the Pentecost and Seventh Day Adventist missionaries,
known for their muscular ways of conversion.
<p><br wp="br1">
Thirdly, conversions in India by Christian missionaries of low caste Hindus and
tribals are sometimes nothing short of fraudulent and shameful acts. American
missionaries are investing huge amounts of money in India, which come from
donation-drives in the United States where gullible Americans think the dollars
they are giving go towards uplifting &quot;poor and uneducated&quot;
Indians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is common in Kerala, for instance, particularly in the poor coastal
districts, to have &quot;miracle boxes&quot; put in local churches. The gullible
villager writes out a paper mentioning his wish such as a fishing boat, a loan
for a pucca house, fees for the son's schooling. And lo, a few weeks later the
miracle happens! And of course the whole family converts, making others in the
village follow suit.
<p>American missionaries (and their government) would like us to believe that
democracy includes the freedom to convert by any means. But France for example,
a traditionally Christian country, has a minister who is in charge of hunting
down &quot;sects.&quot; And by sects, it is meant anything that does not fall
within the recognized family of Christianity -- even the Church of Scientology,
favoured by some Hollywood stars such as Tom Cruise or John Travolta, is
ruthlessly hounded. And look at what the Americans did to the Osho movement in
Arizona, or how innocent children and women were burnt down by the FBI (with the
assistance of the US army) at Waco, Texas, because they belonged to a dangerous
sect.
<p>Did you know that Christianity is dying in the West? Not only is church
attendance falling dramatically because spirituality has deserted it, but less
and less youth accept the vocation to become priests or nuns. And as a result,
say in the rural parts of France, you will find only one priest for six or seven
villages, whereas till the late seventies, the smallest hamlet had its own
parish priest.
<p>And where is Christianity finding new priests today? In the Third World, of
course! And India, because of the innate impulsion of its people towards god, is
a very fertile recruiting ground for the Church, particularly in Kerala and
Tamil Nadu. Hence the huge attention that India is getting from the United
States, Australia, or England and the massive conversion drive going on today.
<p>It is sad that Indians, once converted, specially the priests and nuns, tend
to turn against their own country and help in the conversion drive. There are
very few &quot;White&quot; missionaries left in India and most of the
conversions are done today by Indian priests.
<p>Last month, during the bishop's conference in Bangalore, it was restated by
bishops and priests from all over India that conversion is the FIRST priority of
the Church here. But are the priests and bishops aware that they would never
find in any Western country the same freedom to convert that they take for
granted in India? Do they know that in China they would be expelled, if not put
into jail? Do they realize that they have been honoured guests in this country
for nearly two thousand years and that they are betraying those that gave them
peace and freedom?&nbsp;
<p>Hinduism, the religion of tolerance, and spirituality of this new millennium,
has survived the unspeakable barbarism of wave after wave of Muslim invasions,
the insidious onslaught of Western colonialism which has killed the spirit of so
many Third World countries, and the soul-stifling assault of Nehruvianism. But
will it survive the present Christian offensive?
<p>Many Hindu religious leaders feel Christianity is a real threat today, as in
numerous ways it is similar to Hinduism, from which Christ borrowed so many
concepts. (See Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's book: &quot;Hinduism and
Christianity&quot;)
<p>It is thus necessary that Indians themselves become more aware of the danger
their culture and unique civilization is facing at the hands of missionaries
sponsored by foreign money. It is also necessary that they stop listening to the
Marxist-influenced English newspapers' defense of the right of Christian
missionaries to convert innocent Hindus.
<p>Conversion belongs to the times of colonialism. We have entered the era of
Unity, of coming together, of tolerance and accepting each other as we are, not
of converting in the name of one elusive &quot;true&quot; god.
<p>When Christianity accepts the right of other people to follow their own
beliefs and creeds, then only will Jesus Christ's spirit truly radiate in the
world.

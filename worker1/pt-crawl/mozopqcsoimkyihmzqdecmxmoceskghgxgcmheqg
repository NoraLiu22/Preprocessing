 <h1><a name="_Toc142395816">II. How Censorship Works in </a>China: A Brief Overview</h1>

<h2><a name="_Toc142395817">1. The &#147;Great Firewall of </a>China&#148;: Censorship at the Internet backbone and ISP level</h2>

<p>Political censorship is built into all layers of China&#146;s Internet infrastructure. Known widely in the media as the &#147;Great Firewall of China,&#148;

this aspect of Chinese official censorship primarily targets the movement of

information between the global Internet and the Chinese Internet. </p>

<p>Internet censorship in the People&#146;s Republic of China (PRC) is overseen technically by the Ministry of Information Industry (MII). Policy

about what substantive content is to be censored is largely directed by the

State Council Information Office and the Chinese Communist Party&#146;s Propaganda

Department, with input from other government and public security organs.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font></a> Physical

access to the Internet is provided by nine state-licensed Internet Access

Providers (IAP), each of which has at least one connection to a foreign

Internet backbone, and it is through these connections that Chinese Internet

users access Internet websites hosted outside of China.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><font size="1"><sup>3</sup></font></a> The individual Chinese

Internet user buys Internet access from one of several thousand Internet

Service Providers (ISPs), who are in effect retail sellers of Internet access

that is in turn purchased wholesale from the nine IAPs.</p>

<p>Internet routers, devices that deliver and direct packets of

data back and forth between networks, are an essential part of Internet

networks. Most of today&#146;s routers also allow network administrators to censor

or block&#151;or, as the industry calls it, &#147;filter&#148;&#151;the data going through them,

programming the router to block certain kinds of data from passing in or out of

a network. This filtering capability was initially intended so that Internet

Service Providers could control viruses, worms, and spam. The same technology,

however, can also be easily employed to block political, religious, or any

other category of content that the person programming the router seeks to

block.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><font size="1"><sup>4</sup></font></a>

</p>

<p>The first layer of Chinese Internet censorship takes place

at this router level. According to the 2005 technical analysis of Chinese

Internet filtering conducted by the Open Net Initiative, IAP administrators

have entered thousands of URLs (Internet website addresses) and keywords into

the Internet routers that enable data to flow back and forth between ISPs in China and Internet servers around the world. Forbidden keywords and URLs are also plugged

into Internet routers at the ISP level, thus controlling data flows between the

user and the IAP. <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><font size="1"><sup>5</sup></font></a>

</p>

<p>This router-level censorship, configured into the hardware

of the Chinese Internet, is reinforced by software programs deployed at the

backbone and ISP level which conduct additional &#147;filtering&#148; of political

content. (In many countries such censorship software deployed at the backbone

and ISP level is a product called SmartFilter, developed by Secure Computing. China, however, has developed its own home-grown filtering software.)<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><font size="1"><sup>6</sup></font></a> Such filtering programs

are used globally by households, companies, and organizations for all kinds of

purposes: they enable employers to block employees from surfing pornography or

gambling online from the office, and enable schools to prevent young students

from accessing age-inappropriate content.</p>

<p>It is this type of censorship or blocking that causes an

error message to appear in the Chinese Internet user&#146;s browser when he or she

types, for example, http://www.hrw.org (the Human Rights Watch website) into

the address field of his or her browser. </p>

<p align="center"><img width="530" height="337" src="/web/20150422063645im_/http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/china0806_files/image002.gif"></p>

<p align="center">Figure 1: Error page appearing when user

attempts to access www.hrw.org on a Chinese ISP</p>

<p>It is important to note that while similar Internet

censorship is conducted in many countries, some governments choose to inform

their citizens that censorship is taking place, while other governments choose

to leave users with an error message that could be the result of any number of

problems, including user error or technical failure of the Internet connection.

In Saudi Arabia, when a user attempts to access a webpage that authorities have

chosen to block, they are directed not to a 404 error page as depicted in

Figure 1 above, but to a page informing the user that the page he or she is

attempting to access has been blocked in accordance with national laws, with

contact information in the event that the user believes the page was censored

in error.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><font size="1"><sup>7</sup></font></a></p>

<h2><a name="_Toc142395818">2. Censorship by Internet Content Providers:

Delegating censorship to business</a></h2>

<p>Building censorship into China&#146;s Internet infrastructure is

the first way in which the Chinese government seeks to block user access to

politically sensitive information. The second step is to prevent ISP&#146;s&#151;many of

them privately-held businesses, some with foreign investment&#151;from hosting

politically objectionable content by holding them liable for doing so.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><font size="1"><sup>8</sup></font></a> The third

step targets Internet Content Providers (ICPs): organizations or individuals

(either for-profit or non-profit) who provide publicly available content on the

Web (news, entertainment, or commercial websites), or who provide platforms on

which users can communicate and converse with one another (chatrooms and

bulletin board systems known commonly as BBS), or on which users can create and

share text, photographs, audio and video (blogging services, photo- and

video-sharing sites, podcasting and audio-sharing services, etc.). </p>

<p>All ICPs&#151;commercial or non-commercial&#151;are required to

register for and display a license in order to operate legally, and are held

liable for all content appearing on their websites, whether created by the

company&#146;s or organization&#146;s employees, or by any of the site&#146;s visitors or users

of its content-creation and sharing services. </p>

<p>If an ICP wants to obtain&#151;and keep&#151;its business license to

operate in China, it is &#160;expected to prevent the appearance of politically

objectionable content through automated means, or to police content being

uploaded by users for unacceptable material, which is then taken down manually

by company employees.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><font size="1"><sup>9</sup></font></a>

The obligation to do so is manifested in a &#147;voluntary pledge&#148; signed by

hundreds of organizations including Chinese companies, universities, and government

offices. This &#147;Public Pledge on Self-discipline for the Chinese Internet

Industry,&#148; initiated by the Internet Society of China (ISOC), commits

signatories to &#147;energetic efforts to carry forward the rich cultural tradition

of the Chinese nation and the ethical norms of the socialist cultural

civilization&#148; by observing all state industry regulations. In particular,

signatories vow to refrain &#147;from producing, posting, or disseminating

pernicious information that may jeopardize state security and disrupt social

stability.&#148;<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><font size="1"><sup>10</sup></font></a>

The Internet Society of China is the major professional association for the

Chinese Internet industry. While the ISOC is called a &#147;nongovernmental

organization,&#148; its &#147;governing body&#148; is the Ministry of Information Industry,<sup>

</sup>the government ministry in charge of China&#146;s national Internet

infrastructure.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><font size="1"><sup>11</sup></font></a>

To date, Yahoo! is the only Western company known to have signed the pledge (as

will be discussed further in Section IV, Part 1).<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><font size="1"><sup>12</sup></font></a> </p>

<p>The display of politically objectionable content can result

in reprimands to company management and employees from the MII, the State

Council Information Office, the Communist Party&#146;s Propaganda Department, and/or

various state security organs, accompanied by warnings that insufficient

controls will result in revocation of the company&#146;s license. In order to

minimize reprimands and keep their licenses in good standing, BBS and blog

hosting services maintain lists of words and phrases that either cannot be

posted or which cause monitoring software to &#147;flag&#148; the content for manual

removal by employees.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><font size="1"><sup>13</sup></font></a>

</p>

<p>Search engines likewise maintain lists of thousands of

words, phrases and web addresses to be filtered out of search results so that

links to politically objectionable websites do not even appear on the search

engine&#146;s results pages, even when those websites may be blocked at the backbone

or ISP level. Thus, the user is prevented from knowing that the forbidden

content exists at all. This is a deliberate choice made by the operator of the

search engine.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><font size="1"><sup>14</sup></font></a>

</p>

<p>In 2004, Xiao Qiang, Director of the China Internet Project

at the University of California at Berkeley, published one such list that had

been leaked from a Chinese instant messaging service (see Appendix I).<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><font size="1"><sup>15</sup></font></a> Another

similar list was obtained by the <i>Washington Post</i> from an unnamed Chinese

weblog hosting company in early 2006 (see Appendix II).<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><font size="1"><sup>16</sup></font></a> </p>

<p>Such lists are not given directly to Internet companies by

the Chinese government; rather, the government leaves the exact specifics and

methods of censorship up to companies themselves. Companies generate their &#147;block-lists&#148;

based on educated guesswork plus trial-and-error: what they know to be

politically sensitive, what they are told in meetings with Chinese officials,

and complaints they may receive from Chinese authorities in response to the

appearance of politically objectionable search results.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><font size="1"><sup>17</sup></font></a> </p>

<p>But the complicity of companies is even more direct: they

actually run diagnostic tests to see which words, phrases, and web addresses

are blocked by the Chinese authorities at the router level, and then add them

to their lists, without waiting to be asked by the authorities to add them. And

because they seek to stay out of trouble and avoid complaints from the

authorities, many businesspeople who run ICPs in China confess that they are

inclined to err on the side of caution and over-block content which does not

clearly violate any specific law or regulation, but which their instincts tell

them will displease the authorities who control their license.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><font size="1"><sup>18</sup></font></a> In all these ways, companies

are doing the government&#146;s work for it and stifling access to information.

Instead of being censored, they have taken on the role of censor. Yahoo!,

Microsoft&#146;s MSN, and Google all act as ICP&#146;s in China. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc142395819">3. Surveillance and censorship in email and web

chat</a></h2>

<p>As in most countries, email services hosted on servers

inside the PRC are expected to respond to requests by law enforcement

authorities for user information and copies of email communications. Yahoo!,

the only non-Chinese Internet company providing email services with user data

hosted inside the PRC, has responded to information requests in criminal cases,

as have all domestic Chinese businesses that provide email services. Because

Chinese law enforcement bodies and courts include a range of internationally

protected political speech in their interpretation of what constitute criminal

acts under Chinese domestic law, Yahoo!&#146;s compliance with Chinese law has

assisted in the conviction of at least four Chinese government critics (see

below, Section IV, part 1).</p>

<p>Mobile and Internet chat services licensed to sell services

to Chinese users inside the PRC are also required to filter politically

sensitive content. As mentioned in the previous section, in 2004 Xiao Qiang

obtained a block sensitive word list used by the popular QQ instant messaging

service, owned by the Chinese company Tencent.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><font size="1"><sup>19</sup></font></a> Human Rights Watch has received reports

from users of other Internet chat services that some messages containing

political content were sent but not received by the intended recipient. In at

least some cases, however, users suspected that the blocking had taken place at

the ISP or backbone level, rather than at the level of the chat client itself.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><font size="1"><sup>20</sup></font></a> However, at

least one international company, Skype, has admitted to building censorship

functions into its Chinese-language chat client developed jointly with the

Chinese company Tom Online (see Section IV, Part 4).<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><font size="1"><sup>21</sup></font></a></p>

<h2><a name="_Toc142395820">4. Breaching the Great Chinese Firewall</a></h2>

<p>Censorship at the gateway and ISP level can be circumvented

by the tech-savvy user through the use of proxy servers and other circumvention

technologies. A proxy server is an intermediary web server that the Internet

user can use to access other websites indirectly, so that the ISP only sees

that you are visiting the intermediary site but not the final destination site.

If an Internet user configures her web browser to access the Internet via a

proxy server located outside China, her web-surfing experience will be similar

(although necessarily slower) to that of users in the country where that

particular proxy server is hosted. Lists of proxy servers can be found on the

Internet, but the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of these proxies are quickly

blocked by administrators somewhere at the Chinese backbone or ISP level, making

them impossible to use. Users from inside China report having to search for a

new, unblocked proxy every thirty minutes to two hours. Software tools such as

Anonymizer, Tor, and others such as Dynapass (created by affiliates of

Falungong) have been devised to help users get around this problem either by

providing updates of new proxies or by setting up the software to automatically

discover new unblocked proxies.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><font size="1"><sup>22</sup></font></a>

Roger Dingledine, creator of Tor, reports that &#147;some tens of thousands&#148; of

people appear to be using Tor from China on a weekly basis.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><font size="1"><sup>23</sup></font></a> (Why the Chinese

government has, as of this writing, chosen not to block the proxy nodes used by

Tor is unknown.) </p>

<p>According to a 2000 Chinese Academy of Social Sciences

(CASS) survey of Internet use in five Chinese cities, 10 percent of users

surveyed admitted to regularly using, and 25 percent to occasionally using,

proxy servers to circumvent censorship.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><font size="1"><sup>24</sup></font></a> A 2005 CASS Internet user survey, asking

the same question, received the following response: &#147;never&#148;: 71.2 percent; &#147;seldom&#148;:

19.7 percent; &#147;sometimes&#148;: 5.9 percent; &#147;often&#148;: 2.5 percent; &#147;frequently&#148;: 0.6

percent.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><font size="1"><sup>25</sup></font></a>

As the number of new Internet users increases rapidly, exactly how many people

in China today really do use proxy servers on a regular basis&#151;compared to those

willing to admit doing so to pollsters&#151;is the subject of anecdotal speculation

and debate. However anecdotal evidence does support the CASS finding that while

many people&#151;especially university students&#151;may be aware of proxy servers and know

how to use them, the percentage of people who regularly use proxy servers to

access blocked sites is small. In 2005 the global citizens&#146; media weblog Global

Voices Online posted some questions to Chinese bloggers about proxy server use

in China, including: &#147;Of the people in China who use the internet regularly,

what percentage do you think know how to use proxies? Of the people you know,

what percentage know how to use proxies?&#148; Here is what the student blogger &#147;Undersound&#148;

wrote in response:</p>

<ul>
<p>1. 

The first question I would prefer a percentage of 5

percent. Most of my classmates and friends just don&#146;t need to resort to proxy.

They just view the major websites in China, which would comply with government

and have no risk of shut down. </p>

<p>2. 

It is difficult to view blocked site as for the low speed

and inconvenience. So rarely would we use those proxy unless the information is

important. </p>

<p>3. 

Blocked sites are usually consisting of those types:

blogs, TaiWan [sic] media, oversea community criticizing Chinese policy. Chinese

Internet users tend to focus on some entertainment like online game and chat,

rather than some serious subject. So generally those blocked sites had a

limited impact. But for someone who are seeking those information it is very

annoying.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><font size="1"><sup>26</sup></font></a></p>
</ul>

<p>This is just one example of many conversations with Chinese

Internet users illustrating why Chinese users are not currently using available

technologies to circumvent the Internet. Thus, the Great Firewall, while not

infallible, is successful enough to keep Chinese public opinion in line. And

without a doubt, multinational companies are playing a significant part in

preventing Chinese Internet users from stumbling across information that the

Chinese government would prefer they did not know existed. </p>

<p>This collaboration with political censorship also appears to

run contrary to the wishes of the Chinese people. According to the 2005 CASS

Internet survey, the majority of Chinese Internet users surveyed believed that

it was necessary for the government to control violent and pornographic content

on the Internet. However the study found that most users do not agree that

political content should be controlled, and only 12 percent felt that

controlling political content is a good idea.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><font size="1"><sup>27</sup></font></a> </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc142395821">5. Chinese and International Law</a></h2>

<p>China&#146;s Internet regulations may be among the most extensive

and restrictive in the world. At least twelve different government bureaus have

some authority over the Internet, including the powerful State Council

Information Office, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of

Information Industry, which is in charge of the licensing and registration of

all Internet content providers.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><font size="1"><sup>28</sup></font></a>

In 2001, Human Rights Watch estimated that the Chinese government had issued

more than sixty sets of government Internet regulations;<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><font size="1"><sup>29</sup></font></a> many new regulations

have been issued since then, all of them increasing government control. The

extensive national-level framework is only part of the picture: the

national-level regulations coexist with an unknown number of provincial- and local-level

implementing regulations, guidelines, policy documents, and other instruments

that have legal impact. Regulations in recent years have focused on, among

other things, expanding government censorship and control, both to new

technology, such as cellphones,<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><font size="1"><sup>30</sup></font></a>

and to new mediums of expression, like blogs.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><font size="1"><sup>31</sup></font></a> </p>

<p>Although not all regulations are enforced against every

possible individual or entity arguably in violation of the rules&#150;&#150;to do so

would be almost impossible, given the breadth and vagueness of certain

provisions&#150;&#150;nonetheless the legal framework does have a significant and

immediate impact on the amount of information available online, and the extent

to which the Internet can be used as a vehicle for free expression by

individual Chinese. </p>

<p>One of the most recent sets of regulations to be issued by

the government is the Provisions on the Administration of Internet News

Information Services (Provisions on News Information Services), issued jointly

by the State Council Information Office (SCIO) and the Ministry of Information

Industry in September 2005. The Provisions cover the creation and management of

news websites, and are the first new regulations on news websites since the

issuance of the Interim Provision on the Administration of Internet Web Sites

Engaged in News Posting Operations in 2000.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><font size="1"><sup>32</sup></font></a> Because the Provisions make use of a

variety of control methods, including registration requirements, external

government supervision, broad-based content restrictions, and administrative

penalties for violation of any part of the Provisions, they are fairly

representative. The Provisions also make repeated reference to restrictions

found in other relevant regulations, thus fully integrating China&#146;s Internet law and assuring that virtually all restrictions apply to all situations. </p>

<p>In the first section, the Provisions on News Information

Services make clear that the purpose of news websites is not to inform the

public of the facts, but instead to &#147;serve socialism&#148; and to &#147;safeguard the

nation&#146;s interests and the public interest.&#148;<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"><font size="1"><sup>33</sup></font></a> News with content that does not &#147;serve

socialism&#148; is banned.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><font size="1"><sup>34</sup></font></a>

News websites are &#147;encouraged&#148; to disseminate news that is &#147;healthy&#148; and &#147;civilized,&#148;

and that will &#147;rais(e) the quality of the nation.&#148;<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"><font size="1"><sup>35</sup></font></a> </p>

<p>The key content restriction provision is Article 19, which forbids

the following content: </p>
<ul>
<p>(1) violating the basic principles as they are confirmed

in the Constitution; </p>

<p>(2) jeopardizing the security of the nation, divulging

state secrets, subverting of the national regime or jeopardizing the integrity

of the nation&#146;s unity; </p>


<p>(3) harming the honor or the interests of the nation; </p>

<p>(4) inciting hatred against peoples, racism against

peoples, or disrupting the solidarity of peoples; </p>

<p>(5) disrupting national policies on religion, propagating

evil cults and feudal superstitions; </p>

<p>(6) spreading rumors, disturbing social order, or

disrupting social stability; </p>

<p>(7) spreading obscenity, pornography, gambling, violence,

terror, or abetting the commission of a crime; </p>

<p>(8) insulting or defaming third parties, infringing on

the legal rights and interests of third parties; </p>

<p>(9) inciting illegal assemblies, associations, marches,

demonstrations, or gatherings that disturb social order; </p>

<p>(10) conducting activities in the name of an illegal

civil organization; and </p>

<p>(11) any other content prohibited by law or rules.</p>
</ul>

<p>Prior Chinese government censorship practices suggest the

effect of Article 19 extends well beyond the narrow band of information that

might truly incite hatred or disturb social order. Instead, such provisions are

implemented in a way to prohibit all reporting that reflects a line different

from the official government position, or contains information that the

government deems too embarrassing, or is too candid in its discussion of

particularly entrenched social problems.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36"><font size="1"><sup>36</sup></font></a> </p>

<p>Equally important are the registration requirements created

by the Provisions. In general, news information websites must be part of the

official media system, and must register with the government in order to begin

operation. The Provisions envision a system in which most news websites are

extensions of currently-existing news units, although the provisions do allow

for a situation in which a non-News Work Unit can establish a new site. Such

websites are not permitted to do their own reporting, and are instead limited

to reprinting news stories generated by other media outlets.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"><font size="1"><sup>37</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Permission to create a news information website is granted

by the SCIO, or, in some cases, the information office at the provincial level.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"><font size="1"><sup>38</sup></font></a> The requirements

for setting up a news website are significant: the applicant must be a legal

person, must meet certain staffing and equipment requirements, and must have a

clean slate in terms of prior violations of relevant Internet rules.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><font size="1"><sup>39</sup></font></a> Cash-poor

startups are also not allowed: all applicant organizations must have registered

capital of no less than RMB10,000,000 (roughly U.S.$1.25 million).<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><font size="1"><sup>40</sup></font></a> </p>

<p>The Provisions also create clear legal authority to engage

in extensive supervision of news websites. Under Article 4 of the Provisions,

supervisory authority is shared by the SCIO and the provincial government

information offices. Both the SCIO and the relevant provincial government

information office are empowered to carry out &#147;on-site inspections&#148; of the

entities set up under the provisions,<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"><font size="1"><sup>41</sup></font></a>

and can carry out an &#147;examination&#148; of the entity if it is deemed necessary to

do so.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"><font size="1"><sup>42</sup></font></a>

</p>

<p>Finally, the penalties laid out in the Provisions are

significant. Websites that carry news they are not authorized to carry&#151;news

stories produced by their own staff, for example&#150;&#150;can be fined anywhere from

RMB10,000 to RMB30,000 (U.S.$1,250-3,750); if the circumstances of the

infraction are &#147;severe,&#148; then the website can be shut down.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"><font size="1"><sup>43</sup></font></a> Article 27 applies same

fines to acts of posting material that contains content prohibited by Article

19. There are no provisions on reduced liability for content that has already

been published in another official media source, which means that news websites

have to make an independent judgment as to whether news material is within the

broad confines of Article 19; the fact that the story has already been

published elsewhere, and therefore presumably approved by the authorities,

provides no legal cover. </p>

<p>The broad content restrictions found in Chinese Internet law

and reiterated by the Provisions are impossible to reconcile with the free

speech protections found in international law. Article 19 of the International

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) states that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression;

this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and

ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in

print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><font size="1"><sup>44</sup></font></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although the Internet is a new medium, the fact that online

speech is covered by the ICCPR and other relevant human rights instruments is

reflected in the January 1999 comments of then-UN special rapporteur on the

protection and promotion of freedom of opinion and expression, Abid Hussein: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As regards the impact of new information technology on

the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur

considers it of pre-eminent importance that they be considered in light of the

same international standards as other means of communication and that no

measures be taken which would unduly restrict freedom of expression and

information; in case of doubt, the decision should be in favour of free

expression and flow of information. With regard to the Internet, the Special

Rapporteur wishes to reiterate that on-line expression should be guided by

international standards and be guaranteed the same protection as is awarded to

other forms of expression.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"><font size="1"><sup>45</sup></font></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Under international law, governments are allowed to restrict

the free flow of information to protect certain narrowly determined interests

such as national security or public morals. But any decision to limit or

restrict access to information should comport with international standards for

protecting the right to information. Prior censorship in particular is severely

disfavored in international law, and not permitted in many constitutional

systems. A decision to block access to online material should be subject to the

highest level of scrutiny, with a burden on the government to demonstrate that

censorship would effectively avert a threat of irreparable, imminent, and

weighty harm, and that less extreme measures are unavailable as alternatives to

protect the state interest at issue. At present, it seems apparent that China engages in no such scrutiny, and instead censors an immense amount of material that

poses no threat to security whatsoever. The decision to censor certain material

is often unreviewable, just as the decision to punish certain online speakers

merely for exercising their right to speak freely online is arbitrary and

unpredictable. </p>

<p>In addition to provisions that limit content and provisions

that place severe restrictions on who can and cannot gather and report news,

other Internet regulations go beyond granting broad oversight powers and

actually compel certain entities to enable themselves to spy on all Internet

users at all times. The Rules on Internet Security Protection Technology

Measures, issued by the Ministry of Public Security in December 2005, obligate

Internet Service Providers and work units that use certain technologies to

develop the capacity to track and record the movements of individuals using

their service to go online. Article 9(2) of the Rules, for example, creates a

legal obligation for ISPs to maintain the technological capability to &#147;record

and retain information content and time of dissemination for providers of news,

publishing, and electronic bulletin services.&#148; ISPs are required to keep

records on websurfers for up to sixty days.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><font size="1"><sup>46</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Regulations like these undercut the right to privacy of

Chinese web users. Freedom from arbitrary and unlawful interference with one&#146;s

privacy and correspondence is protected both under the Universal Declaration of

Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"><font size="1"><sup>47</sup></font></a> and applies

to electronic communications, including email and newsgroup postings, as well

as electronic forms of personal data retained about individuals. Interference

that is capricious, unjust or disproportionate would be &#147;arbitrary,&#148; as would

interference for a purpose inimical to the protection of human rights more

generally, such as inhibiting peaceful dissent. States may not randomly or

freely intercept or monitor email or Internet usage.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48"><font size="1"><sup>48</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the treaty body

that is an authoritative interpreter of state duties under the ICCPR, in a

General Comment on the right to privacy, has said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As all persons live in society, the protection of privacy

is necessarily relative. However, the competent public authorities should only

be able to call for such information relating to an individual&#146;s private life

the knowledge of which is essential in the interests of society as understood

under the Covenant. [&#133;] Even with regard to interferences that conform to the

Covenant, relevant legislation must specify in detail the precise circumstances

in which such interferences may be permitted. A decision to make use of such

authorized interference must be made only by the authority designated under the

law, and on a case-by-case basis. [&#133;.]</p> </blockquote>

<p>By requiring ISPs to maintain the capability to read the

communications of individuals communicating online, and even to be able to keep

records of which websites individual netizens choose to visit, the Chinese government

is seriously infringing on the privacy rights of its own people. As with

violations of freedom of expression discussed above, no particularized

determination is made; rather <i>all</i> users are subject to scrutiny. </p>

<p>In addition to the Internet regulations themselves, there

are many broader structural problems with China&#146;s legal system that prevent the

emergence of a more liberal Internet law regime. One key stumbling block to

improved Internet regulation in China is the absence of any enforceable norms

against which Internet regulations can be measured. Although the Chinese

constitution explicitly protects the right to free expression, the right to

privacy, and the right to engage in academic research,<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"><font size="1"><sup>49</sup></font></a> the constitution itself

is not directly enforceable, and therefore regulations that clearly violate

these rights escape any form of judicial scrutiny. </p>

<p>The overall institutional weakness and lack of independence

of Chinese courts also plays a key role. Because most courts in China receive the majority of their funding from the local government,<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"><font size="1"><sup>50</sup></font></a> they are often unable or

unwilling to deliver a verdict contrary to the local expectations, especially

in politically sensitive cases. Courts are also subject to both government and

Communist Party authority, and must please both masters.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"><font size="1"><sup>51</sup></font></a> This lack of

independence stifles any legal creativity on the part of judges that might

otherwise limit the scope or effect of Internet regulations. </p>

<p>Finally, once an individual has been arrested and charged

with a criminal offense in relation to his or her use of the Internet, the

serious shortcomings of the criminal justice system in China come into play. Mechanisms for protecting key basic rights, including the right to a fair

trial, the right to legal counsel, and the right to presumption of innocence,

have yet to be fully integrated into the Chinese legal system,<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"><font size="1"><sup>52</sup></font></a> which means that an

individual arrested for violating any laws relating to the Internet that carry

criminal penalties will find it difficult to obtain a fair trial. </p>

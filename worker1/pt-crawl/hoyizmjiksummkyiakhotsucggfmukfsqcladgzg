<li> why Roman numerals?! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY!! Justin Pugliese (2016)</li>
<li> Just figure out Roman Numerals. It really isn't that hard unless you are a total idiot? Joel Clause Justin Pugliese (2018)</li>
<li> Next they'll be in Spanish???? or Arabic? Mind boggling Justin Pugliese (2020)</li>
<li>Same here. They re nervewreckin. Hait Tien (Hot Teen) Justin Pugliese (2020)<br>
</li>
<li>o prevent confusion between the winner's year. If a team wins in Feb 2017, did they win the 2016 season ending in 2017 or did they win 2017? Prvnsmn Justin Pugliese (2016)</li>
<li> 2016 Season. Sadly, Mr. Brady won. Cash Co. Prvnsmn (2016)</li>
<li> Guess you'll be weeping again this year. Another comeback against the Striped Cats. They just have something against Birds and Animals in head to head confrontations. Read this and Weep some more. Jkm49 Cash Co. (2017)</li>
<li> or did they win in 2017, and the 2017 Season actually starts in August of 2017, with the regular season really starting in September 2017. and the 2017 season goes to December of 2017, and the Super Bowl of 2017 is actually plays in February of 2018, but it's really for the 2017 season, so actually this is the super-bowl for the 2016 season, and Matt Ryan actually won the MVP for the 2016 season, so Brady won the Super-Bowl for the 2016 season? Right? EddieGin12 Prvnsmn (2016)
<ul>
<li> I agree it is a little confusing. I have added a note to indicate that the year listed is for when the Super Bowl game is played, which is actually for the regular season of the previous year. Rob Admin Prvnsmn (2016)</li>
<li> The SB is part of the previous year of that schedule. It has nothing to do with the year the SB/playoffs are played. If that's the case, then Football season should start in July, so the playoffs and SB could be done by Dec of the same year. Before the Panthers/Jaguars, or expansion teams joined in 1995, there were only 14 scheduled games. Playoffs were done by end of Dec of the same year and SB was the second week of Jan, the following year. Since they joined, more games have been added to their schedule and thus pushed the playoffs/SB further into the next year. Go Falcons! Mark1957 Rob (2016)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sec1968 mark1957 (2017)<br>
The 16 game regular season schedule has been in effect since the 1978 season. The only real change has been adding in a bye week, adding a 17th week to the season and pushing everything back 1 week.</li>
<li>Phil Vent New England Patriots #1 Fan (2016)<br>
There shouldn't be any problem .. Last four games against the Falcons were won by the Patriots, and two of those games were with QB Ryan.. Brady has never lost a game EVER against the Falcons.. Two much hype on the Falcons number one offence but Patriots number one defence and good defences in general always pull off the win.. Don't sweat it ...</li>
<li>Donald Forbes Phil Vent (2016)<br>
You always sweat the Super Bowl. Anything can happen.</li>
<li>Phil Vent Donald Forbes (2016)<br>
Yes, your right .. I can't believe the Patriots spotted them 25 points before they went to work ..</li>
<li>Unclealfie Phil Vent (2017)<br>
Can't ever underestimate the Pats with the greatest QB to ever play the game, along with the best coach ever!</li>
<li>Luke unclealfie (2017)<br>
No bomb brady and the deflatriots really let the air out of their skill this year</li>
<li>Kenneth lytle roger gibson (2017)<br>
good luck. Should be another country song</li>
<li>Asdf6654 (2014)<br>
needed this for trivia crack.</li>
<li>Flyinfreddy (2020)<br>
Don't forget, the Super Bowl became the &quot;Annual championship game of the
National Football League&quot; beginning with #5 (#V); before that it was
between the NFL champ and the AFL champ. In 1970 the NFL absorbed the
AFL and 3 original NFL teams (Steelers, Colts, Browns [later Ravens] ) moved to the new AFC to even out the conferences.</li>
<li>Trena Reese (2020)<br>
thy I need this for my project</li>
<li>George Ford (2019)<br>
It drives me crazy when a list like this can't even get the basics right. Super Bowl I was the 1966 Champions not 1967. New England just won the last Super Bowl for the 2018 Season. When we think if the 2 best all time defenses it's the 1985 Bears and 2000 Ravens. Their Super Bowl games were played in 1986 and 2001 respectily.<br>
<ul>
<li>Rob Admin George Ford (2019)<br>
I know it is confusing. It could be listed wither way, the year that the final game was played or the year most of the regular games were played. That's why I have written that &quot;the years listed indicate the year the Super Bowl was played, the regular season is played during the year before&quot;. Maybe you skipped that and went straight to the list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>John Varga (2019)<br>
patriots have won 6 and been in 11!!! i hate them</li>
<li>Sam (2018)<br>
i can't find what i need!!!!!! And this is a school project</li>
<li>James Giordano (2017)<br>
Now you gotta add the EAGLES</li>
<li>Lawrence Lakel (2017)<br>
This listing is very helpful, especially settling discussions.</li>
<li>12th Man (2017)<br>
Had the Seattle Seahawks gone to SB XVII &amp; not the Raiders, i think the stunning outfits that the Sea Gals wore would of boosted CBS' ratings. Would of worked for an overnight with one of them, perhaps one named Debye.</li>
<li>Ben Samsin (2016)<br>
lol just found out that Buffalo lost 4 times in a row from 1991, to 1994 LOL</li>
<li>John Van Dan Ben Samsin (2017)<br>
True, but no other team, win or lose can say they were to the super bowl 4 years in a row.</li>
<li>EddieGin12 (2016)<br>
It's over Tom Terrific Brady is the Best QB of all TIME. Go back to the Hospital and change his birth Certificate Tom Terrific is a living saint, Blessed by GOD himself.</li>

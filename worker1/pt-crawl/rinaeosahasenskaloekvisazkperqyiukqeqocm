		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to William Maxwell's masterpiece,<i> So Long, 
		See You Tomorrow</i> (1980), which was also his next-to-last book, the central 
		characters of his Lincoln-related work are based on his family because 
	those were the people he knew best and whose experiences he could most 
		readily write about. In <i>So Long</i>, Maxwell uses an introspective, 
		autobiographical first-person narrator and a character based on his 
		brief, late-childhood friendship with a white farm boy, fictionally named Cletus Smith. 
		In writing about the Smiths, Maxwell was expanding the scope of his 
		material to include those he knew only marginally. Maxwell confides that he did a lot of reading to try to 
		understand Midwestern farm life in preparation for writing about the 
		Smiths. </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		In his last book, <i>Billie Dyer and Other 
		Stories </i>(1992), Maxwell continues to write about his family, 
		himself, and people who had been in the margins of his experience in 
		Lincoln. The central figure of &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; is Maxwell's Uncle 
		Ted Blinn. The central figures of &quot;My Father's Friends&quot; are Aaron 
		McGivor and John Dean Gillett Hill, a Lincoln attorney from a 
		distinguished, upper-middle-class family. The Gillett family was 
		independently wealthy from owning thousands of acres of rich farmland in 
		Logan County around Elkhart, south of Lincoln. The 
		central figure of &quot;The Holy Terror&quot; is Maxwell's older brother, Edward 
		(&quot;Happy&quot; or &quot;Hap&quot;). </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two longest narratives of <i>Billie Dyer 
		and Other Stories</i> are the title piece, &quot;Billie Dyer&quot; (34 pages), and &quot;The Front and 
		the Back Parts of the House&quot; (14 pages). The central figures of 
		these stories are blacks. Maxwell opens the book with &quot;Billie Dyer,&quot; and 
		&quot;The Front and the Back Parts of the House&quot; is the next-to-last story. The central figure of &quot;Billie 
		Dyer&quot; is William Dyer, M.D., a native of Lincoln and graduate of 
		Lincoln College who became prominent as 
		one of this nation's first black physicians. The central figures of &quot;The 
		Front and the Back Parts of the House&quot; are the autobiographical narrator 
		and Hattie Dyer Brummell, a sister of Dr. Dyer who had been employed as a cook and 
		housekeeper by Maxwell's parents, Maxwell's maternal grandparents, and 
		his Aunt Annette (Blinn) Bates. Members of the Dyer-Brummell 
		black family of Lincoln lived on Elm Street just a half block from Maxwell's 
		parents and his maternal grandparents, the Edward Dunallen Blinns. 
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Dyer-Brummell family ancestors were former 
		slaves. William and Hattie's paternal grandfather was Aaron Dyer, who had lived in Springfield, 
		Illinois, and who had been active in the Underground Railroad. The 
		Dyer-Brummell family also helped to found and build the 1868 Allen 
		Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) that still stands at the 
		corner of Broadway and Sherman Streets.&nbsp; </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of blacks in Lincoln, Illinois, is 
		an important part of its social history. This black history, however, 
		has not been very thoroughly written and is reported in only a few 
		sources. Two sources of significance to Lincoln's social history for 
		their black characters are Maxwell's novel titled <i>Time Will Darken It</i> 
		(1948) and his last publication, <i>Billie Dyer and Other Stories</i> 
		(1992). </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Knowing the Dyer-Brummell family members only from childhood experience, Maxwell had limited involvement with them and, of course, 
		limited powers of observation and memory of them. In writing about 
		these blacks, Maxwell did not rely on memory alone, but conducted 
		research, and he mentions that research in his stories. <b>During 2007, 
		I investigated Maxwell's research into this black family and discovered 
		that his stories mention only a small part of the research he did</b>. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay examines Maxwell's research on the Dyer-Brummell families 
		and describes my own corresponding research findings. My research has involved 
		communication with Ms. Debbie Ross, the adopted daughter of John A. 
		Ross. As explained in this essay, he was a grade school black classmate 
		of Maxwell, and Maxwell corresponded with him in the 1980s, attempting 
		to learn more about the Dyer-Brummell family. Maxwell was seeking 
		information to help him write about Dr. Dyer and his sister, Hattie Dyer 
		Brummell. Ms. Priscilla Florence is a granddaughter of Hattie 
		Dyer Brummell, and this essay greatly benefits from Ms. Florence's 
		insightful remembrances of Lincoln, Illinois, and details of her 
		family's history and its connections to William Maxwell. <b>This essay 
		quotes previously unpublished letters to and from Maxwell 
		generously provided by Debbie Ross and Priscilla Florence.</b> This essay also 
		discusses 
	Maxwell's portrayal of blacks in his final stories and draws some 
	conclusions about his literary art based on those black characters.</p>

		<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Discussion of &quot;Billie Dyer&quot;</font></b></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The title figure in &quot;Billie Dyer&quot; was the son of Alfred and Laura Ward 
		Dyer. Although both Mr. and Mrs. Dyer worked for the Maxwell family, 
		Maxwell writes that &quot;as far as I knew I had never laid eyes on William 
		Dyer&quot; (&quot;Billie Dyer,&quot; p. 5). In his effort to gain information about 
		William Dyer, M.D., Maxwell talked to one of his brothers. I assume this 
		was the younger brother, Blinn, not the older one, Edward, who died in 
		1985, perhaps before Maxwell began work on &quot;Billie Dyer.&quot; Maxwell also 
		talked to the President of Lincoln College, who had been a childhood friend of 
		Maxwell in Bloomington, Illinois, where Maxwell's Aunt Edith lived with 
		her medical doctor husband. Maxwell does not name this man, but my 
		research shows that he was Raymond Dooley. William Dyer had attended 
		Lincoln College, which gave him an award in approximately 1955, and most 
		likely Raymond Dooley was responsible for that recognition.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		A central primary source Maxwell uses and summarizes is Dr. Dyer's World 
		War I diary. Other primary sources cited by Maxwell in &quot;Billie Dyer&quot; are a few letters &quot;written between 1955 
	and 1957&quot; by Dr. Dyer to Maxwell's cousin, Hugh Davis. &quot;Billie Dyer&quot; also 
	identifies several 
		secondary sources: the Logan County histories of 1878, 1911, and 1982; editions of the <i>Lincoln Evening Courier;</i> 
		and <i>The Namesake Town: A 
		Centennial History of Lincoln, Illinois</i> (1953).</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		&quot;Billie Dyer&quot; describes the 1975 discovery of William Dyer's WW I dairy 
		in Dallas, Texas, by Jim Wood, a real estate agent. Curious to learn 
		more about Dr. Dyer and his diary, Wood eventually wrote the Lincoln 
		Public Library of Lincoln, Illinois. Maxwell does not explain how he 
		accessed this diary, but implies that did so through the Lincoln 
		Public Library.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Maxwell describes the diary as &quot;a lined eight-by-twelve-inch copybook 
		[photocopy] with snapshots and portrait photographs and postcards pasted 
		in wherever they were appropriate. That it escaped the bonfire is 
		remarkable; that it fell into the hands of so conscientious a man is 
		also to be wondered at&quot; (&quot;Billie Dyer,&quot; p. 17). 
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		In an email message to me in October, 2007, Richard Sumrall, Director of the Lincoln Public Library, explained that the Library had 
		received a photocopy of the typescript of this diary, but the sender and 
		date of submission are presently unknown. This document was 
		apparently the source that Maxwell worked from, and his language in 
		describing the diary suggests that he believed there was only one copy. </p>
	<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	In a phone conversation I had with Dr. Dyer's great niece, Priscilla 
	Florence, in September, 2007, she explained that Dr. Dyer had self-published 
	his diary and had given copies to family members, but she knows of only one 
	or two surviving copies. In a later email to me, Ms. Florence 
		mentioned that her first cousin, Foster Whitfield, says he has the 
		original manuscript of Dr. Dyer's diary.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		In October of 2007, I was pleasantly surprised to see a copy of Dr. 
		Dyer's WW I diary for sale on eBay, and I purchased it. This copy is a 
		typeset, printed version measuring approximately five inches by eight 
		inches with a gold-colored cover and 63 glossy pages. The copy I have is titled &quot;A Soldiers' 
		[<i>sic</i>] Diary&quot; by First Lieutenant Wm. H. Dyer, M.D. This copy has 
		no date or place of publication, and these copies are rare: in several years of exploring used bookstores in central Illinois 
		and monitoring eBay for items relating to Lincoln, Illinois, I have never seen such a copy. </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		seller I purchased this copy from was living in Cleveland, Ohio, and he 
		wrote me that &quot;I bought it from an old friend who is now deceased. I 
		believe he bought it at a book store in Akron, Ohio, in the 1970's.&quot; Dr. 
		Dyer's brother, Clarence, had lived in Ohio, so perhaps there is a 
		connection. Inside the front cover is the inscription and signature: &quot;To 
		Mr. and Mrs. Horace Brown from Wm. H. Dyer M.D.&quot; I have found no 
		information about the Horace Browns.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pasted 
		inside the back cover of my copy of Dr. Dyer's diary are two newspaper articles. The newspaper(s) 
		is/are unidentified, but the text indicates the publisher(s) is/are not

		<i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photo of Dr. William Dyer from the newspaper article about his

		<b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Discussion of &quot;The Front 
		and the Back Parts of the House&quot;</font></b><p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		In &quot;The Front and the Back Parts of the House,&quot; Maxwell says that his 
		puzzling encounter with Hattie Dyer took place during a visit he made to 
		Lincoln to see his family when he said he was in his early forties (p. 
		83), but it is difficult to reconcile this estimate of his age at the 
		time of the visit with other facts. The visit during which Maxwell 
		experienced Hattie's snub would have had to be after 1948, when <i>Time 
		Will Darken It</i> was published (the novel whose black character 
		offended Hattie), and before 1958, when his father died. Maxwell says he 
		was living in the country when his father requested the visit (p. 83). 
		According to Christopher Carduff's chronology, Maxwell and Emily lived 
		in a New York City brownstone apartment on East 36th Street at Lexington 
		Avenue from 1949 to 1955, with weekends and holidays spent at their 
		country Yorktown Heights &quot;small, sturdy house&quot; (<i>William Maxwell: 
		Later Novels and Stories</i>, p. 953).&nbsp; In 1955, Maxwell and his 
		wife took up full-time residency in Yorktown Heights (p. 955). Did the 
		visit to Lincoln during which he experienced Hattie's snub occur in 
		1955+? If so, Maxwell would have been in his late forties, not his early 
		forties. Whenever the visit occurred, Maxwell would have been married, 
		but the narrator of &quot;House&quot; does not indicate that both his wife and he 
		made that visit to Lincoln.<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The encounter 
		with Hattie occurred in the home of his Aunt Annette Blinn 
		Bates on Lincoln Avenue. Maxwell writes that &quot;years passed without my thinking about 
		Hattie Dyer at all, then suddenly there I was backing away from her in 
		confusion&quot; (p. 92). As indicated on her headstone (pictured later on 
	this page), Hattie Dyer Brummell passed away in 1963. Perhaps Maxwell did 
		not begin to seek information about her until the mid 1980s, after he 
		had published his major work, <i>So Long, See You Tomorrow</i> (1980) 
		and began to concentrate on the material of <i>Billie Dyer and Other Stories
		</i>(1992). 
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		In &quot;Billie Dyer,&quot; Maxwell does not indicate that he attempted to go 
		beyond the sources named or suggested in the story in order to 
		gain more information about the Dyer-Brummell families, but he does make 
		such a revelation in &quot;The Front and the Back Parts of the House.&quot; As 
		Maxwell considered how he could find out more about Hattie Dyer Brummell, 
		he writes that &quot;I could have asked my aunt [Annette Blinn Bates] and she 
		would have told me all that a white person would be likely to know, but 
		I didn't. More years passed. I found that I had a nagging curiosity 
		about Hattie--about what her life had been like. Finally it occurred to 
		me that my Cousin Tom Perry, who lives in Lincoln, might be able to 
		learn about her&quot; (<i>Billie Dyer and Other Stories</i>, p. 99).<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The 
		Front and the Back Parts of the House&quot; includes a quote from the second 
		letter Maxwell's step-cousin, Tom Perry, wrote to him on this matter: 
		&quot;'I don't understand it. . . . The colored people of Lincoln have always 
		been very open. If you asked one of them a question you got the answer. 
		This is different. They don't seem to want to talk about Hattie Dyer.'&quot; 
		Maxwell continues, &quot;In a P.S. he added that the elderly black man who 
		took care of his yard was reading one of his books. Miss Lucy Jane Purrington, whose 
		yard he also looked after, had lent it to him, and in a flash I realized 
		what the unforgivable thing was and who had done it&quot; (p. 102). 
	<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maxwell's 
		epiphany is that he is the one who had offended Hattie. He realizes 
		that she must have discovered the unsympathetic black characters in his 
		1948 novel, <i>Time Will Darken It</i>, that correspond to her husband 
		and her: &quot;If Hattie did indeed read my book then what could she think 
		but that I had portrayed her as a loose woman and her husband as a 
		monster of evil? And people in Lincoln, colored people and white, would 
		wonder if I knew things about Fred Brummell that they didn't, and if he 
		was not the person they took him for. I had exposed their married life 
		and blackened his character in order to make a fortune from my writing&quot; 
		(p. 107).
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Prior to the preceding passage, Maxwell writes, &quot;When I was working on 
		the novel about the Kings, it did not occur to me that Hattie would read 
		it or even know it existed. A few women who had known me as a child 
		would put their names on the waiting list at the Lincoln Public Library, 
		one or two at the most might buy it, is what I thought. Men didn't read 
		books. The <i>Evening Courier</i> and the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> 
		supplied them with all the reading matter they required&quot; (p. 106).<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> 
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">
		<a name="maxwellandjohnaross"></a>William Maxwell and John A. Ross</font></b><p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		&quot;The elderly black man&quot; who took care of Tom Perry's yard plays a key 
		role in Maxwell's self-discovery. Most likely, the real-life counterpart 
		of this elderly black man was John A. Ross, a life-long resident of 
		Lincoln, Illinois. Early in 2007, my friend Bobby Olson of Springfield, 
		Illinois, told me that he had known John A. Ross and that Mr. Ross had a 
		daughter in Springfield, Illinois. I found her name and email address on 
		the Internet. After several email exchanges and phone conversations with 
		her, I interviewed Ms. Ross on August 17, 2007, at the Abraham Lincoln 
		Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois. At that time, she 
		confirmed that her father had done yard work for Tom Perry and others in 
		his family.&nbsp; 
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Note</i>: Ms. Ross is the 
		founder and lead singer of the blues band named The Debbie Ross Band of 
		Springfield, Illinois. She sang <i>The Star-Spangled Banner</i> at the 
		old State Capitol in Springfield when Barack Obama announced his 
		Presidential candidacy there. In Sources Cited below, see link to The 
		Debbie Ross Band Web site and to a YouTube video of Ms. Ross singing the 
		national anthem at the Obama announcement.) 
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<b>Curiously, Maxwell does not identify the &quot;elderly black man,&quot; let alone 
		reveal that he was Maxwell's classmate and friend. Nor does Maxwell 
		explain that he had corresponded with Mr. Ross in an effort to learn 
		more about Hattie and her family.</b> Maxwell perhaps does not identify &quot;the 
		elderly black man&quot; because Mr. Ross was a personal acquaintance of Maxwell, and 
		Maxwell did not want to seem to exploit him as Hattie apparently thought 
		Maxwell had done with his portrayal of her husband.<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		According to an article in the Bloomington <i>Pantagraph</i> of 1993 by 
		Elaine Graybill, John A. Ross and Lincoln author William Maxwell 
		attended Lincoln High School in the same freshman class of 1922. 
		Maxwell's family then moved to Chicago, so the freshman year was the 
		last time that Ross and Maxwell saw one another, although they corresponded over the years. </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Ross says Maxwell encouraged him to read: &quot;He [Maxwell] introduced me to 
		reading. He loaned me a copy of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. That was the 
		first book I ever read&quot; [in the eighth grade].</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Ross says he then began to visit the Lincoln Public Library: &quot;I learned 
		to read all stuff. I read some of everything.&quot; Ross said he read all of 
		Maxwell's books and has read novels by other authors.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The <i>Pantagraph</i> article says that &quot;after graduating from Lincoln 
		High School, Ross attended Lincoln University, now Lincoln College, 
		about six months, until he ran out of money.&quot;</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		&quot;Ross's career consisted of farm and janitorial work, and 29 years at 
		Caterpillar's foundry. He worked for Maxwell's aunt, Annette Bates. 'I 
		worked around the Maxwell family all my life.'&quot;</p>

		Debbie Ross enjoys returning to Lincoln to visit family and friends.<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debbie Ross provided me with copies of 
		four letters that her father had received from Maxwell from November, 
		1986, to December, 1991. Maxwell's letter to John A. Ross of January 7, 1987, mentions that Mr. 
		Ross had also done yard work for Maxwell's Aunt Annette's husband 
		[William Bates], and this letter explicitly asks John A. Ross for 
		information about the Dyer-Brummell families: 
		<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<b>Right now I am trying to write a 
		story about the family of Alfred Dyer [father of Dr. William and Hattie] 
		and I waited too long to ask people about them. They lived on Elm Street 
		between 8th and 9th Street, and his daughter Hattie cooked for my mother 
		when I was a child. His son William was chosen in 1953 as one of the 10 most distinguished figures in the history of Lincoln. Like 
		you, they were part Indian, part white and part Negro. I know that 
		Alfred Dyer had 5 children, but I cannot even find out what the names of 
		all of them were, let alone what happened to them. And after the story 
		is published you don't, of course, have a second chance. Did you know any 
		of them? They would be perhaps 20 or 30 years older than you. Is there 
		anybody that you know in Lincoln besides yourself who can remember 
		things that far back? I would be so grateful for anything you can tell 
		me</b>.&quot;<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently John A. Ross was unable to provide Maxwell with much, if any, 
	information about Hattie and her family. In Maxwell's letter to Ross of 
	October 24, 1987, Maxwell writes, 
		<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<b>It was kind of you to remember my 
		interest in Hattie Dyer. I don't suppose now I will ever find out what I 
		was hoping to, and will just have to put the story aside. She worked for 
		my mother when I was a small child, and I met her again once thirty 
		years later, in my Aunt's house on Lincoln Avenue. I should have asked 
		her then what her life had been like, but you don't know at one time in 
		your life what you will want to know at another. She was a very nice, 
		quiet, capable woman, and my mother thought the world of her</b>.&quot;<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	When Maxwell lacked as much factual information as he wanted, he sometimes 
	used his imagination to create scenes built on the facts 
		he did have. One example of Maxwell's use of his imagination for this 
		purpose occurs in &quot;Billie Dyer,&quot; in which Maxwell invents an account of 
		William Dyer's childhood friendship with John Harts and how it could 
		have led John's father, David H. Harts, Sr., to provide financial 
		support for William's education. (Access more information about
		Civil War Captain
		<a target="_blank" href="foleyhouse.html#dyerbenefactors">David H. Harts, 
		Sr., as 
		William Dyer's benefactor</a>.)<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Maxwell's letter to John A. Ross of October 24, 1987, includes a most 
		interesting passage in which Maxwell imagines what he does not actually 
		know about Hattie Dyer Brummell's life:<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"> 
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>&quot;<b>Storytellers are like fortunetellers, in reverse, because they peer 
		at the past instead of at the future. What I think is that in 1918, 
		reluctantly (because she didn't want to leave her father and mother, who 
		were old) she moved to Chicago because her husband thought he could do 
		better for himself there. And it turned out that he was right. They both 
		worked. She had had enough of housekeeping and so she went to an 
		employment agency and ended up with a job as a cleaning woman in a 
		hospital or office building. The work was hard but the pay was much 
		better than she had been used to. And life in Chicago more expensive 
		than it had been in Lincoln, but also more full of variety. Between 
		them, she and her husband had enough and they lived comfortably in a 
		walkup on the South Side, and she got to be friends with the woman whose 
		back porch adjoined hers. When the Depression came he was laid off, but 
		she still made enough at the hospital for them to scrimp by, and he kept 
		hoping to find work but didn't, and so when old Mrs. Dyer took sick they 
		decided to give up and go back to Lincoln so Hattie could take care of 
		her. I have made all of this up. Do you think any of it is likely to be 
		true?</b>&quot;<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; line-height:150%"> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The preceding passage was composed four years before the publication of 
		&quot;The Front and the Back Parts of the House&quot; in <i>The 
		New Yorker. </i>The appearance of &quot;Billie Dyer&quot; in <i>The New Yorker</i> 
		was the first publication of that story before it appeared 
		in <i>Billie Dyer and Other Stories</i> the following year, but <b>surprisingly the 
		&quot;storytellers are like fortunetellers&quot; passage is not included in the 
		published story.</b><p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> 
		<font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reading 
		Maxwell's letters to John A. Ross, I wondered whether Maxwell's papers 
		at the University of Illinois might include Ross's letters. Maxwell's 
		letter to Ross of January 7, 1987, indicates that Ross had written to 
		tell of his life, and I wanted to see that autobiographical information. In 
		an email to me of September 5, 2007, I received the following statement from Professor Alvan 
		Bregman, Rare Book Collections Librarian at the U of I: &quot;Dear 
		Professor Henson: I am sorry to disappoint you, but there do not seem to 
		be any letters from John A. Ross in our Maxwell correspondence.&nbsp;I've 
		checked not only the databases, but also the correspondence files 
		themselves.&nbsp;If I do ever happen to come across such letters, I will let 
		you know.&quot;</font><p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> 
		<font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I have also attempted to gain more information about the Dyer-Brummell 
		families through my own research, and thanks to the Internet, I 
		discovered information that was unavailable to Mr. Maxwell. Early in 2007 I emailed [Lincoln] <i>Courier</i> 
		reporter Nancy Rollings Saul because I knew she was interested in the 
		black history of Lincoln, Illinois, especially in Aaron Dyer's 
		involvement in the Underground Railroad. As a long shot, I asked Ms. Saul if she might 
		have a photo of Hattie Dyer Brummell so I might add it to this community 
		history Web site. </font>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> 
		<font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms. Saul sent me 
		the remarkable Dyer-Brummell family 
		photo that appears below, and she also sent me additional 
		information that she obtained when she attended a Dyer-Brummelll family 
		reunion in Decatur, Illinois, in August of 2002. That information 
		included the names of Hattie Brummell's children in attendance; a 
		photo of one her daughters, Mrs. Marian Louis Clay; some biographical details about 
		Mrs. Clay; and the names of Mrs. Clay's children. <br>

		Using Internet searching with one of those names, I located and phoned 
		Ms. Frankye Clay Parham, who later told her older sister, Ms. Priscilla Florence, 
		about my interest in their family. Ms. Florence phoned me, and during conversation with me 
		in early September, 2007, we discussed the separation of Hattie and her 
		husband, George. Priscilla Florence said that Hattie's 
		husband, George Brummell, was somewhat rootless. 
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		In emails of January, 2008, Ms. Florence explained that George had left his family 
		in Lincoln and had gone to Chicago. Ms. Florence is unsure why he did. 
		Her mother (Hattie's daughter, Marian) believes that George had 
		abandoned his family, but Ms. Florence adds her mother &quot;was a very young 
		girl then, and anyone who would know has been dead for decades. Gramma 
		Hattie left her kids with her mother [Laura Ward Dyer] at the home on 
		Elm Street to get her husband in Chicago. My mother only remembers 
		missing her very much at that time. She [Hattie] came back with him. 
		They stayed together until he died (in the Lincoln house on Elm Street, 
		according to cousin Harold, who was there at the time).&nbsp;George was very 
		ill with a weak heart for years and only able to shine shoes in Lincoln 
		when he felt well.&nbsp;I think that Gramma Hattie was the main wage earner.&quot; George Brummell is buried at his hometown of 
		Decatur.<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Ms. Florence has graciously provided me with additional information 
		about her family and its connections to Maxwell and Lincoln, Illinois. I 
		am most grateful to Nancy Rollings Saul for making it possible for me to 
		have found Ms. Florence and thus to obtain more information about this 
		remarkable family. Amazingly, many in this family like Dr. Dyer left 
		Lincoln for better opportunities, yet quite a few continue to be 
		somewhat close-knit. Ms. Florence communicates extensively with family 
		members, and many of them have offered insights and details that she has 
		shared with me.<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<a name="mrswhitfieldcomplaint"></a>Ms. Florence told me about her Aunt Helen 
		Brummell 
		Whitfield, one of Hattie's daughters (as previously noted, Helen is 
		sitting on the lap of 
		her grandmother in the Brummell family photo above). Mrs. Whitfield had written William Maxwell about his 
		portrayal of Hattie and her husband. Priscilla Florence kindly provided me with a copy of that typewritten letter and of 
		Maxwell's letter of reply. Mrs. Whitfield's letter is undated, but 
		probably was sent in the first half of 1992 because Maxwell's response letter is dated 
		July 10, 1992. 
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; line-height:150%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below is the full text of Mrs. Whitfield's letter, and I 
		have done some minor editing of spelling and punctuation, but I retain 
		Mrs. Whitfield's spelling of Brummel with one l. <u>This letter 
		is the only known written primary source that confirms Maxwell's 
		literary testimony that his portrayal of Hattie's husband had 
		upset her</u>:<br>

		of reading it. You see, my mother was not the only Lincolnite who 
		identified with the characters in your book.</b><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> 
		<b>Let me tell you about George Brummel, Fred as you called him. He was 
		a gentle man, dignified, bright and was never exposed to the horror of 
		slavery. He is buried in Decatur, Illinois (his home) not Lincoln. Your 
		description of my father was not pleasing to me.</b><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> 
		<b>My parents were very proud people, even though their backgrounds 
		varied. The Brummels settled in Decatur, Illinois from Europe. My 
		granduncle Robert Brummel lived in Indianapolis, and he claimed to be third 
		cousin to Beau Brummel, even had some proof.</b><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> 
		<b>I am to this day, sorry I did not learn more about the Brummel family 
		other than that their bloodline was Cherokee, French, English, and small 
		amount of African American. Cherokee is prominent in both sides of the 
		family. Grandma Dyer's mother was full blooded Cherokee Indian.</b><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> 
		<b>Let's go back to Mamma. My father died when I was 13 years of age. 
		Mamma was left with five children (at home) to raise. Do you know, we 
		had a meeting (called by Mamma) to decide how she would manage to feed, 
		cloth, etc., us, her very different children. Would we become recipients 
		of ADC? No, was echoed throughout the conversation. My mother decided 
		electric lights would be turned off and to be turned on when I finished 
		high school. I was beginning my freshman year, so for four years we had 
		kerosene lamps. The day I graduated the electric lights were turned on 
		(How wise my mother was).</b><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> 
		<b>My mother often told us we were of aristocracy (smile), and we really

		Lincoln that didn't have electricity for those four years, along with no 
		car, or any other luxury.</b><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> 
		<b>Many years passed but at some of our family gatherings we asked Mamma 
		why we had no lights as well as why she instilled the fact we were 
		aristocratic (rich in heritage, poor financially). We her children had 
		many blessed thoughts of Hattie and Fred Brummel. </b>
		<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> <b>I recall learning 
		many times about the Harts, Maxwells, Bliss </b>[Blinns]<b>, and Harris.

		Below is the entire text of Mr. Maxwell's letter of reply to Mrs. 
		Whitfield, dated July 10, 1992. Not surprisingly, the publishing-savvy 
		Maxwell opens with a conventional libel dodge of denying that his 
		characters are based on actual people.<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; ">

		would make sure this didn't happen. But it is a relief to me to know 
		that my guess about why your mother was not more friendly to me was 
		correct. I tried to put my arms around her because she represented the 
		world I had lost when my mother died, but I didn't manage to tell her 
		this, and she didn't manage to tell me why she was angry. Too bad. But 
		also a long time ago, and one must let go of things that happen.</b><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> 
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was writing &quot;The Front and Back Parts 
		of the House&quot; in <i>Billie Dyer and Other Stories</i>, I tried hard, for years, 
		to find out what your mother's life had been like but by that time she 
		had passed away and there didn't seem to be any people in Lincoln who 
		remembered her. </b>[<i>Note</i>: Contrast this language with that of &quot;The 
		Front and the Back Parts of the House&quot; in which Maxwell quotes his 
		cousin Tom Perry: &quot;They [black Lincolnites] don't seem to want to talk

		ask.</b><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; "> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		After the book was published I had a letter from a member of the family 
		on 8th Street that your mother worked for when she moved back to Lincoln 
		from Chicago. They said that one morning she came to work in tears 
		because your brother, who was, as I am sure you don't need to be told, a 
		remarkable athlete, wasn't allowed to eat in a cafe with the other boys 
		who were celebrating their victory but had to take his plate and go 
		outside and eat, sitting on the curbing. In some ways the world gets

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her letter above, Mrs. Whitfield does not so 
		much complain about the way Maxwell depicts her mother, Hattie Dyer 
		Brummell, as Rachel, Fred Brummell's wife. Maxwell 
		denies that connection: &quot;Austin King's house [a setting in <i>Time Will 
		Darken It</i>, the novel presenting the Fred Brummell character] was 
		clearly our house, to anyone who had ever been in it. In 1912 Hattie was 
		across the street at my Grandmother Blinn's. But during the visit of my 
		Great-Aunt Ina and her family Hattie was working in our kitchen. 
		However, I never had it in mind to write about her. <b>Rachel, the colored 
		woman who worked in the Kings' kitchen, was imaginary</b> (&quot;The Front and 
		the Back Parts of the House,&quot; pp. 104-105).
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; "> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maxwell's denial that he was writing about 
		Hattie in <i>Time Will Darken It</i> would appear to be contradicted by 
		&quot;the rest of the story&quot; of &quot;The Front and the Back Parts of the House.&quot; 
		&quot;<b>If Hattie did indeed read my book then what could she think but that 
		I had portrayed her as a loose woman and her husband as a monster of 
		evil? . . . Any regret for what I may have made Hattie feel is nowhere 
		near enough to have appeased her anger. She was perfectly right not to 
		look at me, not to respond at all, when I put my arms around her&quot;</b> 
		(&quot;House, p. 107).<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; "> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I received Mrs. Whitfield's letter, 
		I wondered whether she was related to Foster Whitfield, my black friend 
		from Lincoln during my last year of high school and freshman year 
		at Lincoln College (1960-61). Priscilla Florence said that Foster was 
		Helen Brummell Whitfield's only child. He had attended Central School with 
		others my age while I attended Jefferson School, so he and I did not meet 
		till high school years. 
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; "> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In later grade school years, Foster had moved from Lincoln for several 
		years till he moved back to Lincoln to finish high school, when he lived with 
		his Grandmother Hattie. During my freshman year at Lincoln College, Foster invited me to 
		see where he lived. I recall he had several candles 
		in his bedroom, and his bedroom 
		window gave him the freedom to come and go at night as he pleased. 
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; "> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately I did not meet his 
		Grandmother Hattie. Of course, even if I had met her, I would have 
		known nothing about her family's significance in the town's history or probably 
		would not have cared even if I had. I am reminded of Maxwell's 
		observation: &quot;<b>You don't know at one time in your life what you will want 
		to know at another</b>.&quot; 
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; "> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below is

		Thanks for recognizing its significance.&nbsp; I regret that I didn't place 
		more value on it when first seeing it.&nbsp; I don't think Uncle Will wrote

		incident is burned in his memory.&nbsp;My mother talks often of her family 
		and others needing to see a dentist, but all dentists but one refused to 
		see black people.&nbsp;The one would see them only after hours, at dark, and 
		required that none of them use the front entrance.&nbsp;They almost never saw 
		a doctor and my family was fortunate in that Uncle Will would do short 
		examinations and make recommendations when he came to visit, which he 
		did as often as possible. </b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, you and Maxwell covered many of

		hurt families a lot, but was no different than other towns in the

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"><b>

		Maxwell mentioned that perhaps Uncle Will's siblings resented him for 
		what was done for him by his donor </b>[benefactor]<b>.&nbsp; No one is 
		around to verify a resentment per se, but there were some sacrifices on 
		everyone's part in the family to help Uncle Will through college and 
		Medical School.&nbsp;The donor paid for a very small part, but the seed was planted.&nbsp;I am 
		learning that Uncle Clarence, his brother,&nbsp;wanted also to go to school, 
		but the family had no extra resources to help him.&nbsp;All extra resources 
		were directed to Uncle Will.</b><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother was also encouraged by Uncle Will to come to Kansas City,

		year or two of junior college.&nbsp;She met my father after he left the 
		army; they married and I was born in the first year of the boomers.&nbsp;My 
		friends think it is amazing that Uncle Will bothered to reach back to 
		women in an age when it was not commonly done.</b><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of him,&nbsp;my mother saw black people

		because when she no longer worked for them, the father would visit her

		<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000"><b>Conclusions</b></font><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		My article titled &quot;Social Consciousness in William Maxwell's Writings 
		Based on Lincoln, Illinois&quot; explains that Maxwell's work captures the 
		social structure of his hometown in the early twentieth century, 
		including the part played by black servants of the upper middle class. 
		&quot;Billie Dyer&quot; and &quot;The Front and the Back Parts of the House&quot; show that 
		toward the end of his life 
		Maxwell developed a strong interest in the history of blacks in 
		Lincoln, especially in the members of the Dyer-Brummell families who 
		worked as servants in the homes of his family. 
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Maxwell expresses his particular interest in Lincoln's black history by 
		describing how the published histories of Lincoln and Logan County do or 
		do not treat the subject. In &quot;The Front and the Back Parts of the 
		House,&quot; Maxwell uses a digression to describe the page in the 1953 
		centennial history of Lincoln (<i>The Namesake Town</i>, p. 33) that 
		summarizes some of the Dyer family history as told by Hattie Dyer Brummell 
		based on an interview with her by someone anonymous (perhaps Raymond 
		Dooley). <b>In that interview, Mrs. Dyer reveals that she is part white 
		and &quot;part 
		Indian--her grandmother, who lived in North Carolina, was the child of a 
		Cherokee Indian father and a white mother. This woman came in the 
		covered wagon days first to Sparta, Illinois, and then to Springfield&quot;</b> 
		(p. 33).<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The last several paragraphs of &quot;Billie Dyer&quot; lament the absence of black 
		history in &quot;the most recent&quot; local history there: Maxwell describes 
		this book, but does not 
		give its title: &quot;a large book--nine by twelve--. . . The likeness of 
		Abraham Lincoln is on the cover, embossed in gold, as if some where in 
		the Afterlife his tall shade had encountered King Midas&quot; (p. 14). 
		Maxwell is clearly referring to the <i>History of Logan County, 
		Illinois, 1982</i>, 
		edited by Paul J. Beaver--I own a copy and easily recognized it from 
		Maxwell's description.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maxwell's criticism 
		of this work is explicit: &quot;Someone who had 
		never lived there [Lincoln] might conclude from this book that the town 
		had no Negroes now or ever. Except for the group pictures of the Lincoln 
		College athletic teams, in which here and there a dark face appears 
		among the lighter ones, there are no photographs of black men and women. 
		And though there are many pictures of white churches of one denomination 
		or another, there is no picture of the African Methodist Episcopal 
		Church [the 1953 centennial history has such a photo]--only a column of 
		text, in which the buildings it occupied and the ministers who served it 
		are listed&quot; (&quot;Billie Dyer,&quot; p. 34). I note that the basketball teams of Lincoln 
		Community High School in the 1982 history also show blacks (Beaver, p. 
		36), and these photos are a better indication of the presence of black families in Lincoln 
		than the pictures of Lincoln College athletes because many students of Lincoln 
		College come from other places, especially the Chicago area.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Maxwell conducted research to discover information about the Dyer-Brummell 
		families so that he could write about them in his final collection of 
		stories. Those stories have prompted my own research on this subject, 
		which has benefited from the Internet. That resource was not available 
		in Mr. Maxwell's lifetime. The results of my research shed light on 
		Maxwell's research and his use of it.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<b>Obviously, William Maxwell's research helped him to write about the Dyer-Brummell 
		families in two of his last stories; but his writing, specifically &quot;The Front 
		and the Back Parts of the House,&quot; does not fully reveal the nature of 
		his research or the way he used it.</b>&nbsp;For example, Maxwell does 
		not identify &quot;the elderly black man&quot; who worked for Tom Perry. In his 
		story, Maxwell could have concisely reported his effort to learn more 
		about the Dyer-Brummells through correspondence with John A. Ross. Such 
		a brief clarification would have been of interest to readers. 
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Additionally, Maxwell surely realized that Ross's life-long experience 
		in Lincoln held much potential as material for literary composition. In his 
		letter to Mr. Ross of January 7, 1987, Maxwell cites information that 
		Mr. Ross had shared that shows Maxwell had an appreciation of Mr. Ross's 
		life that would have been quite suitable for at least one good story:<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
		<b>Dear John,</b><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your letter gave me a great deal of 
		pleasure. I think in many ways your life has been unusual. I certainly 
		don't know anybody who has lived for 80 years, off and on, in the house 
		he was born in. I was born in a house on Ninth Street, but only lived 
		there 12 years. I had two brothers--one of them is now dead </b>[Edward]<b>--but 
		no sisters, and think it must have been a great advantage to be brought 
		up in a house where there were so many children. The first job my father 
		ever had was working as a bill poster for the Opera House </b>[on 
		Broadway Street and later named The Grand Theater]<b>, I think 
		before ever you were born. I marvelled </b>[<i>sic</i>]<b> at your 
		account of your ancestry, and particularly at your great grandfather, 
		who actually managed, as so many men have wanted to, to have 2 wives at 
		the same time. What adventures, what remarkable accidents, what stories 
		the bare facts suggest. Sometime when you're in the mood I hope you will 
		tell me more, since there is, you say, a lot more to tell. . . . Like 
		you, they </b>[the Dyers]<b> were part Indian, part white and part 
		Negro. . . .&quot; </b>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maxwell may or may not have been trying to 
		learn more about Mr. Ross as potential material for a story. We can only 
		speculate on the reason Maxwell does not identify &quot;the elderly black 
		man&quot; or reveal the correspondence with him. The point is that Maxwell 
		has withheld information about his research activity and details about a 
		character that would have interested many of his readers.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		It is puzzling that Maxwell's &quot;The Front and the Back Parts of the 
		House&quot; does not include the paragraph of his letter to John A. Ross of 
		October 24, 1987, in which Maxwell imagines what he does not know about 
		Hattie Dyer Brummell's life because that is a key technique that Maxwell 
		likes to use to create the effect he sought: &quot;the illusion of reality&quot; 
		mentioned below. <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The selections in <i>Billie Dyer and Other Stories</i> about the Dyer-Brummell 
		families depend heavily upon factual information, and readers would like 
		to think that good writing is both 
		complete and free of irrelevancy. My research of the Dyer-Brummells 
		and my analysis of Maxwell's stories about them reveal details that he 
		withheld. In my view, these are not irrelevant: they hold much potential 
		interest for readers, and Maxwell could have easily included them 
		without excessively lengthening the stories. The informal, 
		digressive style he uses in these stories would have easily accommodated 
		such details. But, of course, we must remember that Maxwell is not 
		writing strictly factual prose: he is writing autobiographical fiction. 
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		This kind of writing presents challenging puzzles. One of them 
		is trying to determine whether withheld information is a function of 
		artistic purpose or evidence of flawed writing. Another puzzle--and perhaps an 
		equally unsolvable 
		one--is to distinguish fact from fiction in a given work.
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The author-narrator persona of &quot;The Front and the Back Parts of the 
		House&quot; is a focus of these puzzles. To what extent does this figure 
		reflect autobiographical facts, and to what extent is he a product of 
		the author's imagination? 
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The author-narrator persona of this story does not clarify exactly when he became 
		troubled enough over Hattie's snub to try to discover its cause. After 
		the scene of the snub, he merely says, &quot;Years passed 
		without my thinking about Hattie Dyer at all, and then suddenly there I 
		was backing away from her in confusion. When I told my wife about it she 
		said, 'It wasn't Hattie you embraced but the idea of her.' Which was 
		clearly true, but didn't explain Hattie's behavior&quot; (p. 92). After 
		several pages of digression, the author-narrator says, &quot;I could have asked my aunt 
		[Annette Bates] about Hattie and she would have told me all that a white 
		person would be likely to know, but I didn't. More years passed. I found 
		that I had a nagging curiosity about Hattie--about what her life had 
		been like. Finally it occurred to me that my Cousin Tom Perry, who lives 
		in Lincoln, might be able to learn about her. He wrote back that I had 
		waited too long. Among the white people there was nobody left who knew 
		her, and he couldn't get much information from the black people he 
		talked to&quot; (p. 99).<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		It is curious that when the narrator persona thought about Hattie many 
		years after the snub, he does not say his nagging curiosity was about 
		the reason for her snub. Rather, the curiosity was about &quot;what her life 
		had been like.&quot; Had William Maxwell early on surmised the reason for the 
		snub? The author-narrator says he did not realize the reason for 
		Hattie's snub until several decades after it happened. How likely is it 
		that Maxwell would need that much time--and a special experience to 
		realize that some black people are literate--to surmise the reason for 
		Hattie's snub? 
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		If Maxwell had not figured out the reason for the snub, why did many 
		years pass before he thought about it enough to try to get an answer? 
		Just how troubled about the incident was he if he did not think about it 
		for many years? The snubbing incident happened in the early 1950s, and 
		Hattie died in 1963 (see photo of her headstone below), so there was a 
		period of about ten years in which Maxwell conceivably could have 
		written to Hattie or written to others in Lincoln in an effort to reach her or learn about her. 
		Maxwell could have written his father, who sometimes visited Hattie, 
		until his death in 1958. I also wonder what the year was in which Maxwell was curious 
		enough to write Tom Perry. Was this not until the 
		1980s when Maxwell was working on the stories of <i>Billie Dyer and 
		Other Stories</i>? Maxwell's letter to John A. Ross of January 7, 1987, 
		quoted above, shows that Maxwell was not motivated to write letters of 
		inquiry by nagging 
		curiosity alone, but by a desire to write about the snubbing experience 
		and Hattie.
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Additional insight into the puzzle of fact vs. fiction in the 
		author-narrator can, perhaps, be gained by looking at the 
		literary principles that guided Maxwell's art. 
		Maxwell presents his main beliefs about a 
		writer's purpose and method in a speech delivered at Smith College on March 4, 1955; and 
		in that speech he says that a writer's purpose is to create the illusion 
		of reality (&quot;The Writer as Illusionist&quot;<i> in A William Maxwell Portrait</i>, 
		pp. 208--228). Moreover, the illusion results from fooling the reader: 
		&quot;Writers--narrative writers--are people who perform tricks&quot; (&quot;The Writer 
		as Illusionist,&quot; p. 209). &quot;So far as I can see, there is no legitimate 
		sleight of hand involved in practicing the arts of painting, sculpture, 
		and music. . . . They are fundamentally serious. In writing--in all 
		writing but especially in narrative writing--you are continually being 
		taken in&quot; (p. 211).<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		In his discussion of literary theory, Maxwell describes &quot;tricks of 
		construction&quot; that involve &quot;the whole work&quot; (p. 213). In &quot;The 
		Front and the Back Parts of the House,&quot; Maxwell's potentially greatest 
		&quot;trick&quot; involving the whole work relates to the author-narrator--truly 
		the story's main character, not Hattie--, and the problem is to know to 
		what extent this figure captures Maxwell's actual thoughts and feelings 
		and to what extent this figure's thoughts and feelings are the product 
		of Maxwell using his imagination to create the illusion of reality: to 
		trick the reader.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Maxwell's literary theory suggests that he had been influenced by <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>, 
		a book whose story and theme charmed Maxwell so much that he loaned his 
		copy to his black friend and grade school classmate, John A. Ross. Maxwell's writings based on 
		Lincoln, Illinois, resonate deeply with my personal experience in and 
		curiosity about our mutual hometown, but this old English teacher is 
		intrigued by--and a bit troubled by--the notion that literary art is 
		really literary artifice. I understand the confusion Dorothy must 
		feel when her dog, Toto, accidentally knocks down a screen that reveals 
		the true identity of the wizard:<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<b>The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he 
		gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto 
		jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a 
		corner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next 
		moment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in 
		just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head 
		and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were. 
		The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and cried 
		out, &quot;Who are you?&quot; </b></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		&quot;I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,&quot; said the little man, in a trembling 
		voice. &quot;But don't strike me--please don't--and I'll do anything you want 
		me to</b>&quot; (Chapter 15: &quot;The Discovery of Oz--The Terrible,&quot; T<i>he 
		Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>).</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Later, Dorothy and her needy friends are reassured by the wizard's wise 
		advice.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		In &quot;The Writer as Illusionist,&quot; Maxwell says that &quot;the writer must be 
		taken in by his own tricks&quot; (p. 211). This concept is significant 
		for the question of fact vs. fiction in the author-narrator of &quot;The 
		Front and the Back Parts of the House.&quot; The author-narrator says he did 
		not realize the reason for Hattie's snub until several decades after it 
		happened. If that is true--and not literary fiction--, the delayed epiphany suggests that Maxwell had been taken 
		in by one of his own tricks.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Maxwell's self-delusion is that no one would discover the connection 
		between George Brummell, Hattie's husband, and the fictionalized, 
		unsympathetic portrayal of him as Fred in <i>Time Will Darken It.</i>&nbsp; 
		If this connection were discovered, moreover, Maxwell believed that he stood to profit: &quot;I had 
		exposed their married life and blackened his character [Hattie's 
		husband] in order to make a fortune from my writing. I was a thousand 
		miles away, where she [Hattie] couldn't confront me with what I had 
		done. And if she accused me to other people it would only call attention 
		to the book and make more people read it than had already&quot; (&quot;Front and 
		Back Parts of the House,&quot; p. 107). </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Maxwell's self-deception could derive from the white stereotype that black servants were illiterate, or 
		otherwise ignorant of or uninterested in literature. Maxwell had left 
		Lincoln, but certain upper-middle-class racial attitudes had not left 
		him. Maxwell had deceived (&quot;tricked&quot;) himself until his cousin in Lincoln revealed 
		that his black lawn keeper was reading one of Maxwell's books. In that 
		moment, Maxwell realizes that Hattie knew he had exploited her family: 
		&quot;And in a flash I realized what the unforgivable thing was [offense to 
		Hattie] and who had done it&quot; (&quot;Front and Back Parts,&quot; p. 102). 
		Maxwell had been forced to peek behind his own screen. </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I, too, peeked behind it by investigating Maxwell's research into the 
		Dyer-Brummell family. I discovered that Maxwell's research was more 
		extensive than he reveals in his writing, but that he did not gain as 
		much information as he had wanted to.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Maxwell's literary depiction of blacks, combined with information from 
		other historical sources, reveals much about 
		their identify and their role in the social history of the Great Emancipator's first 
		namesake town. There is considerable irony that two of the best-known black 
		families in the history of Lincoln, Illinois--those of John A. Ross and 
		of Alfred and Laura Ward Dyer--were racially mixed and that the namesake 
		of this town, Abraham Lincoln, like many Americans then and thereafter, 
		was opposed to what Lincoln's contemporaries called &quot;amalgamation.&quot; As 
		noted above in this essay, both the Ross and Dyer-Brummell families had 
		white, black, and Indian ancestors. In his opening speech in the fifth 
		Lincoln-Douglas Debate at Charleston, Lincoln expressed views that his 
		critics have often cited: &quot;I am not nor ever 
		have been in favor of making voters of the negroes, or jurors, or 
		qualifying them to hold office, or having them to marry with white 
		people. . . . I do not understand that because I do not want a negro 
		woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife. . . . It seems 
		to me that it is quite possible for us to get along without making 
		either slaves or wives of negroes&quot; (Holzer, <i>The Lincoln-Douglas 
		Debates</i>, p. 188). </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Abraham Lincoln, in addition to many of his contemporaries, had favored returning blacks to 
		Africa (&quot;colonization&quot;), and he apparently did not realize that free 
		blacks would consider the United States to be their country of choice 
		and would want to remain here. Lincoln was also unable to foresee the 
		social and political consequences of freedom for blacks living 
		in a country that promised its people &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
		happiness.&quot; </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Social and political equality between races was not an aspect of the lives of blacks in 
		Lincoln, Illinois, that Maxwell's stories are much concerned with. As I explain in &quot;Social 
		Consciousness in William Maxwell's Writings Based on Lincoln, Illinois,&quot; 
		he only briefly describes subtle racial prejudice and does not explore 
		racial discrimination. Maxwell's focus on family life was a logical 
		limitation of writing based mainly on childhood memory.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My 
		most rewarding experience in peeking behind Maxwell's screen is my 
		belief that he would have shared my 
		pleasure in learning of the many present-day successes and enduring ties 
		in the black families he wrote about: the living 
		legacy of John A. Ross, Dr. William Dyer, and Hattie Dyer Brummell. </p><hr color="#008000" width="90%" size="1"></td>

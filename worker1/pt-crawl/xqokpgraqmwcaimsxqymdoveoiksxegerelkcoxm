<B>HISTORY</B>
<p>
 European contacts with Sierra Leone were among the first 
in West Africa, and Sierra Leone was one of the first 
West African British colonies.  
Foreign settlement did not occur until 1787, when the 
British prepared a refuge within the British empire for 
freed slaves; that year, the site of Freetown received 
400 freedmen from Great Britain.  Disease and hostility 
from the indigenous people nearly eliminated the first group of returnees.    
Thousands of slaves were returned to or liberated in 
Freetown.  Most chose to remain in Sierra Leone.  These 
returned Africans--or Creoles as they came to be called--
were from all areas of Africa.  Cut off from their homes 
and traditions by the experience of slavery, they 
assimilated British styles of life and built a 
flourishing trade on the West African coast.  
<p>
In the early 19th century, Freetown served as the 
residence of the British governor who also ruled the Gold 
Coast (now Ghana) and the Gambia settlements.  Sierra 
Leone served as the educational center of British West 
Africa as well.  Fourah Bay College, established in 1827, 
rapidly became a magnet for English-speaking Africans on 
the West Coast.  For more than a century, it was the only 
European-style university in Western Sub-Saharan Africa.  
The colonial history of Sierra Leone was not placid.  The 
indigenous people mounted several unsuccessful revolts 
against British rule and Creole domination.  Most of the 
20th century history of the colony was peaceful, however, 
and independence was achieved without violence.  The 1951 
constitution provided a framework for decolonization.  
<p>
Local ministerial responsibility was introduced in 1953, 
when Sir Milton Margai was appointed Chief Minister.  He 
became Prime Minister after successful completion of 
constitutional talks in London in 1960.  Independence 
came in April 1961, and Sierra Leone opted for a 
parliamentary system within the British Commonwealth.
Sir Milton's Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP) led the 
country to independence and the first general election 
under universal adult franchise in May 1962.  Upon Sir 
Milton's death in 1964, his half-brother, Sir Albert 
Margai, succeeded him as Prime Minister.  Sir Albert 
attempted to establish a one-party political system but 
met fierce resistance from the opposition All Peoples 
Congress (APC).  He ultimately abandoned the idea.  
In closely contested elections in March 1967, the APC won 
a plurality of the parliamentary seats.  Accordingly, the 
governor general (representing the British Monarch) 
declared Siaka Stevens--APC leader and Mayor of Freetown-
-as the new Prime Minister.  Within a few hours, Stevens 
and Margai were placed under house arrest by Brigadier 
David Lansana, the Commander of the Republic of Sierra 
Leone Military Forces (RSLMF), on grounds that the 
determination of office should await the election of the 
tribal representatives to the house.  A group of senior 
military officers overrode this action by seizing control 
of the government on March 23, arresting Brigadier 
Lansana, and suspending the constitution.  The group 
constituted itself as the National Reformation Council 
(NRC) with Brigadier A.T. Juxon-Smith as its chairman.  
The NRC in turn was overthrown in April 1968 by a 
"sergeants' revolt," the Anti-Corruption Revolutionary 
Movement.  NRC members were imprisoned, and other army 
and police officers deposed.  Stevens at last assumed the 
office of Prime Minister under the restored constitution. 
The return to civilian rule led to bi-elections beginning 
in the fall of 1978 and the appointment of an all-APC 
cabinet.  Tranquillity was not completely restored.  In 
1970, a state of emergency was declared after provincial 
disturbances, and in March 1971 and July 1974, alleged 
military coup plots were uncovered by the government.  
The leaders of the plots were tried and executed.  In 
1977, student demonstrations against the government 
disrupted Sierra Leone politics. 
<p>
Following the adoption of the republican constitution in 
April 1971, Siaka Stevens was appointed President of the 
Republic by the House; he was inaugurated for a second 
five-year term in April 1977.  In the national election 
that followed in May 1977, the APC won 74 seats and the 
opposition SLPP 15.  The next year, Stevens' Government 
won approval for the idea of one-party government, which 
the APC had once rejected.  Following enactment of the 
1978 constitution, SLPP members of parliament joined the APC.  
The first election under the new one-party constitution 
took place on May 1, 1982.  Elections in about two-thirds 
of the constituencies were contested.  Because of 
irregularities, elections in 13 constituencies were 
canceled by the government.  Bi-elections took place on 
June 4, 1982.  The new cabinet appointed after the 
election was balanced ethnically between Temnes and 
Mendes.  It included as the new Finance Minister Salia 
Jusu-Sheriff, a former leader of the SLPP who returned to 
that party in late 1981.  His accession to the cabinet 
was viewed by many as a step toward making the APC a true national party. 
Siaka P. Stevens, who had been head of state of Sierra 
Leone for 18 years, retired from that position in 
November 1985, although he continued his role as chairman 
of the ruling APC party.  In August 1985, the APC named 
military commander Joseph Saidu Momoh as party candidate 
to succeed Stevens; he was Stevens' own choice.  Momoh 
was elected President in a one-party referendum on 
October 1, 1985.  A formal inauguration was held in 
January 1986; new parliamentary elections were held in May 1986.  
In October 1990, President Momoh set up a constitutional 
review commission to review the one-party 1978 
constitution with a view to broadening the existing 
political process, guaranteeing fundamental human rights 
and the rule of law, and strengthening and consolidating 
the democratic foundation and structure of the nation.  
<p>
The commission, in its report presented January 1991, 
recommended re-establishment of a multi-party system of 
government.  Based on that recommendation, a constitution 
was approved by parliament in July 1991 and ratified in 
September; it received presidential assent in September 
and became effective on October 1, 1991.  There was great 
suspicion that Momoh was not serious, however, and APC 
rule was increasingly marked by abuses of power.  The 
rebel war in the eastern part of the county posed an 
increasing burden on the country, and on April 29, 1992, 
a group of young RSLMF officers launched a military coup 
which sent Momoh into exile in Guinea and established the 
NPRC as the ruling authority in Sierra Leone.

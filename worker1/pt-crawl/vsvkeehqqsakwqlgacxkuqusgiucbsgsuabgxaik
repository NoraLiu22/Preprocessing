<h2>Pimbley's Dictionary of Heraldry - E</h2>

<p><strong>Eagle</strong> - The eagle plays an important part in
heraldry in almost every part of the globe. Its earliest rise to
popularity, however, was in Germany, where, after it became the
emblem of the empire, it was adopted by some of the princes and many
of the nobles. A double-headed eagle is also the emblem of Russia and
Austria. On the roll of Henry III the eagle appears but twice, but in
the roll of Edward II there are forty-three examples of it. Nobles of
the Holy Roman Empire place their shields on the breast of an eagle,
examples of which may be seen in the arms of the Duke of Marlborough
, the Earl of Denbigh and Lord Arundel of Wardour.</p>

<p>The imperial eagle is invariably represented as two-headed, the
origin of which is obscure. Charlemagne is said to have used it to
signify that in his hands was the government of both the Roman and
the German empires.</p>

<p>The eagle is generally borne displayed; that is, upright, breast
to the front, and legs, tail and wings expanded (commonly called a
&quot;spread eagle&quot;).</p>

<p>The Bald Eagle, adopted as the national emblem of the United
States, is a large and powerful bird, with a far greater spread of
wing than the European white-tailed species.</p>

a different color from that of the body. In such a case the animal is

marquis.</p>

<p>EARL'S CORONET - The head attire of an earl, sometimes used in

rising out of an earl's coronet. This is unusual, however. Generally
a ducal coronet is used.</p>

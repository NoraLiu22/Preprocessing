<h2> <a name="about">About the flag</a></h2>
<p>This rune-like white-on-black flag apparently 
is described as the &quot;white eagle of Wales&quot;.&nbsp; It is also referred to as Eryr 
Gwyn. I have never seen this symbol in use, not even alongside the Nationalist 
slogans that grace walls in Wales. Maybe it had something to do with the Free 
Wales Army? It appears on the image at
<a href="http://cy_usa.tripod.com/WARRIORCOS.jpg">this site</a> as well as on the uniform of the 'soldier'.<i><br>
Dafydd Young</i>, 29 July 2002

</p>

<p>The white runic symbol on the black background, is indeed a representation of 
the Snowdonian Eagle, and was I believe worn on the uniforms of volunteers in 
the Free Wales Army.<br>
<i>Philip R. Williams</i>, 19 September 2002</p>

<p>The White Eagle of Snowdonia flag was used by units of the Free Wales Army in 
the 1960's in Wales, as well as other republican groups into the 1990's. <br>
Throughout the '60's and '70's it was widespread across Wales in the form of 
slogans painted on walls etc, and can still be seen in places. <br>
<i>Leighton Smart</i>, 6 February 2003</p>

<p>The white eagle flag was indeed used by the Free Wales Army (in Welsh <i>
Byddin Rhyddid Cymru</i>) however its background was red not black (when the 
background was used). The symbol is a heraldic symbol for an eagle and 
represents the eagles of Snowdonia which legend says will defend Wales.<br clear="left">
<i>Muiris Mag Ualghairg</i>, 18 April 2003</p>

<p>The white eagle flag is still paraded around by groups like MRC and others 
hanging on the coattails of the defunct Free Wales Army who also scrawl the 
badge on walls occasionally, sometimes in its older and more elaborate form 
which has &quot;feet&quot; and a &quot;tail&quot; and looks like the x commonly used in maths struck 
through by an archaic s - the one like a long f . One site that I browsed 
earlier has pictures of one of these neo-fascist rallies displaying all the 
flags that they can think of, the colour party are dressed in red shirts with 
black berries with the white eagle symbol on a circular red badge. to search for 
such material, try entering &quot;Cilmeri&quot; into a search<br>
engine, they have annual rallies there.<br>
<i>David Barry Lawrence</i>, 7 March 2004</p>
<p>The 'White Eagle Cross' originated in the 1960's.&nbsp; It is thought to have 
been based on heraldic shorthand; many think this was the work of Republican &amp; 
Romantic Poet Patriot the late Harri Web. The White Eagle Cross was given much 
publicity by the F.W.A. but in fact it was a &quot;Welsh Symbol of Resistance&quot; used 
by many Patriots then and since.<br>

<p>The late Anthony Lewis, renowned Celtic jeweller and the most celebrated 
heraldic artist and vexillologist of his generation, drew this definitive design 
for the White Eagle of Snowdon ('Eryr Wen Eryri' or 'Eagle Cross') in 1999 
having made a great number of cap badges, armbands, flags and banners showing 
the device over the years since his role as a militant republican in the late 
1960s. In 1969 Mr Lewis was arrested and imprisoned for his involvement with the 
FWA (Free Wales Army) and the NPF (National Patriotic Front) in the run up to 
the Investiture of Prince Charles in 1969. I met Mr Lewis here in the 1990s 
where he had a studio and shop through our mutual interest in flying model 
aircraft, and he kindly sent me the immaculately crafted design for the White 
Eagle, which I attach for your interest. The Eagle Cross has become synonymous 
with uncompromising Welsh republicanism and is still seen all over Wales � a 
symbol of resistance and freedom. Mr Lewis was the artist who first drew the now 
universally accepted � and much copied, often incorrectly! � banner of the great 
Welsh Prince Owain <a href="gb-wa-og.html">Glynd&#373;r's</a> (quarterly gules 
or four lions rampant counterchanged). He died last year, but his legacy will be 
long lasting.<br>
<i>Niall Caveen</i>, 19 June 2006</p>
<p>I found in a book of heraldry reference to the symbol's origins on the free 
Wales army flag. The white tailed / sea eagle was predominant in Snowdonia / 
Eruri and believed to endow those who ate its flesh with the gift of prophecy. 
There is a famous poem about the 'son of prophecy' who will throw the English 
out of Wales, and presumably he would be bearing the eagle on his shield. 
Various would-be national saviours like Glyndwr were hailed as the long awaited 
'son of prophecy'. Glyndwr was reputed to be interested in using magic and may 
have deliberately eaten the eagle's flesh to fulfill the myth. The symbol was 
apparently devised in direct reference to these mythical ideas in the 1960's.</p>
<p>The poem was addressed to Llewelyn ab Iorweth ( died 1240 ) by the bard 
Prydydd y Moch. Part of it is :<br>
<br>
Darogan Mertin dyuod breyenhin<br>
O Gymry werin o gamhwri.<br>
Dywawd derwyton dadeni haelon<br>
O hil eryron o Eryri.<br>
<br>
Myrddin's prophecy is that a king shall come<br>
With heroism from among the welsh people.<br>
Prophets have said that generous men shall be reborn<br>
Of the lineage of the eagles of Snowdonia.</p>

<p>There are several variations on the theme for the design of the white eagle 
flag. I finally found some pictures on the internet to refer to:

<p><a href="../images/g/gb_w-machynlle.jpg">This picture</a> is from the book 
'To Dream of Freedom' by Roy Clews. It shows the &quot;eagle&quot; flag in its early 
version, with &quot;feet&quot; and a &quot;head&quot;. The picture must date from 1960-65. It is a 
black and white photo, but I suspect that lurking in the background greys is a 
green, red, white tricolour as presently used by Cymru Rhydd<br>
(Free Wales ) with a black star added. This is a North Wales outfit that I have 
never met.<br>
<i>David B. Lawrence</i>, 27 July 2005</p>


<p>I read recently that the eagle glyph was devised by Harri Webb, poet and 
editor of &quot;The Welsh Republican&quot; bi-monthy published circa 1950-1955, 
and as such presumably predates the Free Wales Army flag.<br>

<h2><a name="white">Black Eagles turning into White Eagles?</a></h2>
I'm returning to look at what has been written about the White Eagle flag again 
because I've just added another piece of information to an idea about the kind 
of material that Harri Webb might have been drawing on if he is the author of 
it. At least three sorts of putatively historical origins now exist for this 
flag - that it is a reference to Wales' 'Roman' origins in the province of 
Britannia Prima and thus invokes the imperial eagle declared to be the symbol of 
SPQR (= the Senate and People of Rome); that it is a reference to medieval or 
Celtic mysticism such as to the Mab Darogan as in the poem quoted above, who 
might have eaten the flesh of the sea-eagle to acquire prophetic power maybe 
over the four elements (by consuming an animal that could venture upon water, 
earth and air now transformed by fire); that it is a romantic invention by Harri 
Webb referring to revolutionary republicanism, imagining the Welsh as standard 
bearers perhaps in a universalising republic carrying of one of Napoleon's 
eagles. But the Roman and the Napoleonic eagle standards were both gilded and 
whilst the mystical eagle may have been white for some reason, why equally not 
choose some other colour or its own natural colours? An early version of the 
flag, of which I do not have a picture to post, is naturalistic so why should 
Harri Webb choose to put a white eagle on a black flag?<br><br>I've just been 
reading about the origins of Barclay's Bank's eagle and by chance it ties up 
with this, speculatively... in the past I read about William Erbury a radical 
preacher from Cardiff and he like many other of those 17c radicals converged on 
the printing and publishing operation conducted by Giles and Elizabeth Calvert 
from May 1644 onwards in London 'at a tenement at the sign of the 
Black-Spread-Eagle at the west end of St Paul's Cathedral in the parish of St 
Gregory by Paul's ... it was situated on the busy street leading from Ludgate 
Hill to the cathedral ... the modern day 54 Lombard Street.'(Oxford Dictionary 
of National Biography) The eagle has a long mythical association of the idea of 
bringing down messages from heaven to earth and is a fitting symbol for the 
activities conducted there. Calvert published Levellers', Diggers', Ranters', 
Quakers' and many other radical religious and political leaflets - in short he 
was prepared to publish anything and suffered for it once governmental authority 
re-established itself. All of these publications would have stated their origins 
at the Black Spread Eagle so the association would have been made at that time 
with radicalism. His wife continued the work with a secret portable printing 
press after his death, but presumably it eventually failed and the premises 
passed through several hands until it became the headquarters of what was to 
become Barclays Bank. The sign was still hanging outside in 1728 when the bank 
moved in and is the origins of the present day Barclays Bank logo - which has 
recently appeared as a blue eagle and is now a white eagle on blue backgrounds. 
The occasion of finding out this connection has been my<br>investigating the 
false fuss made in the press in recent years over Barclay's eagle being 
supposedly 'Nazi' and offending the new Dutch proprietors. Barclays Bank has in 
fact a long history of liberal left-leaning attitudes, being the result of a 
radical merger engineered by Quaker banks after a spectacular run of one of 
their number that wasn't surpassed until Northern Rock recently. So why not 
consider that the black eagle's history may imply that left-leaning literary man 
Harri Webb knew all about it having radical associations?<br><br>So since 
Barclay's eagle can turn from black to white why not Harri Webb's if he culled 
it from this historical radical source ?<br><br>Here is a picture of an old 
fashioned Barclays Bank sign -

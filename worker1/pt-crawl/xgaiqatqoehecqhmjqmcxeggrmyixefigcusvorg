          By George Holbert Tucker<br>
          Chapter 46</h5>
        <h3 align="left">Lincoln Plans the Recapture of Norfolk</h3>
        <p>Abraham Lincoln never set foot in Norfolk, but he visited the area 
          briefly in 1862 and helped plan the campaign that resulted in taking 
          the city from the Confederate forces.</p>
        <p>McClellan's army was in the first stages of the Peninsula campaign, 
          and the CSS Virginia (the former USS Merrimack) and the Monitor had 
          just locked horns on March 9, 1862, in Hampton Roads. At that point, 
          Lincoln decided to visit Fort Monroe, &quot;to ascertain by personal 
          observation whether some further vigilance and vigor might not be infused 
          into the operation of the Army and Navy.&quot;</p>
        <p>As the presidential party, consisting of Lincoln, Secretary of State 
          Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, and Brigadier General 
          Egbert Ludovickus Viele left Washington on May 5, 1862, news arrived 
          that the Confederate forces had withdrawn from Yorktown. The trip down 
          the bay on the Coast Guard cutter Miami was rough and it was not until 
          around nine o'clock the next night that Fort Monroe was reached.</p>
        <p>After an early breakfast, the presidential party visited the Monitor 
          and then went over to the Rip Raps. Just then the Virginia steamed into 
          sight off Sewells Point, and as it was surmised that she might again 
          engage the Monitor, the party took time off to see a fight that never 
          took place.</p>
        <p>That night it was decided that Norfolk must be captured in order to 
          deprive the Virginia of her supply base. And the next morning a bombardment 
          of the Sewells Point batteries was begun. But the sudden appearance 
          of the Virginia put an end to the attack. It was then realized that 
          a successful landing could only be made on the south side of Hampton 
          Roads in a spot out of range of the Virginia's guns. And on May 9, 1862, 
          Secretary Chase, Gen. John E. Wool, and others conducted a reconnaissance 
          operation off Ocean View.</p>
        <p>Returning to Fort Monroe, they found Lincoln in consultation with a 
          pilot familiar with Norfolk area waters. The party then set out again, 
          this time including Lincoln, who refused to permit an attack on Confederates 
          that could easily be seen on the beach. That night, six thousand troops 
          were ferried across to Ocean View on the Old Bay Line steamer Adelaide. 
          No resistance was made. In the meantime, panic reigned in Norfolk where 
          the Confederate forces, under <a href="/web/20071022033431/http://norfolkhistorical.org/insights/2002_spring/huger">General 
          Benjamin Huger</a>, were preparing to evacuate the city and burn the 
          Gosport Navy Yard.</p>
        <p>Lincoln, Chase, Stanton, and General Wool came over to Ocean View early 
          the next morning but found that the troops had already begun their march 
          toward Norfolk. Chase and Wool followed them, but Lincoln and Stanton 
          returned to Fort Monroe to await the results. Little resistance was 
          encountered by the troops, but upon reaching Indian Pole Bridge (now 
          the site of the Granby Street Bridge), they found that it had been fired 
          by the retreating Confederates and a detour had to be made.</p>
        <p>Mayor William Wilson Lamb and other members of the Norfolk Council 
          were awaiting them on Princess Anne Road with a flag of truce, and General 
          Wool accepted the surrender of the city and rode back into Norfolk with 
          Mayor Lamb and Secretary Chase in the mayor's carriage.</p>
        <p>After Mayor Lamb had explained the surrender to a crowd at the Court 
          House, three cheers were given for Jefferson Davis and three groans 
          for Lincoln. Later that evening, when General Wool and Secretary Chase 
          returned to Fort Monroe, they went straight to Lincoln's room.</p>
        <p>&quot;Norfolk is ours!&quot; Wool announced. Stanton was so delighted 
          with the news that he hugged the general. The next morning as the presidential 
          party was about to embark on the USS Baltimore to return to Washington, 
          Commodore Louis M. Goldsborough announced that the Virginia had been 
          blown up by her men off Craney Island. Lincoln then visited Norfolk's 
          inner harbor to see the still-burning Navy Yard. Anchoring off Norfolk, 
          he and his party discovered that the Monitor and other United States 
          vessels had preceded them.</p>
        <p>After a brief stop at Fort Monroe, the Baltimore proceeded back to 
          Washington. In the words of Secretary Chase, &quot;So ended a brilliant 
          week's campaign by the President.&quot;</p>

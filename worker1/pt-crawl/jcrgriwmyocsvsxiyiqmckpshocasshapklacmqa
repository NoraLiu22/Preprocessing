<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">On 02 June 2009, the political party 
which brought Seychelles to independence before transforming it into a modern, 
middle-income country underwent a metamorphosis and changed its name from 
SPUP-SPPF to <i>Parti Lepep</i>. This change of name encapsulates a sea-change 
in the countryï¿½s politics. A new flag was also adopted which has a red field 
with a sun and three sunbeams emanating from the canton.<br>

<p>The Seychelles National Party (SNP), a Liberal party, emerged as the 
clandestine &quot;<i>Parti Seselwa</i>&quot; in 1991; when multipartism was proclaimed the same 
year, the Party Seselwa was the first officially registered party. The next 
year, during which the first multiparty election scheduled in the country since 1974 
took place, the 
Party Seselwa did not reach the 5% share of the votes and thus could not enter 
the Constituent Assembly that drafted the new Constitution. In the 1993 general 
elections, the Party Seselwa, the National Alliance Party and the Seychellois 
National Movement formed &quot;The United Opposition&quot; (UO).&nbsp; The UO won 9% of the 
share of the votes and the historic leader of the Party Seselwa, Wavel 
Ramkalawan, was proportionally-elected to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>In 1998, the UO increased its share of the votes to 27% and became the second 
most represented party after the Seychelles Peoples Progressive Front (SPPF); 
Ramkalawan was appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly. The 
same year, the Party Seselwa was renamed the Seychelles National Party. In 2002, 
the SNP increased its share of the votes to 43%, winning 11 of the 34 seats of 
the National Assembly, which were confirmed in the 2007 election. Wavel 
Ramkalawan could not manage to be elected President of the Republic, either in 
2001 or 2006, with 44% and 46% of the share of the votes, respectively.<br>

<p>The SNP website shows several photographs of meetings and street 
demonstrations involving the party. The most frequently seen flag is a plain 
green flag, with several shade variations. The party seat is located in a place 
called <i>Arpent Vert</i> (literally &quot;Green Arpent&quot;) which might be the origin of the 
party's colour. During the &quot;GST March&quot; (2003), the green flag was used, together 
with a green flag bearing the party acronym in yellow capital letters and 
another green flag with an emblem. <br>

<p>During the &quot;Rally 
against High Cost of Living&quot; (26 May 2008), green flags were still used, 
together with green flags with the party's acronym either in yellow or white 
capital letters. A green flag bears, below the party's acronym in yellow 
capital letters, &quot;<i>Parti Seselwa</i>&quot; in white capital letters. An horizontally 
divided green-white flag bears the party's acronym in green capital letters 
in the white stripe. <br>

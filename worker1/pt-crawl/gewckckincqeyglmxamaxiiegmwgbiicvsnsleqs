<p>Similar to the national flag, red flag with white disk containing the 
crescent and star (apparently somewhat smaller than in the national flag) and 
above the disk in yellow Arabic letters inscribed &quot;<i>Li-l-watan</i>,&quot; meaning 
&quot;For the nation&quot;. There is 
a golden/yellow fringe along the three outer edges. A red ribbon is attached to 
the flag pole above the
flag, fringed golden at the short edge and with a white disk with crescent and 
star near the fringe.<br>
<i>&#381;eljko Heimer</i>, 11 April 2003</p>
<p>The Tunisian defense attach<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> in 
Washington said this flag used to be displayed by all commanders in the armed 
forces, but is now limited to the President. I would surmise that it represents 
his capacity as commander-in-chief of the
armed forces.<br>

http://www.defenselink.mil/photos/Oct2000/001007-D-9880W-053.html</a> is a 
recent photograph of President Ben Ali meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Cohen with two flags along the wall. One is a fringed version of the 
Tunisian national flag with an Arabic inscription in white in the upper hoist. I 
have seen this flag in Tunisian military offices during previous visits; as I 
recall, the inscription reads &quot;<i>li-l watan</i>&quot; (for the nation) [the -tan portion is 
visible in the photograph linked above]. The other is bluish-violet with an Arabic monogram surrounded by 
an olive wreath, all in silver. The monogram appears to consist of two letters, 
one&nbsp; of which is a &quot;<i>jim</i>&quot; (transliterated in English as j). The other may be 
a &quot;<i>ta</i>&quot;, which would suggest a monogram for <i>Al-Jumhuriyah at-Tunisiyah</i>, (the 
Tunisian Republic), but I can't tell for sure. An interesting feature is that 
both flags are topped with short cravats with miniature versions of the devices 
on the flags.
Does anyone have any further information on these?<br>
<i>Joe McMillan</i>, 27 September 2000</p>
<p>I wonder if the purple or dark blue flag in this picture might not be the 
actual presidential flag of Tunisia. If not, I don't know what it is--the 
photograph was taken in President Ben Ali's office, I believe, and is obviously 
part of a matching set with the modified national flag that we've assumed to be 
the flag of the President. <br>
<br>
I've seen the national flag with inscription at the Tunisian ambassador's 
residence in Washington and asked the Tunisian military attach<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> 
what it was--he said it used to be the flag of army units but was now the 
president's flag, which didn't really explain what it was doing in the 
ambassador's residence, of course.<br>
<br>
I wonder if the national flag with the slanted inscription (which reads &quot;<i>lil-watan</i>,&quot; 
i.e. &quot;for the nation/<i>pour la patrie</i>&quot;) might not be some kind of 
ceremonial national flag--possibly the national *color* and the dark purple/blue 
flag the president's personal flag. The only letter of the Arabic monogram that 
I can make out in the picture is a &quot;<i>j</i>&quot;, which could stand for the word <i>
jumhuriya</i>, meaning &quot;republic.&quot; The emblem as replicated on the mini-cravat 
at the top of the flag. It appears to me (maybe Dov can give his reaction) to be 
a &quot;<i>tughra</i>&quot;-style monogram of the letters R and J, which could conceivably 
stand for &quot;<i>ra'is al-jumhuriyah</i>,&quot; i.e., &quot;president of the republic.&quot;<br>
<i>Joe McMillan</i>, 27 May 2004</p>
<p>This dark violet flag must be the presidential flag because it was also used 
by the president on an official trip to Morocco. It was reported by Jose Luis Cepero 
(then living in Morocco) and published in Flag Report about one year ago. A correction adding the wreaths (missed by Cepero in his first report, but noted 
in a second observation on Moroccan TV) and correction of some details in the 
emblem is due to be published next year. Perhaps the other flag is the flag of 
the supreme commander of the armed forces, who is also the president?<br>
<i>Jaume Oll�</i>, 27 May 2004</p>
<p>I did a search on &quot;+president +tunisie +drapeau&quot; and found, <i>inter alia</i>, 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618231920/http://www.carthage.tn/">www.carthage.tn</a>. This site is a record of the President's doings and sayings. At
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618231920/http://www.carthage.tn/html/lepresident/photos/index.html">
www.carthage.tn/html/lepresident/photos/index.html</a> is a set of photos, none 
of which contains the violet/blue flag with the monogram -- surprising if it is 
the official presidential flag. On the other hand, at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618231920/http://www.carthage.tn/html/activites/2004/05/26/a1.html">
www.carthage.tn/html/activites/2004/05/26/a1.html</a> we have a photo of the 
President being presidential, with both the national flag with inscription and 
the blue/violet flag.<br>
<br>
Looking at all these pictures I have noticed something odd: the symbols are 
arranged so that they appear vertical on a flag hanging down on an indoor pole, 
i.e. with the lower fly corner straight down. In other words, the symbols are 
placed *diagonally* on the flag. This applies to both the monogram on the
blue/violet flag and the national emblem and inscription on the national flag.<br>
<br>
This might suggest that &#381;eljko's original gif above was correct, and the
&quot;presidential&quot; flag (as we call it) does have the inscription horizontal and 
that what we are seeing in the photos is a ceremonial version of the flag for 
indoor use with *everything* rotated. However, the
<a href="/web/20080618231920/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/t/tn_pre.jpg">TV capture here</a> of the flag flying outdoors 
clearly does show the national symbol as we would expect it and the inscription 
set diagonally. So there are two versions of this flag.<br>
<i>Andr� Coutanche</i>, 28 May 2004</p>
<p>The background image on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618231920/http://www.carthage.tn/">www.carthage.tn</a> 
site shows that the letters clearly are Arabic R and J, each with an ornamental 
&quot;tail&quot; looping over the top. Is it my monitor, or does the inscription on the 
national flag, &quot;<i>al-watan</i>&quot; look more white than gold?<br>
<i>Joe McMillan</i>, 28 May 2004</p>
<p>It is not just your monitor. And a somewhat clearer image at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618231920/http://www.alkhadra.com/basicdata/index.html">
http://www.alkhadra.com/basicdata/index.html</a> also has the inscription 
looking more white than gold to me.<br>
<i>Ned Smith</i>, 28 May 2004</p>
<p><a href="bib-pay.html#pay00">Album des Pavillons (2000)</a> shows the fringe 
as gold, but 
<a href="bib-smi.html#smi75b">Smith (1975)</a> shows it white. Maybe it varies, 
or has changed?<br>
<i>&#381;eljko Heimer</i>, 24 January 2001</p>
<p>To help resolve the question of this flag's identity, it is mentioned above 
that the inscription on the flag could not be read in its entirety. Two very 
clear images giving a good view of the inscription can be seen at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618231920/http://www.benali.tn/images/logo.gif">
http://www.benali.tn/images/logo.gif</a> and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618231920/http://www.carthage.tn/html/index.html">
http://www.carthage.tn/html/index.html</a>. The first is a logo combining 
elements of the purple flag with the Tunisian flag and the second is from the 
official website of the President of the Republic of Tunisia. Also on that 
website, if one clicks on the Flash presentation and then clicks on the 
President link and selects either Biography or Oeuvre one finds the inscription 
on purple used as the background.<br>
<i>Ned Smith</i>, 27 January 2006</p>
<p>The violet flag that can be seen in the back of the President is the Tunisian 
&quot;presidency flag&quot;; It is not a personal flag. On the flag are represented the 
two Arab letters &quot;ra&quot;and &quot;jim&quot; for &quot;riesset al jumhouriya&quot; for presidency of the 
republic. If it was &quot;president&quot;, it should be &quot;rais&quot;. The red flag is the 
president's flag.<br>

<p>
I show the image here with a large disk as in <a href="bib-pay.html#pay00">Album 
des Pavillons (2000)</a>, though if the fringe is correct, the disk is probably 
not, and should match the &quot;usual&quot; size. This (or better the white fringed 
variant that I'll show subsequently) was adopted earliest on 25 July 1957 when 
Tunisia became a republic and Habib Bourguiba became president. It may be 
possible that it was abandoned on 07 November 1987 when Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 
replaced Bourguiba as president. To speculate further, the yellow fringed flag 
might have been a version used at first (shortly?) before the current &quot;Li-l-watan&quot; 
flag was adopted. This would make the Tunisian Republic one of the several that 
under French influence have habits of using different flags for subsequent 
presidents. It may be too early for any conclusions, as we have only two 
presidents to look at. Certainly, it wouldn't be surprising.<br>

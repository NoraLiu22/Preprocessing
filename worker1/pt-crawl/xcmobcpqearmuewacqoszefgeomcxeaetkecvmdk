		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>On 18 December 1997, Parliament was dissolved pending the March 1998 elections, thus ending the four-year mandate of the legislature which had been chosen in November 1993.
		<p>
		During the election campaign, allegations of sexual and financial misconduct were traded by those in power and the opposition.  Of the 12 MPs elected on polling day, seven were incumbents, two had previously been members and three were newcomers to Parliament.  Among the successful incumbents were caretaker Prime Minister Bikenibeu Paeniu and Speaker Tomasi Puapua; former Prime Minister Kamuta Laatasi, however, lost his seat.  Two opposition MPs were returned.  While there are no formal parties in Tuvalu, the political system is based on a web of alliances and loyalties derived from clan and family roots.
		<p>
		On April 8, the newly elected Parliament convened and elected Mr. Paeniu as Prime Minister for a second consecutive term; he named his new Cabinet the following day.</td>

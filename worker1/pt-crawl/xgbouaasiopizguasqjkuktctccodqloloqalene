<H2>History of Dhofar</H2>

<p>There are many possible ways to write down a name that is spelled in the original Arabic as "&#x0638;&#x0641;&#x0627;&#x0631;" (that&#x2019;s <i>zah</i>, <i>feh</i>, <i>alif</i>, and <i>reh</i>; also "&#x00D0;far" or "&#x1E92;uf&#x0101;r").<br>
<i>Ant&#x00F3;nio Martins-Tuv&#x00E1;lkin</i>, 23 February 2012</p>

<p>Dr. Smith helps to clarify the Dhofar situation in his article in
[<A HREF="bib-smi.html#smi95k">smi95k</A>] (Flag Bulletin XXXIV:6/167, Nov-Dec 1995):<br>
Despite the autonomy from central rule which various regions in Oman
exercised in the past, none of the provinces had officially recognized flags of
their own. Unofficially, however, Dhofar, whose capital, Salalah, lies more than
1000 km by sea from Muscat, has had a number of flags expressing local
self-rule. In the early 19th century, for example, it was successively under the
control of Muhammad Aqil and an American known as Abdullah Lorleyd, who relied
heavily on the Mahra tribe for support. Neverthless representatives from Dhofar
traveled to Muscat in 1856, 1866, and 1871 to proclaim publicly their loyalty to
the new sultans who acceded to power in those years. Those delegations each
received a flag, presumably the <A HREF="om_musca.html">plain red national flag</A>
of Muscat and Oman.<br>
In early 1876 Seyyid Fadhl ibn-Alawi al-Husaini was able to win allegiance of
the Mahras and establish control over the province. Rather than proclaiming
Dhofar independent, however, he announced that it was a dependency of "the
Supreme Empire" &#x2013; that is, the <A HREF="tr-ottom.html">Ottoman Empire</A> which
was then the largest and most powerful Muslim state in the world. This was an
era when the Turks and the British were fighting for control over Arab
sheikhdoms from <A HREF="kw.html">Kuwait</A> and other states along the Persian
Gulf to the Hadramaut (modern <A HREF="ye.html">Yemen</A>) and Asir, an Arab
kingdom north of Yemen. Fadhl's allegiance to Turkey and his animosity towards
Britain may have been based in part on experiences his family had in
British-ruled India. Ironically, Fadhl turned to the British political agent at
Aden in 1877, to protest the use by unregistered vessels of the red flag of the
Ottoman Empire. Fadhl continued to rule Dhofar until January 1879 when he was
deposed by local people unhappy with his rule. Although Sultan Said spent much
of his reign (1932-1970) in Salalah, his rule did not extend to the hinterland
and indeed his presence may have spurred local discontent. <br>
In 1964 the Front for the Liberation of Dhofar (FLD) was established to
resist the sultan and the British forces which supported him. Many of the Jabali
tribe, who had served in the Trucial Scouts in what is today the
<A HREF="ae.html">United Arab Emirates</A>, wanted a more progressive government
in their homeland. At this time also international events were changing
alliances on the Arabian peninsula as Britain retreated from world-wide
commitments it could no longer afford, especially after the Suez Canal debacle
in 1956. Attempting to exploit the polarization created by the Cold War,
"anti-imperialist" forces in Dhofar allied themselves with political
organizations which sought to liberate neighboring <A HREF="ye_brit.html">Aden</A>
and the British-protected feudal inland states and which drew on financial and
logistic support from Communist countries. <br>

<i>Christian Bergh&#x00E4;nel</i>, 16 February 2003</p>

<p>Dhufar is the southern- and westernmost part of Oman, located on the
south coast of Oman. It's the furthest from north-east coast, with the
capital Muscat, that one can get while staying within the country; in
fact, it's even further away from Muscat than Musandam and Madha are,
which are parts of Oman one can only get to by leaving the country.<br>
Where the northeastern part of Oman is on a virtual island in the
Persian Gulf, only connected to the mainland by the same lower area that
makes up most of the UAE as well, Dhufar, on the other side of this
divide, is part of a ridge stretching into Yemen, basically the
mountains of Hadramaut. Its population, divided from the north-east by
those near uninhabited lowlands, is mainly settled in the stretch of
land between the mountain ridge and the sea. This habitation pattern
crosses the Yemen border, continuing in Mahra. Water courses cross the
border with Yemen, not the divide. Even Dhufar locusts swarm into Yemen,
not to the rest of Oman. So the people from Dhufar may have
reasons not to feel closely connected to the north-east of Oman.<br>

<p>According to <i>Andr&#x00E9; Flicher</i>, all three flags are ~1:2 red-white-black
horizontal tribands  (a common <a href="xo-arabc.html#lib">motif of the area</a>);
in 1968 the order or the stripes changed from red on top to black on
top (the white in the middle didn't change), and in 1972 red lettering was
added to the middle stripe, reading (if I didn&#x2019;t mess up the Arabic)
"&#x0627;&#x0644;&#x062C;&#x0628;&#x0647;&#x0629; &#x0627;&#x0644;&#x0634;&#x0639;&#x0628; &#x0644;&#x062A;&#x062D;&#x0631;&#x064A;&#x0631; &#x063A;&#x0645;&#x0627;&#x0646;" ("Aljbh&#x1E97; Al&#x015D;&#x0295;b Lt&#x0127;rir &#x0295;&#x1D58;man"), which means
"Omani People's Liberation Front" (I think there's a missing <i>alef</i> at
the beggining of the 3rd word).<br>
Considering this text, it seems unlikely that this is a markedly
regional(ist) Dhofar flag, but rather an <A HREF="om.html">Omani</A> flag &#x2014; surely before
1972 <A HREF="om_musca.html">Muscat and Oman</A> was markedly macrocephalic towards the latter,
and the emergent Omani lobby would have more supporters in this
southeastern, mainland area&#x2026;<br>

<p>Not surprisingly, the Dhofar rebels borrowed for their own use the flag of
the National Liberation Front, which in November 1967 was able to seize control
of the area it called South Yemen &#x2013; a horizontal tricolor of red, white, black.<br>

<p>In early 1968 the Dhofar rebels changed the name of their organization to the
Peoples Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Arabian Gulf (PFLOAG). Their
emblem, showing an arm holding an AK-47 rifle in red, had a background with a
map delineating the territory they hoped to liberate, including what are now the
independent states of <A HREF="bh.html">Bahrain</A>, <A HREF="qa.html">Qatar</A>, the
<A HREF="ae.html">United Arab Emirates</A>, and <A HREF="om.html">Oman</A>. With a
secure supply base in the new <A HREF="ye-south.html">People's Democratic Republic of South Yemen</a>, the PFLOAG rebels presented considerable threat not only to Dhofar but the rest of the sultanate.<br>

<p>The withdrawal of the British from the Persian Gulf region in
1971 encouraged Sultan Qaboos to move quickly to suppress the Dhofar revolt. He
brought in troops from Iran but he also sought to win the allegiance of the
disaffected tribes in Dhofar. In contrast to the rebel leadership, he stressed
his allegiance to Muslim values and, in contrast to his father, promised to work
for the independence and development of the country.<br>

<p>According to a German text (from <A HREF="bib-fba.html#fbn"><i>Flaggenmitteilungen</i></A> ?) submitted by <i>Jaume Oll&#x00E9;</i>, "the flag of the People's Front for the Liberation of Oman is striped black-white-red; in the white field the inscription: ALJABHA ALSHA'BIYAH LITAHRIR OMAN in red."<i><br>
Jarig Bakker</i>, 11 September 1999</p>

<p>By the time the rebels
disavowed interest in the Arabian gulf states in 1975, renaming their party the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman (PFLO), Sultan Qaboos had effectively
defeated them militarily. The PFLO flag added the name of the party in red
Arabic script to the center stripe of the red-white-black tricolor they had used
previously as the FLD and PFLOAG. Evidence is lacking to suggest that this flag
was ever displayed in Oman outside Dhofar.<br>

<b>Pre-colonial era</b><br><br>

<img src="/web/20070620120119im_/http://helicopterseychelles.com/images/history_of_seychelles_flags02.gif" width="115" height="150" align="left" hspace="0" border="1"><img src="/web/20070620120119im_/http://helicopterseychelles.com/images/trans.gif" width="5" height="150" align="left" hspace="0" border="0">

Nautical historians believe the Pheonicians and Greeks were the first
civilizations to visit the Seychelles. However, the first recorded proof
was a map transcribed by the Arabs in 1505.<br><br>

The era of piracy upon popular trading routes
of both the French and British grew into a frenzy between 1794 and 1811.

These deputised pirates, or privateers, reeked chaos along the
Euro-India trade routes.

The privateers, or corsairs, were hired by a government to torment the 
shipping lanes of rival governments. Thus, a wide variety of flags, pending
where you were from or who you worked for, surfaced throughout the region.<br clear="all"><br>

<b>Colonial era</b><br><br>

It is widely documented that Seychelles was named after the French
finance minister Jean Moreau de Sechelles in 1756.<br><br>

During the time of French rule, as of 1756, possibly either the French flag,
or perhaps a French colonial flag was in use, as was the case in
other French colonies at the time.<br><br>

In 1814 the British controlled Mauritius, by default due to the Seychelles
dependency on Mauritius, it also fell under British control, at this time,
the Union Jack became the official flag of Seychelles.<br><br>

In 1903 Seychelles separated from Mauritius and become a
republic within the commonwealth administrated by
the British Colonial Governor. From here on, three slightly
different colonial flags has been in use, two of which had 
the writing "Finis Coronat Opus" in its emblems,
meaning "The End Crowns the Work", which still today is
a national motto.<br clear="all"><br>

<b>Seychelles independence</b><br><br>

In 1976 Seychelles become independent from the British
Commonwealth, a coalition government was
formed by the two leading parties with James Mancham of SDP
(Seychelles Democratic Party) as president, and Albert Ren� of
SPUP (Seychelles People's United Party) as prime minister.
The flag pictured on the right which was introduced at the time,
lasted only until 1977.<br clear="all"><br>

<i>Meaning of the colours: 1) The two main political parties.
The former Democratic Party, blue and white, and the Seychelles People's
United Party, red and white. 2) The British and the French who once
ruled the islands.</i><br clear="all"><br>

Following a coup in 1977, Seychelles became a one-party state
headed by Albert Ren� as president.
The design of the national flag was based on the SPUP
party symbol.<br><br>

The party subsequently renamed itself to SPPF
(Seychelles People's Progressive Front) as it is known today. 
The flag including the sun was retained as party symbol and removed from
the national flag, indicating that the sun of freedom shines over
the country.<br><br>

<i>Description of the flag: The red stands for progress and revolution, green
for earth and agriculture, white wavy bar for the waves which bathe the
island's beaches and the resources which are abtained from the Indian Ocean.</i><br clear="all"><br><br>

The current flag was introduced on 18th June 1996 at the time of the
re-introduction of the multiparty system. This day is now a
national holiday celebrating independence.<br><br>

A <a href="seychelles_national_anthem.mp3">national anthem</a> was
introduced at the same time, entitled "Koste Seselwa", which is creole for
"come together all Seychellois".<br><br>

Seychelles is now governed by a democratically elected party. For 27
years, under the loyal service of President Albert Ren� and vice
president James A. Michel, the SPPF party has paved the way for this
country's future.<br><br>

In April 2004 James Michel resumed control as the
new president of the Seychelles. A dedicated Mr Ren� continues today
to energise the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070620120119/http://www.sppf.sc/" target="_parent">SPPF</a>
which he formed in 1964.<br><br>

The flag represents a dynamic young country moving into the future.<br><br>

<i>The colour blue depicts the sky and the sea that surrounds the Seychelles.
Yellow is for the sun which gives light and life, red symbolises the people
and their determination to work for the future in unity and love, whilst
the white band represents social justice and harmony. The green depicts the
land and natural environment.</i><br clear="all"><br>

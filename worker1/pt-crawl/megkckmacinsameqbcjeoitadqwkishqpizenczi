<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhys Isaac's Pulitzer Prize-winning study of cultural change in
eighteenth-century Virginia has become a  landmark of cultural history
since it first appeared seventeen years ago.  Isaac's imaginative blend of
history and symbolic anthropology, coupled with his compelling account of
Virginia's complementary political and cultural revolutions, has extended
<I>The Transformation of Virginia's</I> influence beyond history into the fields
of anthropology, religion, politics, the law, and social psychology.  The
book has inspired many subsequent historians to incorporate ethnography
into their methods of inquiry, contributing to a proliferation of
sophisticated new scholarship in cultural history.  Isaac celebrates this
flourishing diversity of "ethnographic everybody's history" in the new
preface to this reissued paperback edition of his masterpiece, while
lamenting that the new cultural history's "multiplicity of would-be
paradigms" has left the field "in a state of confusing fragmentation."
Isaac expresses confidence that the "force and clarity" of his
path-breaking venture into ethnographic history assures the book "a
continuing role in the furtherance of gender- and race-inclusive history"
(xxvi).  Yet insofar as that confidence rests on the hope of bringing order
out of current paradigmatic chaos, it may well have been betrayed by
Isaac's decision to leave the limitations of his method and analysis
unaddressed by revision.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



Isaac's account of Virginia's historical transformation will be familiar to
many readers and needs only a brief summary here.  He begins his story in

dominance on the landscape through stately English-designed great houses,
imposing county courthouses, and elegant parish churches.  They reinforced
their place in the social hierarchy through rituals of power and submission
that permeated county life from court day festivities to convivial
gatherings in taverns and gentry homes.  Yet they secured that social world
only to face the militant challenge of Presbyterians, Baptists, and
eventually Methodists whose  "evangelical counterculture" (p. 164)
threatened to wrest popular affection from the gentry and introduce a
radical egalitarianism into Virginia social life.  Indeed, evangelicals
seemed to lay the axe at the very root of Virginia's social tree by the
antislavery preaching of some extreme leaders and the subversive practice
of admitting black slaves into full church fellowship.  Baptist itinerants
transformed sites of gentry hegemony into theaters of intense cultural
conflict.   At the height of this contest, the patriot movement broke out,
threatening to engulf the gentry in a wave of popular tumult.
Paradoxically, however, popular resistance to British measures offered
desperate gentry spokesmen the opportunity to salvage their status by
throwing themselves into the cause, a "defensive response to the open
rejection of deference that was increasingly manifested in the spread of
evangelicalism" (265).  This move exacted its price in the erosion of
Virginia's hierarchical society and the incursion of a new ethos of
voluntarism and privatism.  Even slaves increasingly embraced new
evangelical forms as the core of their communal life.
	
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


In his preface, Isaac observes that "there have not been great
controversies among early Americanists over my ethnographic interpretation
of the American Revolution" (xxx).  His narrative is largely confirmed, in
his view, by the "odd combination of obvious and idiosyncratic" new works
he cites as having the potential to influence his book were he to write it
today--studies ranging from Dell Upton's architectural history <I>Holy Things
and Profane</I> to Inga Clendinnen's dramaturgic study <I>Aztecs</I> to Philip
Morgan's investigations of colonial slavery, which recently culminated in
the publication of <I>Slave Counterpoint</I>.
	

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Largely absent from Isaac's list of new histories, however, are the many
innovative studies of early American religious life that have appeared
since 1982, the bulk of which tend to confirm persistent criticisms of
Isaac's interpretation and methodology.  Many of the book's original
reviewers questioned the decisiveness of the Baptist challenge.  They noted
the deep and genuine commitment of many gentry to the patriot cause, while
pointing out that pre-Revolutionary Baptists never exceeded ten percent of
the population and were most active far from the centers of patriot
activism.  Recent studies of Southern religious life add force to this
critique, generally confirming Christine Leigh Heyrman's findings in <I>Southern Cross</I> that Virginians and other Southerners of every social group resolutely resisted the small cadre of evangelical radicals well into the
nineteenth century.  Southern stubbornness eventually forced the
evangelicals to accommodate to Southern culture to win converts, including
adopting restrictions on the interracial practices which had never sat
comfortably with members of the ruling race.
		
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


In fact, Isaac's treatment of causality in Virginia history remains <I>The
Transformation of Virginia's</I> central weakness, one which stems both from
his focus on dramaturgy as the interpretive key to history and from his
implicitly progressive narrative framework.  Isaac shapes his analysis of
Virginia's "social theater" into a narrative wherein a monolithic
traditional gentry culture of hierarchy and subordination had to defend
itself against an equally monolithic culture of proto-democratic
egalitarianism, in the end acquiescing to a post-Revolutionary world more
recognizably modern than that of 1740.  The gentry's own part in bringing
that world about--observable in behaviors such as participation in
transatlantic print culture, construction of houses with hallways and
private rooms, immersion in eighteenth-century consumer culture--fits
poorly into this interpretive scheme.  Indeed, while Isaac's eye is trained
upon the dramaturgical performances that yield such elegant thick
descriptions of Virginia's social life and customs, the deepest causes of
Virginia's cultural transformation--the transatlantic economic and social
changes periodically visible in the background of his analysis--seem to
escape his notice.  His focus on the oppositions between gentry and
evangelical cultures also blinds Isaac to the economic and social interests
which united most white Virginians in support of slavery.
	

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<I>The Transformation of Virginia</I> remains an imaginatively conceived and
elegantly written "monument to a moment" when early American history and
symbolic anthropology first met (xxv).  Yet in its tendency to exaggerate
cultural polarization, Isaac's particular brand of "ethnographic
everybody's history" ultimately seems more suited to perpetuating than
mending the historiographical fragmentation he so laments.  It also leaves
him poorly equipped to explain the limitations of a transformation that
left many elite planter families at the top of Virginia society and kept
evangelical slaves in their quarters until the Civil War.

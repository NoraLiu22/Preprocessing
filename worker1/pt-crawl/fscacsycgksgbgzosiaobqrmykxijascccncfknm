      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Concerning the Catechism<br>
        </b>This catechism is primarily intended for use by parish priests, deacons, and lay catechists, to give an outline for instruction. It 
        is a commentary on the creeds, but is not meant to be a complete statement of belief and practices; rather, it is a point of departure 
        for the teacher, and it is cast in the traditional question and answer form for ease of reference.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second use of this catechism is to provide a brief summary of the Church's 
        teaching for an inquiring stranger who picks up a Prayer Book.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It may also be used to form a simple service; since the matter is arranged 
        under headings, it is suitable for selective use, and the leader may introduce prayers and hymns as needed.</font></p>

          A. We are part of God's creation, made in the image of God.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What does it mean to be created in the image of God?<br>
          A. It means that we are free to make choices: to love, to create, to reason, and to live in harmony with creation and with God.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. Why then do we live apart from God and out of harmony with creation?<br>
          A. From the beginning, human beings have misused their freedom and made wrong choices.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. Why do we not use our freedom as we should?<br>
          A. Because we rebel against God, and we put ourselves in the place of God.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What help is there for us?<br>
          A. Our help is in God.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. How did God first help us?<br>
          A. God first helped us by revealing himself and his will, through nature and history, through many seers and saints, and especially 
          the prophets of Israel.</font></p>

          </b>Q. What do we learn about God as creator from the revelation to Israel?<br>
          A. We learn that there is one God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What does this mean?<br>
          A. This means that the universe is good, that it is the work of a single loving God who creates, sustains, and directs it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What does this mean about our place in the universe?<br>
          A. It means that the world belongs to its creator; and that we are called to enjoy it and to care for it in accordance with God's purposes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What does this mean about human life?<br>
          A. It means that all people are worthy of respect and honor, because all are created in the image of God, and all can respond to the 
          love of God.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. How was this revelation handed down to us?<br>
          A. This revelation was handed down to us through a community created by a covenant with God.</font></p>

          </b>Q. What is meant by a covenant with God?<br>
          A. A covenant is a relationship initiated by God, to which a body of people responds in faith.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What is the Old Covenant?<br>
          A. The Old Covenant is the one given by God to the Hebrew people.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What did God promise them?<br>
          A. God promised that they would be his people to bring all the nations of the world to him.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What response did God require from the chosen people?<br>
          A. God required the chosen people to be faithful; to love justice, to do mercy, and to walk humbly with their God.</font></p>

          </b>Q. What are the Ten Commandments?<br>
          A. The Ten Commandments are the laws given to Moses and the people of Israel.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What do we learn from these commandments?<br>
          A. We learn two things: our duty to God, and our duty to our neighbors.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What is our duty to God?<br>
          A. Our duty is to believe and trust in God;</font> </p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What is our duty to our neighbors? <br>
          A. Our duty to our neighbors is to love them as ourselves, and to do to other people as we wish them to do to us;</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">V To love, honor, and help our parents and family; to honor those in

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What is the purpose of the Ten Commandments? <br>
          A. The Ten Commandments were given to define our relationship with God and our neighbors.</font></p>

          </b>Q. What is sin? <br>
          A. Sin is the seeking of our own will instead of the will of God, thus distorting our relationship with God, with other people, and 
          with all creation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. How does sin have power over us? <br>
          A. Sin has power over us because we lose our liberty when our relationship with God is distorted.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What is redemption? <br>
          A. Redemption is the act of God which sets us free from the power of evil, sin, and death.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. How did God prepare us for redemption? <br>
          A. God sent the prophets to call us back to himself, to show us our need for redemption, and to announce the coming of the Messiah.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. What is meant by the Messiah? <br>
          A. The Messiah is one sent by God to free us from the power of sin, so that with the help of God we may live in harmony with God, within 
          ourselves, with our neighbors, and with all creation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. Who do we believe is the Messiah? <br>

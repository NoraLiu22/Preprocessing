<a NAME="mea"></a>Symbolism of the flag</h3>
<p>The green represents Country's vegetation and land resources. The yellow
represents the country's mineral wealth. The red represents the blood spilt
during the liberation struggle. Black represents the black majority. The
<a href="#emb">Zimbabwe Bird</a> is the National Emblem of Zimbabwe. The white triangle stands for peace
and the "way forward". The Red Star stands for internationalism (and reflects the
ruling party's socialist credentials).

<p>A leaflet from the Ministry of Information, Posts and Telecommunications, Causeway,
Zimbabwe (Printed by the Government Printer, Harare) in July 1983 gives the
following explanation for the colours and symbols of the Zimbabwean flag:<br>
<br>
Page 1 shows the flag (with irregular star!) and page 2 provides a graphical explanation of the
various elements of the flag:<br>
black stripe - for the black majority.<br>
red stripe - blood spilled during the armed struggle.<br>
yellow stripe - the country's mineral wealth.<br>
green stripe - the vegetation and agriculture.<br>
white triangle - peace.<br>
red star - the nation's aspirations.<br>
yellow bird - the national emblem.<br>
<i>&#381;eljko Heimer</i>, 02 May 2004</p>
<p>The colours of the flag of Zimbabwe are based on those of the flag of the 
ruling party, the <a href="zw}.html#zanu">Zimbabwe African National Union 
(Patriotic Front )</a> (ZANU(PF). The party flag has a central panel of
black. This was bordered outwards to the edge by rings of red, yellow and green. 
If you look at the order of the stripes on the Zimbabwe flag, you will see that 
they follow this same sequence.<br>
<br>
The white triangle is for peace. The red star is for socialism. The Zimbabwe 
Bird is the national emblem.<br>

<p>
Attached to the Act I have received from Christopher Southworth is a coloured drawing of the flag (larger then the
one in the actual Schedule), with construction lines dawn into it, but with no figures. I believe that this is not a part of the official document,
but somebody's (possibly William Crampton's?) study of the flag. Anyway, from
this Chris got the construction details which I have interpreted as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seven equal horizontal stripes 18 units each in 1:2 flag, i.e. 126 x 252 units.<br>
The white triangle is isosceles with base at hoist and height of 84 units. It is fimbriated outside this toward fly with black stripe
with a width of 3 units. This fimbriation merges with the central black stripe.
The Great Zimbabwe Bird emblem is 40 units long and 46 units high. The distance from hoist to the emblem is 16 units, from top 36 units
(and then from bottom is 44 units). The star is constructed with a center in a point 34 units from hoist
on the horizontal median.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The star is constructed with the help of four imaginary concentric circles (with center in the point described above) with radii of 32,
27.5, 16 and 13 units. If one numbers the points (including the "inner points") with number 1 though 10, where 1 is the topmost point
and proceeding clockwise (well, the orientation is of no matter there since the star is vertically 
symmetrical) then the points are on the
radii as follows 1:32, 2:16, 3:32, 4:13, 5:27.5, 6:13, 7:27.5, 8:13, 9:32, 10:16, each being 36 degrees from the other.
While there is the black fimbriation on the bird, there is no black lines outlining the red star.</p>
<p>The most important thing to note here is that the red star is not a regular one, but has rays of various length, as shall be seen from
the construction sheet.<br>

<p>The copy of the Zimbabwe Flag Act sent to &#381;eljko was taken from the Flag Institute files, but the
colour picture was obtained later. I'm afraid that the scribbles on it are mine
and not William Crampton's, so any errors drawn from them are down to me.<br>

<p>The photo of the flag in the picture with President Mugabe shows the star and
Bird with different specifications to that in the construction sheet (outlined
above).<br>
<i>Jaume Olle</i>, 30 Nov 2003<br>
<br>
Checking the Shipmate flag chart made under the auspices of the Flag Research
Centre, it seems to me that it also has the irregular star. On the other hand, Graham Bartram's
site shows the regular star.&nbsp;<br>
<i>&#381;eljko Heimer</i>, 01 Dec 2003<br>
<br>
This leads us into the <i> de facto</i> versus <i> de jure</i> nature of flags, flag design
and specifications. This question over the official star design could probably be answered best by a flag manufacturer in Harare.
I do know that at least two, if not three, major US manufacturers use flags with the star design shown in Jaume's photo.<br>
<i>Paige Herring</i>, 02 Dec 2003
</p>
<p>I don't think that it can be any secret that I'm firmly on the side of <i>de
jure</i> when it comes to specifying flags, but that aside, I'm afraid that I must disagree quite strongly with Paige over the above suggestion.<br>
<br>
No disrespect to flag manufacturers whatsoever, but it seems to me that they quite often rely on the committed and experienced vexillologist to provide
them with information (which is as it should be), rather than the other way around? On the other hand, I would suggest that one question which could
quite properly be asked of the flag manufacturers in Harare is - 'do you have any official information which post-dates that in our possession', but
I would also suggest that this is a question which is far better directed to the Government department concerned?<br>
<br>
Again with no disrespect intended to either flag manufacturers (or indeed to Paige), but I would think that the
majority of equally reputable British flag manufacturers also show the flag of
Zimbabwe with an even star (I am<br>
only certain of one), but this still makes it incorrect according to the only
official information we have.<br>
<i>Christopher Southworth</i>, 03 Dec 2003<br>
<br>
I have a Zimbabwe flag made in the 1980s by William Smith &amp; Gourock, a Harare flag maker which supplied flags to the
government. The star on that flag is the more standard shape (as used on US flags), not the broad star shown in &#381;eljko's
schematic.<br>

provides recommendations for national flag designs. Each National Olympic 
Committee was sent an image of their flag, including the PMS shades, by the 
London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) for their approval. 
Once this was obtained, the LOCOG produced a 60 x 90 cm version of the flag for 
further approval. So, while these specifications may not be the official, 
government, version of each flag, they are certainly what the National Olympic 
Committee believed their flag to be. <br>

For Zimbabwe : PMS 355 green, 102 yellow, 032 red and black. The vertical flag

<span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Following the recent discussion on 
how the Great Zimbabwe Bird should be displayed on the flags of Zimbabwe and 
on that of it's immediate predecessor, Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, I now submit an enlarged detail 
of this emblem as it is *actually* portrayed on flags made in Zimbabwe. (An 
image of the flag with this design of the Zimbabwe Bird is shown
<a href="zw_index.html">here</a>). It must 
be 
noted here however, that the style shown here is contradictory to the version 
shown on the official specifications. The origins of the graphical style 
illustrated here and used on the flags made in Zimbabwe can 
be traced back to the Coat of Arms of <a href="zw-rhod.html">Rhodesia</a>, which were set upon the white 
stripe of the vertical tricolour of green-white-green, the Bird being in-chief.<br>
<br>
It is too easy to duplicate errors in flag graphics (as we learn time and time 
again on Flags of the World), and my own personal feeling on this matter is that when the 
official
specifications were drawn up, the bird was incorrectly depicted and therefore the mistake 
has 
repeated by several vexillologists through the years. Flag manufacturers 
seldom look into the accurate detailing that the flag-fanatic notices and  
are quite happy to &quot;go-along&quot; with what the *official* specification sheets at 
their disposal show. Thus flags made outside of Zimbabwe, and shown in a great 
many flag books, shown the version of the Bird as found on the specification 
sheet.<br>
<br>
Legend amongst Zimbabwe's black population has it that there were originally 
seven Soapstone Birds at the Great Zimbabwe Ruins, all of 
which had mysteriously been taken out of the country.&nbsp; Only four have since 
been returned.
It is said that peace will never return to Zimbabwe until all seven of these 
artifacts have been returned to their rightful place. <br>

<p>
The Great Zimbabwe Bird is the national emblem of Zimbabwe.&nbsp; It is found on 
the country's coat of arms, banknotes and coins.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is used by the 
national sports teams and is part of numerous badges and logos of various 
institutions and organisations. As Martin points out, the design of the Bird is 
not always exactly the same as seen from the flag specifications, the version on 
the currency and on the coat of arms etc.&nbsp; An example of a variation in the 
design is that used as the fin flash for the <a href="zw^airf.html">Air Force of Zimbabwe</a> as shown 
below.</p>

<p>
The origin of the emblem are a number of soapstone carvings found at the Great 
Zimbabwe Ruins.&nbsp; The&nbsp; ruins are an Iron Age site 27km south-east of 
the town of Masvingo in the centre of the country and is the remains of a town 
built between 1200 and 1450 AD. The word 'zimbabwe' is derived from the Shona 
words <i>dzimba dza mabwe</i> and means &quot;house of stone&quot;. Archaeologists and 
historians believe that from the 13th to 15th centuries Great Zimbabwe was the 
capital of a large area in southern Africa.&nbsp; Throughout the area there are 
a number of smaller but similar ruins.<br>
<i>Bruce Berry</i>, 04 June 2005</p>
<p>
Great Zimbabwe National monument was inscribed on the <a href="unesco.html">UNESCO</a> World Heritage 
List, with the following notice.<br>
<br>
The ruins of Great Zimbabwe � the capital of the Queen of Sheba, according to an 
age-old legend � are a unique testimony to the Bantu civilization of the Shona 
between the 11th and 15th centuries. The city, which covers an area of nearly 80 
ha, was an important trading centre and was renowned from the Middle Ages 
onwards.<br>
<br>
The Great Enclosure, which has the form of an ellipsis, is located to the south 
of the hills and dates to the 14th century. It was built of cut granite blocks, 
laid in regular courses, and contains a series of daga-hut living quarters, a 
community area, and a narrow passage leading to a high conical tower. The bricks 
(daga) were made from a mixture of granitic sand and clay. Huts were built 
within the stone enclosure walls; inside each community area other walls mark 
off each family's area, generally comprising a kitchen, two living huts and a 
court.<br>

<p>I was in Zimbabwe in 1998 and was looking in Harare for a national flag. I 
found a big flag manufacturer and was lucky to find flags of good quality. As

<p>Thanks for the photos, the original stone bird does look interesting
while the photo of the flag enables me to redraw the bird and the star.<br>
<br>
According to my assessment from the photo and using the overall size
of the flag as 126 x 252 as we have in our previous construction sheets
for comparison, the star is inscribed in a circle with diameter
about 60 units and its center slightly moved upwards (3 units). The
bird dimensions are approximately 27x36 units, center of this square being about 3 
units toward the fly from the center of the circle.<br>

<p>The green shield represents the fertility of our soil while the blue
and white wavy lines symbolise the water which brings prosperity. The representation
of Great Zimbabwe stands for the historical heritage of the nation. The
rifle and hoe represent the transition from war to peace. The wreath is
formed of twisted strips of gold and green silk, and represents the mining
and agricultural enterprise which protects our national economy. This supports
the crest in which the star is an ancient symbol of hope for the future,
tinctured red to remind us of the suffering of all our peoples and the
need to avoid any recurrence of that suffering. The star bears the 
<a href="#emb">Great
Zimbabwe Bird </a>which has become our distinctive national emblem. The kudu
in their natural colours display a harmonious blend of black, white and
brown which may be taken to symbolise the unity of purpose of the various
ethnic groups which comprise the people of this country. The earthen mound
bears the plants which give food and clothing to the people and the motto
reminds us of our need to maintain a desire for national unity and the
will to work, in order to preserve the freedom which we enjoy.

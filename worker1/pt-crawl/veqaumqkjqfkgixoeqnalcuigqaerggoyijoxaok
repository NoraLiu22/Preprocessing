<p>The shield is a kind of heraldic map illustrating the County Borough's name (<i>Where the valleys meet the mountains of Gwent</i>). The six white and green waves represent the
three main valleys and rivers of Sirhowy, Ebbw and Clydach where all the five former
constituent areas lie. The three indentations at the top of the shield allude to the mountains above which are the three gold fleurs-de-lys on blue and black from
the ancient arms of the Kingdom of Gwent and the modern arms of the Gwent (formerly Monmouthshire) County Council.<br>
The white and green of the wreath are the colours of the Tudors and of Wales. The red dragon is like those in the crests of Ebbw Vale UDC and Crickhowell RDC. The mound of coal, collar of steel, flames and pair of millrolls symbolise the main
local industries, and is carried on in the supporters.</p>

<p>The red dragon is the well-known emblem of Wales it holds a standard bearing the arms attributed to Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the last Prince of Glamorgan. The banner also links to the arms used by Cardiff before it obtained its grant, namely the three red chevrons on gold of the Clare Lords of Glamorgan. Thus the Welsh and Norman history of the City is suggested. The leek is, of course, the floral emblem ofWales, and the traditional origin of the leek as a Welsh emblem is the battle of Poictiers. According to Fluellen in Shakespeare's <i>Henry V</i> 'the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps.' An alternative theory is that the true Welsh emblem is not the vegetable leek, but 'St Peter's Leek' - the daffodil.<br> 
The ostrich feathers are the famous badge of the Princes of Wales, and their use was specially authorized by Royal Warrant. The Tudor rose is taken from an old Corporation seal and the mural crown is a symbol of civic government.<br>
The goat represents the mountains of Glamorgan, and the sea-horse stands for the Severn Sea and the port, whereby their mineral wealth is distributed to the world.<br>
The complete achievement depicts the status of the City and County of Cardiff as the Capital City of Wales and its commercial position linking the mountains with the sea. The crest and the Royal Badges on the supporters show the special Royal favours to the City as well as its fealty to the Crown.</p>

The Choughs in the arms, although designated in the official blazon as Cornish Choughs, were undoubtedly widely distributed throughout Wales in earlier times and are properly regarded as Celtic.<br>

The white bull is derived from the heraldry of the Bulkeleys of Beaumaris, and with its collar of seaweed, typifies the agricultural and seafaring activities of the island. The black heraldic tiger is a supporter of the arms of the Marquess of Anglesey, and his collar of oak refers to Anglesey's former position as the stronghold of the Druids to whom the tree is sacred.</p>

<p>The central motif is a likeness of St. Tydfil. The town  owes its name to Tydfil the daughter of Brychan, a 5th Century Chieftain, who had been converted to Christianity. One of her brothers, Cadoc, became the Patron Saint of Brittany. Tydfil and her family were massacred by a band of marauding Picts and Saxons about AD 480 and it is generally believed that she died on the site of the Parish Church, which bears her name.  The shrine of St. Tydfil the Martyr soon became a place of Christian pilgrimage and as the years passed by a village grew up around it. The distaff she is bearing in her hands signifies the industrial history of the County Borough of Merthyr Tydfil, and the crosses pat�e fitch�e, resembling daggers are meant to remind us of how she met her death.<br>

<p>The shield is divided per chevron three times as a reference to the three chevronels of the Clare family, Earls of Gloucester descended from Robert Earl of Gloucester (illegitimate son of Henry I) who founded Neath and Margam Abbeys and whose family became Lords of the Manor of Glamorgan. Three chevronels are also said to be the arms of Iestyn ap Gwrgan (living 1083-93) ruler of Glamorgan. The three chevronels occurred in the shield and badge of the former <a href="wales_7496.html#west glamorgan cc">West Glamorgan County Council</a> and the shield of the former <a href="wales_7496.html#port talbot bc">Borough of Port Talbot</a>.
The silver roundel charged with a black cogwheel uses the colours of the arms of the former <a href="wales_7496.html#neath bc">Borough of Neath</a>. The black relates to the coal, oil and manufacturing industries and the silver to metal industries. Cogwheels featured in the crests of the former West Glamorgan County Council and in the former <a href="wales_7496.html#lliw valley bc">Borough of Lliw Valley</a>.<br>
The Cistercian monk in the crest refers to the Cistercian Abbeys of Neath and Margam and it formed part of the crest of Neath. The monk emerges from a black mural crown as in the crest of the former Lliw Valley. The crown is also a reference to the black and white towers in the arms of the former Neath. The monk holds a clarion, an emblem said to have been used as a punning Badge by the Clare family. Three clarions were used on early seals by the Abbeys of Margam and Neath. The origins of this heraldic emblem are obscure but it may possibly represent a portable organ and in modern times it has certainly been used as a symbol of music. It represents not only the Clare family but the importance of music locally and throughout Wales. It appears prominently in the arms and crest of the former Port Talbot, but the musical allusion is made in the Neath arms by a harp.<br>
Two Welsh dragons serve appropriately as supporters. The dragon occurred in the former West Glamorgan crest and in the supporters of the former Neath and former Lliw Valley crests. They hold cords of the livery colours from which are suspended the two hybrid emblems from the arms of the former West Glamorgan namely a green pine cone (for forestry and the countryside) dimidiating a black droplet (for oil refining and connected industries). The dragons wear mural crowns round their necks as a reference to their civic nature. They stand on a grassy compartment set with Welsh daffodils and stylised waves of white and green as in the arms and badge of the former Lliw Valley and part of the former West Glamorgan compartment (where they are white and blue).<p>

<p>These arms were in use before 1929, when they were officially confirmed. They are based on the red chevron on gold which formed the arms of the family De Stafford, the Earls of Stafford and Dukes of Buckingham having held the lordship of Newport in the 14th and 15th centuries  - but the reversed chevron marks the difference between these Borough Anns and those of the family. The use of the cherub above the shield is unusual, It is not known whether the cherub was intended to have any significance when it was adopted, but it is believed to be merely decorative.<br>
The supporters indicate that Monmouthshire, including Newport, had been for some centuries alternately officially designated either as part of England or part of Wales. Their animal and fish parts, and the fact that they are winged, make them also representative of strength on land, sea and in the air.<br>
The motto echos the symbolism of the supporters.

<p>The early history of the Arms of Swansea is obscure. An unfounded legend has it that the original device was an Osprey, which now forms the present crest and also the present badge of the Lord Mayor. Between 1632 and 1922, the Seal of the Council bore a portcullis of eight bars, probably derived from the Crest of Arms of the Somerset family, who had been Lords of Gower. The portcullis is also depicted on the ceremonial maces of the Borough, which date from 1753, and on other items from this period. This suggests that the portcullis may have been regarded as the insignia of the Borough during this period.<br>
In January 1843, the General Purposes Committee of the Council resolved to abandon the portcullis seal for a design which had appeared on the seal of a document dated 1548, entitled 'Ordinances for the Towne of Swaynsey'. The seal on this document was possibly the Borough Seal of the time, and it was claimed by historians of the early 19th century that the devices depicted on it were the Arms granted to the Borough by William de Breos, Lord of Gower, in 1306. Such claims cannot be supported by documentary evidence, although there is certainly some connection, since the Arms of de Breos appear in the design of the Seal.<br>
These Arms have been blazoned as follows:- '<i>Gules a Castle double-towered Argent, in the gateway a portcullis half-down or; on each tower a banner bearing the Arms of de Breos, viz. Argent a lion rampant crusilly Or. In Chief on a shield or an Osprey rising regardant with a fish, the tail-end in its beak, both proper</i>'.<br>
For some reason, however, this design was not adopted for the Seal of the Corporation following the Committee resolution, although it was displayed on many items of Corporation property, and appears especially on the covers of 19th-century Minute Books and volumes of other Corporation documents. The device, however, was finally adopted as the Common Seal of the Council in November 1922, and, indeed, it still appears on the present Seal of the Council.<br>
The castle represents the mediaeval fortifications of the town and the castle erected by Henry de Beaumont in 1099, around which the town grew up. The blue and white wavy bars represent the sea, since Swansea is a port.<br>
The lion as dexter supporter and on the inescutcheon commemorates the link with the de Breos family, while the dragon as sinister supporter is the National Emblem of Wales and is a supporter in the Achievement of Arms of the present Lord Swansea.</p>

The long bow is in allusion to Brecon's long military tradition, and the hay fork to the position the Town enjoys as the centre of an agricultural area.<br>
The gold eagle stands for St. John the Evangelist, in allusion to the Cathedral Church of St. John the Evangelist, and is differenced by a green and white rounded charged on the wing by an open book. The Dragon of Wales needs no explanation, and is here differenced by a rounded charged with XXIV referring to the XXIV Regiment, South Wales Borderers who on the 11th June, 1948, received the Freedom of the Borough.

The waves and salmon refer to the River Dee and its fisheries, for which Golftyn was the local centre. The green background is a reminder of the hills, woods and natural amenities which form the background to the industrial scene, and also of the green shield with white stag attributed to Cynwrig Fychan, a descendent of the Old Welsh tribal chief Llywarch Holbrwch to whom these arms were assigned by the Tudor Heralds. Cynwrig held "Wepra" and its environs.<br>
The mantling is in the Welsh National colours of green and white. The crest refers to the town's modern industries and its situation in Flintshire. The circlet of steel and the flames refer to the local steelworks and power station. The dragon of Wales is in the same attitude and position as in the crest of the County Council. It holds the distinctive black cross of Edwyn, Lord of Tegeingl, the district which covered the modern Deeside; this cross is the basis of the County arms, and appears in the Device of the Flintshire Technical College at Connah's Quay.</p>

<p>The arms are based on the Borough's original seal showing the Castle and ships signifying Neath�s early development as a significant fortified trading port. Here the ships are black to represent the coal trade with the blue and white waves representing the river below. The flags flying from the ships' masts are green and white, the colours of Wales, and the gold clarion on the sails are from the arms of Richard de Granville, Lord of Neath, Constable of the Castle of Neath and founder of Neath Abbey. The red tower on a green base represents the castle on the river bank.<br>
The tower is a reminder of Neath�s fortifications, coloured black to further emphasise coal, whilst the Roman eagle, with its steel collar, breathes flames, representing the heavy metal industry.The symbol of Mars is generally used to represent metal working.<br> 
The two red dragons are symbols of Wales and their crowns are a link to the Welsh Princes. The one on the left carries the arms of the de Clare family, Lords of Glamorgan, while the one on the right carries the arms of Hugh de Despenser, Lord of Gower. These families granted early charters to the town.<br>
The motto is a quotation from Horace and can be translated as �Thou guardest Neath� with the Romans using the ancient Celtic �Nid� (a river goddess) to make their name for Neath as �Nidum�.</p>

<p>The chevronels are those of Gilbert de Clare, first Earl of Pembroke, while in the border the red martlets on white are from the arms of William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 1251-96, and the gold martlets on blue are from the arms of Jasper Tudor who was created Earl of Pembroke in 1453.<br>
The castle and anchor stand for Pembroke town and dock.<br>
The red lion is derived from the arms of William the Marshal, who was Earl of Pembroke 1199-1219, and was succeeded in the earldom by his five sons. The white lion is from the heraldry of the Herbert family, who have held the Earldom of Pembroke since 1468. The naval crowns refer to Pembroke Dock, with particular reference to the former Royal Naval Dockyard, and the portcullis and rose are badges of King Henry VII, who was born at Pembroke Castle in 1457.<br>
The motto is a variation of that of the Herbert Earls of Pembroke, <i>Ung je serviray</i>.</p>

<p>The division of the shield into red and blue and the white lion is derived from the arms of Herbert - anciently and for a long period Lords of the Manor. The two white eagles are taken from the arms of Blundell, at the time of the grant a member of that family was the Lady of the Manor. The white wavy Chevron charged with a wavy blue Chevronel alludes to the "Weare" or Port.<br>
The anchor refers to the Port and "Seaside" character of Porthcawl supported on either side by a dragon's leg - taken from the Red Dragon of Wales.<br>
The Badge includes the anchor which is the emblem hitherto used by the Council - it is coloured blue in reference to the sea. The escallops, again, are an allusion to the seaside character of the resort whither people make pilgrimage in search of health and recreation.</p>

<p>The blue and gold waves represent the sea and sands, and the grassy mound represents the local uplands. The castle is an heraldically stylized one referring to the strongholds that have indicated the strategic position of Prestatyn from pre-Norman days until the late thirteenth century, under the lordship of the Banastres and Cr�vecoeurs. For many generations Prestatyn and Meliden were held by the Conwy family now represented by Lord Langford. The red rose is a principle emblem in the Conwy arms, and this appears to commemorate the long association of the that family with the town. The rose is also an obvious allusion to the fame of Prestatyn as the �Rose Town of North Wales� and, with two sprigs of oak referring to the abundant woodlands, especially Coed-yr-Esgob and Coed Bell, suggests the natural amenities which are so characteristic of Prestatyn.<br>
The decorative mantling is in the basic colours of the shield, the blue and gold of the sea and sands. The blue circlet with three gold crescents alludes to the rapid growth of this seaside town, and from it rises a derivative of the device formerly used in the Council�s seal � a tree-trunk supported by the Welsh dragon, shown as he appears in the crest of Clwyd.<br>
The motto is from Seneca�s �Epistulae�.</p>

<p>The basic colour of the shield is known as Tenny, derived from the French word Tenn�, meaning a tawny colour, and is a direct reference to one of the possible meanings of the name Rhyl, namely a sandbank, and also to the beaches for which the resort is justly famous. The colour is a very rarely used heraldic tincture and the arms have the unique distinction of being the first civic arms in the British Isles to be granted with a Tenny field. The blue and white pile symbolises the sea and port at Rhyl giving access to the River Clwyd. The word "Clwyd" includes amongst its meanings a moveable hurdle or wattle and the River Clwyd is represented by the wattle extending across the shield. The heraldic ship and the salmon in the shield represent the sailing which was popular at the resort and both the fishing industry and the fishing sport of the resort. The colour red has been used in design as a reference to the Principality of Wales.<br>
Another probable meaning of the word "Rhyl" is "hill" or "hillock" and for this reason a green mound has been incorporated above the wreath and on top of which sits the Red Dragon of Wales holding a banner repeating the arms.</p>

<p>The shield previously appeared for centuries upon the ancient seal above a stylised castle. The upper half is evidently derived from the arms of the de Valence Earls of Pembroke, who built the castle and walls and gave the earliest charters. The lower half of the shield is believed to be based on the arms of the See of St Davids. The de Valence martlets are shown red upon white and blue bars, and the cinguefoils black upon gold, as in the parent arms.<br>
The crest-wreath is in the de Valence colours of blue and white and the crest itself combines the ship and castle from the two sides of the ancient seal. The white fleur de lys on blue refer to St Mary the Virgin, patron Saint of the Parish.<br>
The two heraldic golden dolphins refer to Tenby's descriptive Welsh name "<i>Dinbych-y-Pysgod</i>", and allude not only to the ancient fishing industry but also to the modern importance of Tenby as a seaside resort. They support pennons bearing the white and blue liveries of the House of Lancaster and the white and green of the House of Tudor, in reference to the Charters of Henry IV and Elizabeth I. The roundels derive from the badge of the Round Table which presented the arms to the town. The gold mural crown set over the black and white background suggests the links between the Round Table and the life of the town.<br>
The motto in Greek, over the door of Laston House (the Tenby Bath House), is from Eurpides "Iphigeneia in Tauris".</p>

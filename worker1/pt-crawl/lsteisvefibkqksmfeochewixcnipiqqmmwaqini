<h1>3. With whom do we share your data?</h1>
<p>As a principle, only the staff and personnel of EA have access to your personal data who process your data in compliance with applicable data protection laws. We do our best to keep your data confidential at all times, e.g., by confidentiality agreements entered into with the persons who have access to your data and by training them regarding data protection.</p>
<p>We may also share your data with service providers or other organisations such as host providers, IT/software providers, advisors, lawyers, insurances, newsletter provider and social media platforms who work on behalf of or together with European Athletics under confidentiality agreements and/or so-called data processing agreements.</p>
<p>We may furthermore share your data if we are legally obliged to respond to subpoenas, court orders, claims, legal processes or other legal obligations.</p>
<p>We may share your data also if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, emergency situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of European Athletics ‘s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>We may also share your data with other third parties if you have given your consent to do so, if we are required to do so by legal, regulatory or business obligations, if it is necessary for an association dissolution or a merger with another association or another similar event, or if it is necessary in connection with legal proceedings or to assert or defend claims.</p>
<p>We may also transfer your data to third parties if this is required in the context of analyzing your use of our website and/or to offer customized services to you, as described further above (section 2.2 and 2.5).</p>
<h1>4. Will your data be transferred abroad?</h1>
<p>EA may transfer your data to third parties domiciled abroad in connection to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The countries that your personal data may be shared are the following:</p>

<li>France</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>The Netherlands</li>
<li>Spain</li>

<p>If these third parties are domiciled in a country with a lower level of data protection than Switzerland or the European Union, we use contractual agreements, in particular the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC), or other legal arrangements to make sure that your data is adequately protected. This is the case for the USA.</p>
<h1>5. How long will your data be stored?</h1>
<p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this Privacy Policy, your personal data will remain with us until the contract or other purpose for which the data was collected has been fulfilled, unless applicable statutory retention obligations apply. In general, your personal data is stored for ten years after our last interaction with you.</p>
<p>If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job offer or withdraw your job application, we reserve the right to retain the data you have submitted on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) for up to three months from the end of the application procedure (rejection or withdrawal of the application). Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the physical application documents will be destroyed. The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is evident that the data will be required after the expiry of the three-month period (e.g., due to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only take place when the purpose for further storage no longer applies. In certain cases, we may ask for your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) to store your application data for future job positions at our organisation.</p>
<p>Longer storage may also take place if you have given your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) or if statutory data retention requirements preclude the deletion. This may also occur with regard to pending or potential legal or administrative proceedings. </p>
<p>If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods or pending legal proceedings); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>

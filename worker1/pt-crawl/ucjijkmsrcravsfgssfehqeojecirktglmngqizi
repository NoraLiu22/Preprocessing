<meta name="description" content="Fourteen years later, and after several lawsuits and heated public debates over the future of firefighting in Stamford, many of those attempts were left unfinished -- or undone through court rulings.  To cover a decreasing pool of active volunteers among Stamford's Big Five, the five volunteer-run departments granted autonomy and funding by the city Charter, Malloy's administration looked toward the city department, Stamford Fire &amp; Rescue, to supply the firehouses north of downtown with more manpower.  In a large district in central Stamford, two city engine companies run out of steel garages built after Turn of River went all-volunteer in summer 2008, voting down an agreement with the city over a proposed merger with Stamford Fire &amp; Rescue.  The merger was introduced in 2007 and caused an uproar among volunteer fire officials, who saw it as an attempt to dismantle the volunteer fire system in Stamford, a system protected by the Charter since the city and town of Stamford become a single municipality in the 1940s.  [...] volunteer fire officials said his attempts were unilateral and claimed they violated the city Charter and contracts with the departments.  Paid firefighters at Belltown and Turn of River were assimilated in Stamford Fire &amp; Rescue because they were considered city employees under the same labor contract as city firefighters, leaving the two departments with volunteers only.  The settlement with Belltown leaves one outstanding litigation between the city and a volunteer fire department: the city's lawsuit challenging the legitimacy of the Turn of River fire marshal."/>

	<p>STAMFORD -- Former Mayor <a href="/web/20120127051017/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22Dannel+Malloy%22">Dannel Malloy</a> began his attempts to reform the city's fire service soon after he took office. Fourteen years later, and after several lawsuits and heated public debates over the future of firefighting in Stamford, many of those attempts were left unfinished -- or undone through court rulings.</p>
<p>Still, Malloy says he made Stamford safer.</p>
<p>"We've moved the ball forward substantially," Malloy said Monday, his last day in office.</p>
<p>To cover a decreasing pool of active volunteers among Stamford's Big Five, the five volunteer-run departments granted autonomy and funding by the city Charter, Malloy's administration looked toward the city department, <a href="/web/20120127051017/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22Stamford+Fire+%26+Rescue%22">Stamford Fire &amp; Rescue</a>, to supply the firehouses north of downtown with more manpower.</p>
<p>Two of those departments, Springdale and Glenbrook, saw the addition of a city engine company to its ranks under Malloy's tenure. In a large district in central Stamford, two city engine companies run out of steel garages built after Turn of River went all-volunteer in summer 2008, voting down an agreement with the city over a proposed merger with Stamford Fire &amp; Rescue.</p>
<p>The merger was introduced in 2007 and caused an uproar among volunteer fire officials, who saw it as an attempt to dismantle the volunteer fire system in Stamford, a system protected by the Charter since the city and town of Stamford become a single municipality in the 1940s.</p>
<p>The city -- downtown Stamford and neighborhoods including the West Side, South End and the East Side -- was covered by several firehouses manned by career firefighters from Stamford Fire &amp; Rescue. </p>
<p>North of downtown, Stamford was split into five districts: Belltown, Glenbrook, Springdale, Turn of River and Long Ridge, each with its <a href="/web/20120127051017/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22own+volunteer+fire+department%22">own volunteer fire department</a>, chief and standards.</p>
<p>When the city and town merged in the 1940s, Stamford was split into six independent fire districts, each with its own department. Malloy later sought to consolidate the departments to streamline command and oversee spending. But volunteer fire officials said his attempts were unilateral and claimed they violated the city Charter and contracts with the departments.</p>
<p>When the volunteer departments opposed the merger, the city slashed their budgets and left them only fractions of their original funding. Paid firefighters at Belltown and Turn of River were assimilated in Stamford Fire &amp; Rescue because they were considered city employees under the same labor contract as city firefighters, leaving the two departments with volunteers only.</p>
<p>This fall, the courts ruled in favor of Turn of River and ordered the city to pay back $288,000 in budgeted funds it withheld after the fire department opposed the merger. The funds were used as an incentive to get the department to agree to the merger, and a state <a href="/web/20120127051017/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22Superior+Court%22">Superior Court</a> judge said the city could not use budgeted funds in that manner. </p>
<p>The courts also ruled that the city violated its contract with the Turn of River fire department, but denied its claim for $1.8 million in damages.</p>
<p>Asked whether he would change his approach to reforming the fire service, Malloy said: "I'm sure there are some things we could have done different and, in retrospect, I imagine that some of the language should have been different in the agreement with Turn of River. With that exception, now we need to move forward. I think we have made very substantial progress."</p>
<p>Malloy, however, said it was the volunteer fire officials who refused to compromise over the merger, not him.</p>
<p>"The reality of that is it's always been the volunteers' way or the highway, but I guess it is all based on perception," Malloy said.</p>
<p>Among the city's volunteer fire chiefs, the perception is that Malloy and his director of public safety, <a href="/web/20120127051017/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22William+Callion%22">William Callion</a>, were heavy-handed in their approach to consolidate the fire service.</p>
<p>Callion, who stepped down from his position at midnight Monday, would not comment on the failed merger, saying he did not want to feed any controversy. </p>
<p>"I am just hopeful that a long-term view for the safety of the citizens and the businesses and their homes and business is paramount," Callion said.</p>
<p>Leon Rosenblatt, a West Hartford attorney, represented Long Ridge during a lawsuit against the city in 1998 that was settled in 2004. He also represented the <a href="/web/20120127051017/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22Belltown+Fire+Department%22">Belltown Fire Department</a> during its recent litigation with the city over the proposed merger.</p>
<p>Regarding Malloy's attempts to reform the fire service, Rosenblatt said the dispute was unnecessary.</p>
<p>"Politicians who take the approach, `It's my way or the highway,' generally do not succeed," he said. "It's perfectly obvious that the goals of the administration were to consolidate all the fire companies into the city fire department and eliminate the volunteer companies."</p>
<p>A month before Malloy left office, the city and Belltown struck a deal. They settled the lawsuit over the merger in November. Belltown Chief <a href="/web/20120127051017/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22John+Didelot%22">John Didelot</a> said he and Callion agreed on terms after the Turn of River's lawsuits were decided. </p>
<p>Under the terms, Belltown gets $9,000 a month until this summer and a $25,000 lump sum payment to replace aging firefighter equipment. </p>
<p>"We really hope the new administration will sit down and talk to us," Didelot said. "No one is unwilling to work with anyone. We were always willing to work with any administration, but we were just shut out."</p>
<p>The settlement with Belltown leaves one outstanding litigation between the city and a volunteer fire department: the city's lawsuit challenging the legitimacy of the Turn of River fire marshal. Whether the department gets back its paid employees is up to the new mayor's administration.</p>

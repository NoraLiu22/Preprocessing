      <p>Since the first members banded together in 1895 to save
Connecticut's forest from runaway fires and excessive timber
harvesting, the association's singular blend of vision and persistence
has protected the landscapes whose very names mean Connecticut. Peoples
State Forest. Mohawk State Forest. Gillette Castle. Rocky Neck.
Sherwood Island. Talcott Mountain.</p>
      <p>Over the past century, CFPA has been instrumental in the
acquisition of more than 100 state parks and forest for public use and
enjoyment. Today, CFPA continues to champion the needs of these public
recreational facilities to assure that agencies responsible for their
stewardship receive the funding, personnel and equipment necessary to
maintain these natural treasures.</p>
      <p>CFPA's leadership over the years set a national example for
successful forest conservation and reversed the damage to Connecticut's
natural resources. When the organization began its work, Connecticut
was 20% forested: today it is 60% forested. CFPA maintains a vigilant
role in the sound management and protection of our land, water and
wildlife resources.</p>
      <p>In addition, CFPA's visionary leaders established the
Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail System in 1929 which traverses public and
private lands throughout Connecticut and is enjoyed by thousands of
citizens each year. The 700 miles of trails are maintained by hundreds
of CFPA volunteers working in cooperation with many public and private
landowners.</p>
      <p>But the work is never done; there are constant challenges.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Our public parks require renewed attention and protection.</li>
        <li>The Blue-Blazed Trails require constant monitoring and
maintenance.</li>
        <li>Much of Connecticut's forest land is held in private
ownership, in need of sound management and subject to competing
pressures for other uses.</li>
        <li>Additional open space lands need to be set aside to benefit
future generations and maintain the high quality of life residents have
come to enjoy in Connecticut.</li>
        <li>The environmental health of urban areas likewise deserves
attention.<br>
        </li>

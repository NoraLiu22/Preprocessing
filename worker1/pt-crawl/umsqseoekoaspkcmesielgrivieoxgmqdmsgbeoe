<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><b>1997 COUP D'ETAT</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">On 25 May 1997, the government
of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who had been elected president in March
1996 in the first multi-party elections for nearly three decades in Sierra
Leone, was overthrown by a group of soldiers from the Sierra Leone Army
(SLA) who had formed the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). The
leader of the coup and head of the newly formed AFRC, Johnny Paul Koroma,
had been among nine soldiers charged with attempting to overthrow the government
in September 1996. The armed forces were joined by the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) and formed what became known as the People's Army. In
effect, AFRC soldiers (formerly SLA soldiers) and rebel RUF soldiers jointly
ruled Sierra Leone until February 1998 when ECOMOG (Economic Community
of West African States Monitoring Group) troops stormed Freetown and returned
President Kabbah to power. The RUF and AFRC, including members of the SLA,
retreated to the country side (UK, Apr. 2000, 5; HRW, July 1998, 4; UN
OCHA-IRIN, 29 Dec. 2000).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><b>MAY 1997 - DECEMBER
1999</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The nine months of AFRC/RUF
rule of Sierra Leone, from 25 May 1997 to 13 February 1998, was characterized
by serious human rights violations and a complete breakdown of the rule
of law. Immediately after the 1997 coup, Nigerian ECOMOG forces already
present in Sierra Leone were significantly reinforced by additional troops
from Nigeria, Guinea and Ghana. On 13 February 1998, ECOMOG forces ousted
the AFRC/RUF junta. There were reports of acts of violence and intimidation
by ECOMOG troops against civilians in Freetown and other parts of the country
(UN OCHA-IRIN, 29 Dec. 2000; UK, Apr. 2000, 5 &amp; 9; HRW, July 1998,
4).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">On 19 October 1998, twenty-four
(24) army officers were executed by firing squad after having been convicted
of participation in the 1997 coup d'etat. Ten (10) officers convicted of
the same charges had their sentences commuted to life in prison. The executions
were condemned by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the British
government, the European Union (EU) and UN Secretary-General Koffi Annan
(AFP, 23 Oct. 1998; AFP, 20 Oct. 1998; AI, 20 Oct. 1998; Roy-Macauley,
19 Oct. 1998; HRW, 19 Oct. 1998).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In January 1999 RUF rebels
and some former troops of the SLA launched an assault on Freetown and seized
parts of the city from ECOMOG. Before ECOMOG regained control of the capital,
at least 5,000 people were killed and many neighborhoods were demolished.
Thousands of others were abducted by the rebel forces. Some were used for
forced labor, others as sex slaves, and many terrorized into joining the
rebel army. ECOMOG forces summarily executed suspected rebels and collaborators
in their efforts to drive the rebel forces from the city (UN OCHA-IRIN,
29 Dec. 2000; UK, Apr. 2000, 8).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">All parties to the conflict
were responsible for human rights abuses and violations of international
humanitarian law. Civilian Defense Forces (CDFs) and civilian militias,
commonly referred to as <i>Kamajors</i>, who support the Kabbah government,
committed various human rights abuses including indiscriminate killings
and torture. The <i>Kamajors </i>were responsible for the majority of abuses
committed by those fighting on behalf of the Kabbah government since February
1998. However, abuses by forces aligned with the Kabbah government were
carried out on a smaller scale than those abuses committed by the AFRC/RUF
(HRW, July 1998, 4-5).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The AFRC/RUF waged war by
attacking the civilian population. They used a brutal terror campaign to
exert political and military control over the population. Testimony taken
from survivors and witnesses of rebel attacks reported physical mutilation,
rape, abduction, torture and murder among the atrocities committed by the
AFRC/RUF (HRW, July 1998, 11).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In an attempt to restore
peace and stability to the country, the United Nations Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNAMSIL) was deployed in November 1999 to assist in the implementation
of the Lome Peace Accord signed by the Kabbah government and RUF rebels
in July 1999. The accord provided for the establishment of a unity government
that includes the RUF and former AFRC junta. UNAMSIL has been criticized
as being ineffective in its ability to protect civilians from harm in rebel-controlled
territory (HRW, 30 Nov. 2000; Adeyemi, 15 Nov. 2000).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In February 2000 UNAMSIL
was expanded in size from 6,000 to 11,000. During the following month rebels
attacked UN forces in eastern Sierra Leone and seized weapons and equipment.
In May more than 500 UN peacekeepers were abducted by the RUF. The previous
peace deal reached between the Sierra Leonean government and the RUF rebels
collapsed and British troops arrived to evacuate British nationals. British
advisors provided support for the UN forces (Reuters, 3 Jan. 2001; UN OCHA-IRIN,
29 Dec. 2000).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Complicating matters further,
the Indian commander of UNAMSIL accused Nigerian peacekeepers of sabotaging
the peace process by colluding with rebels in illegal diamond mining. In
August 2000 former SLA soldiers held several UN officials, ECOMOG troops,
journalists, and others hostage. Most were released within a week and RUF
commanders being held were also freed a month later. In September British
paratroopers attacked the camp of a rebel group known as the West Side
boys who had taken 11 British troops hostage. During the same month India
and Jordan withdrew their troop support from UNAMSIL. British troops deployed
a taskforce of 500 British Royal Marines in Freetown to reinforce their
troops who were training the SLA (Reuters, 3 Jan. 01; UN OCHA-IRIN, 29
Dec. 2000; Adeyemi, 15 Nov. 2000).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><b>CURRENT SITUATION</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">On 10 November 2000, the
RUF and the government of President Kabbah signed a nine-point peace agreement
in Abuja, Nigeria. The agreement called for an immediate 30-day cease-fire,
full deployment of UNAMSIL, and the return of equipment, weapons and ammunitions
seized by the RUF. The agreement also called for the immediate resumption
of the disarmament, demobilization and integration program of the Lome
Peace Accord signed in July 1999. In December Britain announced that 300
Gurkha soldiers will help train the SLA (UNOCHA-IRIN, 29 Dec. 2000; Adeyemi,
15 Nov. 2000).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Presently, UNAMSIL reports
that general security in the country remains calm, except for areas near
the southeastern Guinea border. Agence France Presse reported the Sierra
Leone government's mounting concern over RUF rebel activity in Guinea that
has claimed at least 900 lives and caused the displacement of hundreds
of thousands of local Guineans and Sierra Leoneans and Liberians who resided
in Guinea as refugees. Sierra Leonean refugees continue arriving in the
Guinean capital of Conakry after fleeing the conflict zones of southwestern
Guinea. Many of those in Conakry are awaiting sea passage to Freetown.
UNHCR stated that as of December 30<sup>th</sup> 1,559 refugees had voluntarily
repatriated to Sierra Leone in an effort to flee the rebel violence that
has now spread to southern Guinea. Meanwhile in Freetown, returnees have
refused to move out of refugee transit centers after the maximum 5-day
stay. UNHCR is trying to arrange alternate accommodations in Sierra Leone
for those from unsafe areas of the country (UNHCR, 2 Jan. 2001; AFP, 27
Dec. 2000; UN-OCHA, 22 Dec. 2000).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">UNAMSIL peacekeepers, whose
mandate has been extended until 31 March 2001, appear to now be poised
to enter RUF controlled territory. However, at the moment RUF intentions
remain unclear. Although the RUF appears to have attempted to put a stop
to atrocities being committed by its forces and has allowed further freedom
of movement within Sierra Leone, the RUF has sent mixed signals regarding
UNAMSIL deployment in accord with the peace agreement. The RUF has indicated
that the UN forces could only deploy if RUF leader, Foday Sankoh, is freed;
and at other times the RUF has stated that Sankoh's release was not a requisite
for UNAMSIL deployment in territory under its control. The U.S. government
has extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to certain Sierra Leonean
nationals until 2 November 2001 (Reuters, 3 Jan. 2001; UNSC, 22 Dec. 2000;
FR, 9 Nov. 2000).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>

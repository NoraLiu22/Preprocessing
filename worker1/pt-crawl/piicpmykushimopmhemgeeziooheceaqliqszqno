      section, CAPT Edward L. Beach, USN (ret.) was erroneously listed as having
      been the XO of USS <i> Tang</i> (SS-306). CAPT Beach served as the XO of USS

    December 1999 Rear Admiral J.B. Hinkle (COMNAVPERSCOM) established the
    &quot;Pickle&quot; award to recognize those command personnel who &quot;go
    the extra mile&quot; to provide exceptional customer service. The award is
    based on the philosophy of &quot;Give 'Em the Pickleï¿½and they'll be
    back&quot; advocated by Mr. Robert Farrell, a successful businessman and
    creator of Farrell's Ice Cream Parlors. Mr. Farrell tells a story of a
    business that lost a customer because they wouldn't serve him a pickle with
    his sandwich. He uses the pickle analogy to show that organizations can
    exceed their customer's expectations by going the extra mile for their
    business. The &quot;Pickle&quot; award consists of a &quot;Give 'Em the
    Pickle&quot; mug imprinted with the NAVPERSCOM logo. Above, Admiral Hinkle
    awards LCDR Michael Holland (PERS 421A - Department Head Detailer) the
    &quot;Pickle Award&quot; for March 2000. LCDR Holland has been the Submarine
    Department Head Detailer for nearly two years. He was recognized for his
    outstanding contributions to Junior Officer retention using every detailing
    avenue in efforts to help officers stay Navy while serving their personal
    and professional needs.</font></p>

      the Continental Navy readied in the Delaware </font><font size="2" face="Arial">
      River, Commodore
      </font><font size="2" face="Arial"> Esek Hopkins
      issued a set of fleet signals. Among these signals was an instruction
      directing</font><font size="2" face="Arial"> his vessels to fly a striped Jack and
      Ensi</font><font size="2" face="Arial">gn at their proper
      places. The custom of the jack-type flag had originated with the Royal
      Navy in the 15th century or earlier; such was the likely source of
      Hopkins' inspiration. This first U.S. Navy Jack has traditionally been
      shown as consisting of 13 horizontal alternating red and white stripes
      with a superimposed rattlesnake and the motto &quot;Don't Tread on
      Me.&quot; The rattlesnake had long been a symbol of resistance to British
      repressive acts in Colonial America; its display on the new jack of the
      fledging Continental Navy fit naturally with the fervor of the
      times.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to Dr. Whitney Smith of the Flag
      Research Center, the traditional design of the First Navy Jack has never
      been accurately determined. Historians inferred the design from Hopkins's
      message and a color plate depicting a slightly different &quot;Don't Tread
      Upon Me&quot; flag used as a Navy Ensign in Admiral George Henry Preble's
      1880 book, <i> History of the Flag of the United States</i>. Historians' widely
      copied Preble's rare color plate, thus providing the probable source of
      the traditional design of the First Navy Jack.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first U.S. Navy use of the Union Jack
      (a flag replicating the canton i.e. white stars on a blue field of the
      U.S. Flag) probably occurred soon after the adoption of the First Stars
      and Stripes Law on June 14, 1777. The First Stars and Stripes Law stated
      that the Flag of the United States be 13 stripes alternating red and white
      and that the union be 13 white stars in a blue field representing a new
      constellation. Although the date of introduction of the Union Jack is not
      precisely known, a 1785 engraving of the frigate USS <i> Philadelphia</i> clearly
      depicts the Union Jack flying from her jackstaff.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;As the number of states increased,
      the Union Jack was altered to conform to the canton of the national flag.
      General orders were issued from time to time by the Navy Department when a
      change in the number of stars was necessary.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Navy Regulations, first promulgated in
      1865, prescribed the use of the jack. It is displayed daily from the
      jackstaff of all U.S. naval vessels in commission, from 8 a.m. to sunset
      while the ship is at anchor. Additionally it is flown to indicate a court
      martial is in progress, and as the President's and Secretary of the Navy's
      personal flag.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There have been two instances were the
      traditional First Navy Jack has been used in lieu of the Union Jack. In
      1975, the Secretary of the Navy directed that the First Navy Jack be flown
      in lieu of the Union Jack during the United States Bicentennial Year as a
      colorful and historic reminder of the nation's and the Navy's origin. In
      1980, the Secretary of the Navy specified that the ship with the longest
      total period of active service display the First Navy Jack until
      decommissioned or transferred to inactive service, at which time the flag
      shall be passed to the next ship in line with appropriate honors. Since
      1998, the USS <i> Kitty Hawk</i> (CV-63) has proudly flown the First Navy
      Jack.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On June 3, 1999, the Secretary of the Navy
      authorized submarines and submarine tenders to fly a special Submarine
      Centennial Jack throughout the year 2000 in honor of the U. S. Submarine
      Force's Centennial. This marks the first occasion since 1775 that a
      specific class of ships has been so honored.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              history of sports on U.S. television is the history of sports on<i> 
              network </i>television. Indeed, that history is closely related 
              to the development and success of the major television networks. 
              "Television got off the ground because of sports," reminisced pioneering 
              television sports director Harry Coyle. He coninued, "Today, maybe, 
              sports need television to survive, but it was just the opposite 
              when it first started. When we (NBC) put on the World Series in 
              1947, heavyweight fights, the Army-Navy football game, the sales 
              of television sets just spurted." </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
              only 190,000 sets in use in 1948, the attraction of sports to the 
              networks in its early period was not advertising dollars. Instead, 
              broadcasters were looking toward the future of the medium, and aired 
              sports as a means of boosting demand for television as a medium. 
              They believed their strategy would eventually pay off in advertising 
              revenues. But because NBC, CBS and DuMont manufactured and sold 
              receiver sets, their more immediate goal was to sell more of them. 
              Sports did indeed draw viewers, and although the stunning acceptance 
              and diffusion of television cannot be attributed solely to sports, 
              the number of sets in use in the U.S. reached ten and a half million 
              by 1950.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Technical and economic factors made sports attractive to the fledging 
              medium. Early television cameras were heavy and cumbersome and needed 
              bright light to produce even a passable picture. Boxing and wrestling, 
              contested in confined, very well-lit arenas and baseball and football, 
              well-lit by the sun and played out in a familiar, well-defined spaces, 
              were perfect subjects for the lens. Equally important, because sporting 
              events already existed there were no sets to build, no writers and 
              actors to hire. This made sports inexpensive to produce, a primary 
              concern when the audience was small and not yet generating large 
              advertising revenues. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              first televised sporting event was a college baseball game between 
              Columbia and Princeton in 1939, covered by one camera providing 
              a point of view along the third base line. But the first network 
              sports broadcast was NBC's <i>Gillette Cavalcade of Sports</i>, 
              which premiered in 1944 with the Willie Pep vs. Chalky White Featherweight 
              Championship bout. Sports soon became a fixture on prime-time network 
              programming, often accounting for one third of the networks' total 
              evening fare. But in the 1950s, as television's other genres matured 
              and developed their own large and loyal (and approximately 50% female) 
              followings, sports began to disappear from network prime-time, settling 
              into a very profitable and successful niche on weekends. This, too, 
              would change, like so much else in television, with alterations 
              in the technology and economics of the medium. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Gillette 
              Cavalcade of Sports</i> stayed on the network air for 20 years, 
              a prime example of sporting events presented by a single sponsor. 
              By the mid-1960s, however, televised sports had become so expensive 
              that individual advertisers found it increasingly difficult to pay 
              for sponsorship of major events by themselves. Still, the number 
              of hours of sports on network television exploded as the audience 
              grew and the multiplying ranks of spot-buying advertisers coveted 
              these valuable minutes. This mutually beneficial situation persisted 
              until well into the 1980s when the historically increasing amounts 
              of advertising dollars began to decline, and networks experienced 
              diminishing profit margins on sports. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
              the economics of televised sports had begun to unravel earlier. 
              In 1970, for example, the networks paid $50 million to broadcast 
              the National Football League (NFL), $2 million for the National 
              Basketball Association (NBA) and $18 million for major league baseball. 
              In 1985 those figures had risen to $450 million, $45 million and 
              $160 million respectively. These large increases were fueled by 
              growing public interest in professional sports, in part as a result 
              of more and better television coverage. But equally important, the 
              networks saw the broadcasting of big time sports as the hallmark 
              of institutional supremacy in broadcasting. Major league sports 
              meant major league broadcasting--not an unimportant issue for the 
              networks now challenged by VCR, the newly empowered independent 
              stations, and cable. Many of these cable channels were themselves 
              carrying sports (WGN, WTBS, and HBO, for example), and one, ESPN, 
              offered nothing but sports. Seemingly unconcerned, the CBS, NBC, 
              and ABC attitude could be described as "Who cares about Australian 
              Rules Football?" (a high point of early ESPN programming). </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
              rising fees for rights to major sporting events were not, in themselves, 
              bad for the networks. They could afford them, and the cable and 
              independent channels could not. But increasing rights fees, accompanied 
              by falling ratings, proved to be disastrous. From 1980 to 1984, 
              broadcasts of professional football lost 7% of their viewership 
              (12% among men 18 to 34 years old) and baseball lost 26% of its 
              viewers, showing a 63% decline among young males. Non-sports programming 
              on cable, home video use, and the independents took many of these 
              viewers. In addition, sports on the competing channels further diluted 
              the remaining sports audience. To make up for falling revenues on 
              all its programming as they began to lose audience, the networks 
              began to raise the price of advertising time on sports shows to 
              cover the huge rights fees contractually owed to the sports leagues. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Advertisers 
              balked. Not only were they unwilling to pay higher prices for smaller 
              audiences, but the once attractive male audience was becoming less 
              desirable as working women came to control even larger amounts of 
              consumer capital. Rather than pay what they saw as inflated rates 
              for a smaller and now less prized set of viewers, many advertisers 
              bought commercial time away from sports altogether, feeling they 
              could reach their target audiences more efficiently through other 
              types of shows. Car manufacturers turned to prime-time drama to 
              reach women, who were increasingly making car-buying decisions; 
              beer makers were turning to MTV to get young women and young men. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, 
              in order to make the most of their expensive contracts with the 
              major sports leagues, the networks began broadcasting more sports. 
              But spots on sports shows would have been easier to sell had there 
              been fewer of them on the market. The three networks together showed 
              1,500 hours of sports in 1985, double what they programmed in 1960. 
              With about 8 minutes of commercials an hour, the addition of even 
              relatively few hours of programming had a noticeable effect on the 
              supply-and-demand balance of the commercial spot market.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              It was during this same period that superstations WTBS and WGN, 
              and premium channel HBO began national, cable-fed sports programming. 
              ESPN was launched in 1979 and by mid-1980 reached 4 million homes. 
              By 1986, 37 million households subscribed. The glut of sports on 
              television was abetted even more by crucial courts decisions affecting 
              intercollegiat competition. Universities, desirous of their own 
              access to broadcast riches, successfully challenged the National 
              Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and, at times their own regional 
              athletic conferences, to be free of what they considered restrictive 
              television contracts and broadcast revenue-sharing agreements. College 
              basketball and football, once local or regional in appeal, began 
              appearing on the television dial in a complex array of syndication 
              packages and school-centered or conference-centered television networks.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              While the history of televised sports may have been directly related 
              to network television, the current and future states of the genre 
              certainly are not. There are more televised sports today than ever 
              before and they continue to draw a large total audience, but it 
              is an audience fragmented among many available choices. Sports on 
              television, then, is decreasingly likely to originate on a national 
              network. Despite the Super Bowl's annually growing audience and 
              increases in the price of a 30 second spot ($1.3 million for some 
              aired during the 1995 San Francisco/San Diego mismatch), it remains 
              a television anomaly, unique as a television and cultural event. 
              Ratings for individual television sports programs generally continue 
              to decline in the 1990s. The 1993 World Series, for example, had 
              a cumulative rating for all its games of slightly more than 16, 
              surpassing only the 1989 Series interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake. 
              Game 1 of the 1993 contest between Toronto and Atlanta was the lowest 
              rated World Series game ever recorded by Nielsen. When CBS's four 
              year, $1.06 billion deal with major league baseball ended with that 
              Series, the best network deal that the leagues could make was an 
              arrangement with both ABC and NBC tying baseball's income to the 
              amount of advertising sold. Baseball was forced into the business 
              of selling advertising time for the networks (and therefore, for 
              itself). Hockey's ratings on its ABC and ESPN/ESPN2 telecasts, never 
              big, also declined, from 0.9 in 1992 to 0.8 in 1993. The pattern 
              is the same for football, basketball and the Olympics.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              <b>The Industrial Benefits of Televised Sports</b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              This does not mean, however, that viewers no longer watch sports 
              on television. But they have ceased to watch the big marquee events 
              in numbers as great as they once did. Now cable channels and local 
              independent stations have joined the networks as primary outlets 
              for sports programming, and sports remains valuable and attractive 
              to programmers for several distinct reasons </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Except 
              for the big ticket events like the NCAA Basketball Championships, 
              the Super Bowl, the World Series, the National Basketball Association 
              (NBA) Championships and the major college football bowl games, televised 
              sports generally produce smaller audiences than prime-time network 
              programming. Of course, for independents and cable channels sports 
              contests may often draw their biggest viewership. But regardless 
              of the size of the audience for a sports telecast, it is audience 
              composition that is important--this is the demographically attractive 
              audience for advertisers who want to reach males, 18 to 49 years 
              old. Certain sports also bring with them even more narrowly defined 
              audience segments. The products advertised during a bowling match, 
              a game of golf or an auto race, make it immediately clear that a 
              particular demographic group is being targeted. And advertising 
              rates for these events are usually well below those charged on more 
              general-interest programming. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
              the new technologies began to divide the television audience, huge 
              rights fees to big sports leagues became a burden for the networks. 
              But for cable channels, local broadcasters and even for certain 
              events on the networks, sports are often cheaper to buy and air 
              than much first-run programming. This is why many regional sports 
              networks such as the Boston Red Sox Baseball Network have developed. 
              This is why team- and conference-centered ad hoc networks (groups 
              of stations that come together in a network for specific programming 
              like the Pac-10 Football Network or the Big East Game of the Week) 
              have grown in number. And this is why ballgames or boxing matches 
              are programmed on cable channels such as HBO, WTBS, WGN, and TNT. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sports 
              is the only programming that has successfully attracted large audiences 
              on a weekend day. This creation of regularized audience behavior 
              enables the medium to maintain its role as a familiar aspect of 
              "everyday life." </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sports 
              also link the medium into a system of cross-promotion. Newspapers, 
              radio stations, even stations in competition with a channel airing 
              the weekend's big game all provide free advertising in the course 
              of their usual sports coverage. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ultimately, 
              the reason sports are popular with broadcasters is that they are 
              popular with viewers. Even the 1993 "low rated" World Series drew 
              an average of fourteen and a half million households a game. The 
              National Hockey League's (NHL) tiny 0.8 rating per game translates 
              into three quarters of a million homes. And, as FOX Television's 
              1994 acquisition of the pro football rights from CBS makes clear, 
              the networks still see the ownership of the rights to major league 
              sports as tantamount to being in the Big Time. Owner Rupert Murdoch 
              dismissed the $350 million loss for FOX Television in its first 
              year of NFL broadcasts as "an investment" in altering audience perceptions 
              of his low-rated fourth network.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              <b>The Appeals of Televised Sports </b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
              why are these contests of skill, originally designed to test the 
              abilities of the participants and then to delight those who attend, 
              so popular from a distance, on an illuminated iridescent screen? 
              A range of possible appeals may be involved in gathering the large 
              audiences for sporting events. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Viewers 
              identify with their team, their favorite players, those warriors 
              who carry the good name of their city, college, conference, nation, 
              ethnic heritage, or other characteristic, into battle. Sports offer 
              real heroes and villains, as opposed to the fictional characters 
              of televised drama and comedy. Fans become familiar with those real 
              individuals and their teams, following them, learning about them, 
              living and dying with them, or, in the immortal words of <i>ABC 
              Wide World of Sports</i>, experiencing with them the "joy of victory 
              and the agony of defeat." </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sports 
              on television is live television, it is history in the making, it 
              is being "up close and personal" (again, thanks to ABC) as possibly 
              momentous events unfold. To thrill in the victory of a favorite, 
              to join the excitment of the moment in an exhilarating game or to 
              learn more about the teams, players or games on television are among 
              possible satisfactions that are obviously specific to sports on 
              television. </font></p>

              Aesthetics of Televised Sports </b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
              no doubt a fourth reason why people watch televised sports is that 
              they often make great television. Carlton Fisk's famous 1975 World 
              Series homer, the American hockey victory over the Soviet Union 
              team at the Lake Placid Olympics and the camera's sad attention 
              to Thurman Thomas in the last quarter of the 1994 Super Bowl, its 
              focus on the individual miscues that had led to a fourth straight 
              Buffalo Bills defeat, are only three examples of the wonder that 
              can be sports on television. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
              what, specifically, makes an individual sporting event "good television?" 
              As <i>Channels</i> writer Julie Talen wrote, "All sports are not 
              created equal. The most popular sports on TV are those best served 
              by the medium's limitations." What she means is that even if there 
              are 20 cameras and 40 microphones at an event, the viewer still 
              receives one picture and one set of sounds. Together these must 
              convey a sense of what is happening in the actual contest. <i>Monday 
              Night Football'</i>s long-time director, Chet Forte, argued, "It's 
              impossible to blow a football game. . .Football works as a flattened 
              sport. Its rectangular field fits on the screen far more readily 
              than, for example, golf's far-flung woods and sand traps. The football 
              moves right or left on the screen and back again. Its limited repertoire--kick, 
              pass, and run--sets it apart from, say, baseball, where the range 
              of possibilities for the ball and the players at any given moment 
              is enormous." And CBS's top football director, Sandy Grossman, says 
              "The reason (the gridiron) is easier to cover is because every play 
              is a separate story. There's a beginning, a middle, and an end, 
              and then there's 20 or 30 seconds to retell it or react to it." 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
              are, in other words, certain characteristics of the different sports 
              that make them better dramatic and visual matches for television, 
              and in doing so, render them more popular with audiences. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              camera, and therefore the fans' attention, is repeatedly redirected 
              to a specific starting point for each new play, serve, or pitch. 
              This is what CBS's Grossman above called a "separate story." Therefore, 
              football and baseball are better than hockey and soccer in providing 
              a discrete starting point.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Tension can be sustained and viewer interest maintained if something 
              crucial can occur at any moment. Any pitch can result in a home 
              run or a fine running catch by the center fielder. Any pass can 
              produce a touchdown or an interception. In contrast, the first three 
              quarters of a basketball game usually serve only to set up the last 
              three minutes and much of soccer's action happens at mid-field, 
              yards and yards away from the goal (and a potential exciting save 
              or game-changing score). </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baseball 
              has innings, football has time-outs and quarters. Those covering 
              and those watching the event can establish a rhythm that allows 
              for the more-or-less natural insertion of commercials and visits 
              to the refrigerator. Soccer has continuous action, as does hockey, 
              which makes commercial insertion more complex. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cameras 
              and viewers have to be able to follow the object of interest on 
              the field and on the small screen, respectively. Basketballs and 
              footballs are big while hockey pucks and golf balls are quite small. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Television 
              is a visual medium; it lives by the pictures it offers its viewers. 
              Baseball and football offer spectacle--big, full, beautiful stadiums, 
              lovely playing surfaces, the blimp, cheerleaders (football) and 
              the bullpen (baseball). Golf presents the manicured scenery of country 
              club settings and the occasional glimpse at windswept Scottish headlands. 
              Tennis, by contrast, has a small rectangular court and bowling has 
              a skinny lane of wood (though each has the beginning-middle-end 
              story structure so desireable to directors). </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nothing 
              adds to visual variety like physical action, people moving and competing. 
              Basketball is ballet above the rim. In football there are incredible 
              tests of strength and aggression. Tennis demands action defined 
              by precision and endurance.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Fans follow players as well as teams and the camera is well versed 
              in the close-up. Roone Arledge of ABC called this "sports as soap 
              opera." Baseball gives us the tight shot of the pitcher's anxiety 
              as he holds the runners on first and third or zooms in on the concentration 
              in the basketball player's eyes as she shoots two from the charity 
              stripe with the game on the line. In hockey it's much more difficult 
              to provide close-up, personal video images because the players wear 
              helmets and skate at 30 miles an hour, but fans can still be attached 
              to individual personalities, waiting for the grudge-induced fistfight 
              on the ice. And as the celebrity status of Arnold Palmer or Jack 
              Nicklaus, or the glamorous intensity of a John McEnroe, a Martina 
              Navratilova, or a Jimmy Conners attest, even the more sedate sports 
              create a cult-like status for their superstars. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
              course, television prefers sports with wide interest because it 
              assures more viewers and ad revenue; but this is a plus for sports 
              fans as well. Surely many fans watch games between teams they would 
              not typically follow. The outcome might affect their home-town favorites 
              or they want to see that scrappy second baseman they've read so 
              much about? </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Televised 
              Sports and "Real World" Sports</b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Fans may watch televised sports for many of these reasons, but this 
              involvment is not without its costs. Here the difference between 
              sports and television's other forms of programming becomes clearer. 
              That is, unlike soap operas and situation comedies, sports exist 
              apart from television. Major league baseball, for example, was born 
              before radio was invented and developed its rules, traditions, nature 
              and character apart from television. Moreover, sports are played 
              in front of and for paying customers. This produces two important 
              tensions. First, what have sports lost and gained from their wedding 
              to television? Second, what have fans lost and gained?</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              The gains might be obvious. The leagues and athletes have prospered. 
              More and more teams and tournaments are played in more and more 
              cities and fill more and more television screens. Television has 
              helped create tremendous interest and excitement for the public, 
              turning the Super Bowl, for example, into something akin to a national 
              celebration.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              The losses, however, might be less obvious. Trying to explain dips 
              in television ratings and attendance at games in the 1993 NFL season, 
              for example, sports reporter Bud Geracie of the San Jose <i>Mercury 
              News</i> wrote, "Terry Bradshaw (former NFL quarterback and Hall 
              of Fame inductee) says that although Dallas is 'as good as any team 
              that's ever played, the league as a whole isn't fun to watch.' Is 
              this a temporary lull in the action, or a permanent condition? Is 
              this (1993) NFL season the product of fluky misfortunes, or is it 
              the beast born of parity...The NFL wanted parity--and took measures 
              to achieve it--and you can't argue with the logic or the success 
              of the concept. The NFL wished to maximize the number of teams in 
              play-off contention late in the season, thereby maximizing fan interest, 
              TV ratings, revenues and the rest. This is what the NFL bosses sought, 
              and this is what they got. What they seem to have lost in the process 
              is the big game. 'There are no big games between 5-4 teams vying 
              for wildcard spots,' said Bob Costas of NBC." </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Television 
              has also been instrumental in changing sports in other not-so-obvious 
              ways, for example in the alteration, even the destruction, of traditional 
              college sports conferences. In February 1994 four schools, The University 
              of Texas, Texas A and M, Texas Tech and Baylor, left the 80 year 
              old Southwest Conference to join another regional conference, the 
              Big Eight. One goal was to cash in on ABC's promise to pay the newly 
              expanded league between $85 million and $90 million for the next 
              five years, with the promise of an additional $10 million if this 
              new football "super-conference" developed a play-off. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other 
              schools in the former Southwestern Conference were left behind. 
              Bubba Thornton, alumnus and track coach of one of the jilted schools, 
              Texas Christian University, lamented in a <i>Sports Illustrated</i> 
              interview, "What the Southwest Conference was about was small towns 
              and big cities, Texans against Texans, wives and girlfriends dressing 
              up, bragging rights, the Methodist preacher talking Sunday morning 
              about beating the Christians [Church of Christ], all the things 
              that keep you going. We were about tradition all these years instead 
              of instant gratification and egos. This decision will come back 
              to haunt us." </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such 
              a view might be attributed to no more than nostalgia, a common aspect 
              of sports in any medium. And certainly different critics' lists 
              might vary. But here are several other "concessions" that fans and 
              the games themselves have made to television: 1) games moved to 
              awkward times of day to satisfy television schedules, ignoring fans 
              who've bought tickets; 2) giant video screens in arenas and stadiums; 
              3) alteration of game rules, as in the creation of the "TV time-out" 
              for television commercials; 4) free agency for players and consequent 
              moves to the "highest bidder;" 5) pro teams moving to better "markets;" 
              6) wild-card games designed to increase playoff partipants; 7) expanded 
              playoffs; 8) the 40-second shot clock in the NFL; 9) the designated 
              hitter in the American League; 10) over-expansion in the professional 
              leagues; 11) salary caps; 12) umpire and officials strikes; 13) 
              recruiting abuses as college teams chase television riches; 14) 
              the playing of World Series games at night in freezing October weather 
              (Game 7 of the 1994 Series was scheduled for October 30); 15) electric 
              lights in Wrigley Field. And 16) players strikes and lock-outs. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              1994 World Series fell victim to baseball's labor problems, but 
              at the root of the dispute that also killed the last half of that 
              season was the inability of the sports' owners to resolve "revenue 
              disparities" between the small and large television market teams.</font> 
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1994-95 National 
              Hockey League season lost nearly half its contests as well as its 
              All Star Game to precisely the same dispute among its franchise 
              owners. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still, 
              the future of sports on television is certainly one that promises 
              more contests on the screen and more transformation of both the 
              games and the medium. It's widely accepted, for example, that one 
              reasons the networks paid such large rights fees to the professional 
              sports leagues throughout the 1980s was to keep them out of the 
              hands of pay-per-view television programmers. In the short term 
              the strategy was successful. But virtually every cable system in 
              America offers at least boxing on a pay basis and the Sports Channel 
              is, for all intents and purposes, pay television. What will happen 
              to competitiveness, franchise stability, and scheduling as individual 
              teams become star attractions? What will happen to the look of the 
              broadcasts and the nature of the games if television "tickets" rather 
              than advertising become the basis of program support? What will 
              changes in the economics of the sports-television marriage mean 
              to the teams, the medium and to the fans? What technological innovations 
              (in covering the games and in distributing them) will we see and 
              what might be their impact? </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Answers 
              to these questions are neither immediate nor obvious. But as a sports 
              reporter might put it, "one thing is certain"--sports will continue 
              to be closely intertwined with devleopments in television. Major 
              events will continue to serve as national rituals. And audiences 
              will continue to follow favorite teams and celebrity players, watching 
              from a distance as the skills, the strength, the speed, and the 
              tactics of athletes, coaches, and owners are pitted against one 
              another on the screen in the home. </font></p>

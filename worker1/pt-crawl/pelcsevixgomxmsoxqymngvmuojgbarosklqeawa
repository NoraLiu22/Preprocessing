<p><font color="#000000">I L<font size="-1">ATELY</font> A<font size="-1">TTENDED</font>
a meeting of the citizens of Concord, expecting, as one among many, to
speak on the subject of slavery in Massachusetts; but I was surprised and
disappointed to find that what had called my townsmen together was the
destiny of Nebraska,<font size="-1"><a href="#n">(1</a></font>) and not of
Massachusetts, and that what I had to say would be entirely out of order.
I had thought that the house was on fire, and not the prairie; but though
several of the citizens of Massachusetts are now in prison for attempting
to rescue a slave from her own clutches,<font size="-1"><a href="#n">(2)</a></font>
not one of the speakers at that meeting expressed regret for it, not one
even referred to it. It was only the disposition of some wild lands a thousand
miles off which appeared to concern them. The inhabitants of Concord are
not prepared to stand by one of their own bridges, but talk only of taking
up a position on the highlands beyond the Yellowstone River.<font size="-1"><a href="#n">(3)</a></font>
Our Buttricks and Davises and Hosmers<font size="-1"> <a href="#n">(4)</a></font>
are retreating thither, and I fear that they will leave no Lexington Common
between them and the enemy. There is not one slave in Nebraska; there are
perhaps a million slaves in Massachusetts.<font size="-1"><a href="#n">(5)</a></font></font>

They who have been bred in the school of politics fail now and always to
face the facts. Their measures are half measures and makeshifts merely.
They put off the day of settlement indefinitely, and meanwhile the debt
accumulates. Though the Fugitive Slave Law<font size="-1"> <a href="#n">(6)</a></font>
had not been the subject of discussion on that occasion, it was at length
faintly resolved by my townsmen, at an adjourned meeting, as I learn, that
the compromise compact of 1820 having been repudiated by one of the parties,
"Therefore,... the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 must be repealed." But this
is not the reason why an iniquitous law should be repealed. The fact which
the politician faces is merely that there is less honor among thieves than
was supposed, and not the fact that they are thieves.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[3]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As I had no opportunity to express my thoughts at that meeting, will you
allow me to do so here?

Again it happens that the Boston Court-House is full of armed men, holding
prisoner and trying a M<font size="-1">AN</font>, to find out if he is not
really a S<font size="-1">LAVE</font>. Does any one think that justice or
God awaits Mr. Loring's<font size="-1"> <a href="#n">(7)</a></font> decision?
For him to sit there deciding still, when this question is already decided
from eternity to eternity, and the unlettered slave himself and the multitude
around have long since heard and assented to the decision, is simply to
make himself ridiculous. We may be tempted to ask from whom he received
his commission, and who he is that received it; what novel statutes he
obeys, and what precedents are to him of authority. Such an arbiter's very
existence is an impertinence. We do not ask him to make up his mind, but
to make up his pack.

I listen to hear the voice of a Governor,<font size="-1"><a href="#n">(8)</a></font>
Commander-in-Chief of the forces of Massachusetts. I hear only the creaking
of crickets and the hum of insects which now fill the summer air. The Governor's
exploit is to review the troops on muster days. I have seen him on horseback,
with his hat off, listening to a chaplain's prayer. It chances that that
is all I have ever seen of a Governor. I think that I could manage to get
along without one. If <i>he</i> is not of the least use to prevent my being
kidnapped, pray of what important use is he likely to be to me? When freedom
is most endangered, he dwells in the deepest obscurity. A distinguished
clergyman told me that he chose the profession of a clergyman because it
afforded the most leisure for literary pursuits. I would recommend to him
the profession of a Governor.

Three years ago, also, when the Sims tragedy<font size="-1"> <a href="#n">(9)</a></font>
was acted, I said to myself, There is such an officer, if not such a man,
as the Governor of Massachusetts � what has he been about the last fortnight?
Has he had as much as he could do to keep on the fence during this moral
earthquake? It seemed to me that no keener satire could have been aimed
at, no more cutting insult have been offered to that man, than just what
happened � the absence of all inquiry after him in that crisis. The worst
and the most I chance to know of him is that he did not improve that opportunity
to make himself known, and worthily known. He could at least have <i>resigned</i>
himself into fame. It appeared to be forgotten that there was such a man
or such an office. Yet no doubt he was endeavoring to fill the gubernatorial
chair all the while. He was no Governor of mine. He did not govern me.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[7]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But at last, in the present case, the Governor was heard from. After he
and the United States government had perfectly succeeded in robbing a poor
innocent black man of his liberty for life, and, as far as they could,
of his Creator's likeness in his breast, he made a speech to his accomplices,
at a congratulatory supper!

<br><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[8]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have read a recent law of this State, making it penal for any officer
of the "Commonwealth" to "detain or aid in the... detention," anywhere
within its limits, "of any person, for the reason that he is claimed as
a fugitive slave." Also, it was a matter of notoriety that a writ of replevin
<font size="-1"><a href="#n">(10)</a></font>
to take the fugitive out of the custody of the United States Marshal could
not be served for want of sufficient force to aid the officer.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[9]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I had thought that the Governor was, in some sense, the executive officer
of the State; that it was his business, as a Governor, to see that the
laws of the State were executed; while, as a man, he took care that he
did not, by so doing, break the laws of humanity; but when there is any
special important use for him, he is useless, or worse than useless, and
permits the laws of the State to go unexecuted. Perhaps I do not know what
are the duties of a Governor; but if to be a Governor requires to subject
one's self to so much ignominy without remedy, if it is to put a restraint
upon my manhood, I shall take care never to be Governor of Massachusetts.
I have not read far in the statutes of this Commonwealth. It is not profitable
reading. They do not always say what is true; and they do not always mean
what they say. What I am concerned to know is, that that man's influence
and authority were on the side of the slaveholder, and not of the slave
� of the guilty, and not of the innocent � of injustice, and not of justice.
I never saw him of whom I speak; indeed, I did not know that he was Governor
until this event occurred. I heard of him and Anthony Burns at the same
time, and thus, undoubtedly, most will hear of him. So far am I from being
governed by him. I do not mean that it was anything to his discredit that
I had not heard of him, only that I heard what I did. The worst I shall
say of him is, that he proved no better than the majority of his constituents
would be likely to prove. In my opinion, be was not equal to the occasion.

The whole military force of the State is at the service of a Mr. Suttle,
a slaveholder from Virginia, to enable him to catch a man whom he calls
his property; but not a soldier is offered to save a citizen of Massachusetts
from being kidnapped! Is this what all these soldiers, all this <i>training</i>,
have been for these seventy-nine years past?<font size="-1"><a href="#n">(11</a></font>)
Have they been trained merely to rob Mexico and carry back fugitive slaves
to their masters?
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[11]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These very nights I heard the sound of a drum in our streets. There were
men
<i>training</i> still; and for what? I could with an effort pardon
the cockerels of Concord for crowing still, for they, perchance, had not
been beaten that morning; but I could not excuse this rub-a-dub of the
"trainers." The slave was carried back by exactly such as these; i.e.,
by the soldier, of whom the best you can say in this connection is that
he is a fool made conspicuous by a painted coat.

<br><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[12]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Three years ago, also, just a week after the authorities of Boston assembled
to carry back a perfectly innocent man, and one whom they knew to be innocent,
into slavery,<font size="-1"><a href="#n">(12)</a></font> the inhabitants
of Concord caused the bells to be rung and the cannons to be fired, to
celebrate their liberty � and the courage and love of liberty of their
ancestors who fought at the bridge.<font size="-1"><a href="#n2">(13)</a></font>
As if <i>those</i> three millions had fought for the right to be free themselves,
but to hold in slavery three million others. Nowadays, men wear a fool's-cap,
and call it a liberty-cap.<font size="-1"><a href="#n2">(14)</a></font> I
do not know but there are some who, if they were tied to a whipping-post,
and could but get one hand free, would use it to ring the bells and fire
the cannons to celebrate
<i>their</i> liberty. So some of my townsmen took
the liberty to ring and fire. That was the extent of their freedom; and
when the sound of the bells died away, their liberty died away also; when
the powder was all expended, their liberty went off with the smoke.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[13]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The joke could be no broader if the inmates of the prisons were to subscribe
for all the powder to be used in such salutes, and hire the jailers to
do the firing and ringing for them, while they enjoyed it through the grating.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[14]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is what I thought about my neighbors.

<br><font size="-1"><font color="#919191">[</font><font color="#666666">15]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Every humane and intelligent inhabitant of Concord, when he or she heard
those bells and those cannons, thought not with pride of the events of
the 19th of April, 1775,<font size="-1"><a href="#n2">(15)</a></font> but
with shame of the events of the 12th of April, 1851.<font size="-1"><a href="#n2">(16)</a></font>
But now we have half buried that old shame under a new one.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[16]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Massachusetts sat waiting Mr. Loring's decision, as if it could in any
way affect her own criminality. Her crime, the most conspicuous and fatal
crime of all, was permitting him to be the umpire in such a case. It was
really the trial of Massachusetts. Every moment that she hesitated to set
this man free � every moment that she now hesitates to atone for her crime,
she is convicted. The Commissioner on her case is God; not Edward G. God,
but simply God.

I wish my countrymen to consider, that whatever the human law may be, neither
an individual nor a nation can ever commit the least act of injustice against
the obscurest individual without having to pay the penalty for it. A government
which deliberately enacts injustice, and persists in it, will at length
even become the laughing-stock of the world.<font size="-1"><a href="#n2">(17)</a></font>
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[18]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Much has been said about American slavery, but I think that we do not even
yet realize what slavery is. If I were seriously to propose to Congress
to make mankind into sausages, I have no doubt that most of the members
would smile at my proposition, and if any believed me to be in earnest,
they would think that I proposed something much worse than Congress had
ever done. But if any of them will tell me that to make a man into a sausage
would be much worse � would be any worse � than to make him into a slave
� than it was to enact the Fugitive Slave Law, I will accuse him of foolishness,
of intellectual incapacity, of making a distinction without a difference.
The one is just as sensible a proposition as the other.

<br><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[19]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hear a good deal said about trampling this law under foot. Why, one need
not go out of his way to do that. This law rises not to the level of the
head or the reason; its natural habitat is in the dirt. It was born and
bred, and has its life, only in the dust and mire, on a level with the
feet; and he who walks with freedom, and does not with Hindoo mercy avoid
treading on every venomous reptile, will inevitably tread on it, and so
trample it under foot � and Webster,<font size="-1"><a href="#n2">(18)</a></font>
its maker, with it, like the dirt-bug and its ball.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[20]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recent events will be valuable as a criticism on the administration of
justice in our midst, or, rather, as showing what are the true resources
of justice in any community. It has come to this, that the friends of liberty,
the friends of the slave, have shuddered when they have understood that
his fate was left to the legal tribunals of the country to be decided.
Free men have no faith that justice will be awarded in such a case. The
judge may decide this way or that; it is a kind of accident, at best. It
is evident that he is not a competent authority in so important a case.
It is no time, then, to be judging according to his precedents, but to
establish a precedent for the future. I would much rather trust to the
sentiment of the people. In their vote you would get something of some
value, at least, however small; but in the other case, only the trammeled
judgment of an individual, of no significance, be it which way it might.

It is to some extent fatal to the courts, when the people are compelled
to go behind them. I do not wish to believe that the courts were made for
fair weather, and for very civil cases merely; but think of leaving it
to any court in the land to decide whether more than three millions of
people, in this case a sixth part of a nation, have a right to be freemen
or not! But it has been left to the courts of <i>justice</i>, so called
� to the Supreme Court of the land � and, as you all know, recognizing
no authority but the Constitution, it has decided that the three millions
are and shall continue to be slaves.<font size="-1"><a href="#n2">(19)</a></font>
Such judges as these are merely the inspectors of a pick-lock and murderer's
tools, to tell him whether they are in working order or not, and there
they think that their responsibility ends. There was a prior case on the
docket, which they, as judges appointed by God, had no right to skip; which
having been justly settled, they would have been saved from this humiliation.
It was the case of the murderer himself.
<p><font size="-1"><font color="#666666">[22]</font><font color="#919191">&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The law will never make men free; it is men who have got to make the law
free. They are the lovers of law and order who observe the law when the
government breaks it.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[23]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Among human beings, the judge whose words seal the fate of a man furthest
into eternity is not he who merely pronounces the verdict of the law, but
he, whoever he may be, who, from a love of truth, and unprejudiced by any
custom or enactment of men, utters a true opinion or <i>sentence</i> concerning
him. He it is that <i>sentences</i> him. Whoever can discern truth has
received his commission from a higher source than the chiefest justice
in the world who can discern only law. He finds himself constituted judge
of the judge. Strange that it should be necessary to state such simple
truths!

I am more and more convinced that, with reference to any public question,
it is more important to know what the country thinks of it than what the
city thinks. The city does not <i>think</i> much. On any moral question,
I would rather have the opinion of Boxboro<font size="-1"> <a href="#n2">(20)</a></font>
than of Boston and New York put together. When the former speaks, I feel
as if somebody
<i>had</i> spoken, as if <i>humanity</i> was yet, and a
reasonable being had asserted its rights � as if some unprejudiced men
among the country's hills had at length turned their attention to the subject,
and by a few sensible words redeemed the reputation of the race. When,
in some obscure country town, the farmers come together to a special town-meeting,
to express their opinion on some subject which is vexing the land, that,
I think, is the true Congress, and the most respectable one that is ever
assembled in the United States.

It is evident that there are, in this Commonwealth<font size="-1"> <a href="#n2">(21)</a></font>
at least, two parties, becoming more and more distinct � the party of the
city, and the party of the country. I know that the country is mean enough,
but I am glad to believe that there is a slight difference in her favor.
But as yet she has few, if any organs, through which to express herself.
The editorials which she reads, like the news, come from the seaboard.
Let us, the inhabitants of the country, cultivate self-respect. Let us
not send to the city for aught more essential than our broadcloths and
groceries; or, if we read the opinions of the city, let us entertain opinions
of our own.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[26]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Among measures to be adopted, I would suggest to make as earnest and vigorous
an assault on the press as has already been made, and with effect, on the
church. The church has much improved within a few years; but the press
is, almost without exception, corrupt. I believe that in this country the
press exerts a greater and a more pernicious influence than the church
did in its worst period. We are not a religious people, but we are a nation
of politicians. We do not care for the Bible, but we do care for the newspaper.
At any meeting of politicians � like that at Concord the other evening,
for instance � how impertinent it would be to quote from the Bible! how
pertinent to quote from a newspaper or from the Constitution! The newspaper
is a Bible which we read every morning and every afternoon, standing and
sitting, riding and walking. It is a Bible which every man carries in his
pocket, which lies on every table and counter, and which the mail, and
thousands of missionaries, are continually dispersing. It is, in short,
the only book which America has printed and which America reads. So wide
is its influence. The editor is a preacher whom you voluntarily support.
Your tax is commonly one cent daily, and it costs nothing for pew hire.
But how many of these preachers preach the truth? I repeat the testimony
of many an intelligent foreigner, as well as my own convictions, when I
say, that probably no country was ever rubled by so mean a class of tyrants
as, with a few noble exceptions, are the editors of the periodical press
in <i>this</i> country. And as they live and rule only by their servility,
and appealing to the worse, and not the better, nature of man, the people
who read them are in the condition of the dog that returns to his vomit.

The
<i>Liberator</i> and the <i>Commonwealth</i><font size="-1"> <a href="#n2">(22)</a></font>
were the only papers in Boston, as far as I know, which made themselves
heard in condemnation of the cowardice and meanness of the authorities
of that city, as exhibited in '51. The other journals, almost without exception,
by their manner of referring to and speaking of the Fugitive Slave Law,
and the carrying back of the slave Sims, insulted the common sense of the
country, at least. And, for the most part, they did this, one would say,
because they thought so to secure the approbation of their patrons, not
being aware that a sounder sentiment prevailed to any extent in the heart
of the Commonwealth. I am told that some of them have improved of late;
but they are still eminently time-serving. Such is the character they have
won.

But, thank fortune, this preacher can be even more easily reached by the
weapons of the reformer than could the recreant priest. The free men of
New England have only to refrain from purchasing and reading these sheets,
have only to withhold their cents, to kill a score of them at once. One
whom I respect told me that he purchased Mitchell's <i>Citizen </i><font size="-1"><a href="#n2">(23)</a></font>
in the cars, and then throw it out the window. But would not his contempt
have been more fatally expressed if he had not bought it?

Are they Americans? are they New Englanders? are they inhabitants of Lexington

Could slavery suggest a more complete servility than some of these journals
exhibit? Is there any dust which their conduct does not lick, and make
fouler still with its slime? I do not know whether the <i>Boston Herald
</i>is
still in existence <font size="-1"><a href="#n2">(24)</a></font>, but I remember
to have seen it about the streets when Sims was carried off. Did it not
act its part well-serve its master faithfully! How could it have gone lower
on its belly? How can a man stoop lower than he is low? do more than put
his extremities in the place of the head he has? than make his head his
lower extremity? When I have taken up this paper with my cuffs turned up,
I have heard the gurgling of the sewer through every column. I have felt
that I was handling a paper picked out of the public gutters, a leaf from

The majority of the men of the North, and of the South and East and West,
are not men of principle. If they vote, they do not send men to Congress
on errands of humanity; but while their brothers and sisters are being
scourged and hung for loving liberty, while � I might here insert all that
slavery implies and is � it is the mismanagement of wood and iron and stone
and gold which concerns them. Do what you will, O Government, with my wife
and children, my mother and brother, my father and sister, I will obey
your commands to the letter. It will indeed grieve me if you hurt them,
if you deliver them to overseers to be hunted by bounds or to be whipped
to death; but, nevertheless, I will peaceably pursue my chosen calling
on this fair earth, until perchance, one day, when I have put on mourning
for them dead, I shall have persuaded you to relent. Such is the attitude,
such are the words of Massachusetts.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[32]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rather than do thus, I need not say what match I would touch, what system
endeavor to blow up; but as I love my life, I would side with the light,
and let the dark earth roll from under me, calling my mother and my brother
to follow.

I would remind my countrymen that they are to be men first, and Americans
only at a late and convenient hour. No matter how valuable law may be to
protect your property, even to keep soul and body together, if it do not
keep you and humanity together.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[34]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am sorry to say that I doubt if there is a judge in Massachusetts who
is prepared to resign his office, and get his living innocently, whenever
it is required of him to pass sentence under a law which is merely contrary
to the law of God. I am compelled to see that they put themselves, or rather
are by character, in this respect, exactly on a level with the marine who
discharges his musket in any direction he is ordered to. They are just
as much tools, and as little men. Certainly, they are not the more to be
respected, because their master enslaves their understandings and consciences,
instead of their bodies.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[35]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The judges and lawyers � simply as such, I mean � and all men of expediency,
try this case by a very low and incompetent standard. They consider, not
whether the Fugitive Slave Law is right, but whether it is what they call
<i>constitutional</i>.
Is virtue constitutional, or vice? Is equity constitutional, or iniquity?
In important moral and vital questions, like this, it is just as impertinent
to ask whether a law is constitutional or not, as to ask whether it is
profitable or not. They persist in being the servants of the worst of men,
and not the servants of humanity. The question is, not whether you or your
grandfather, seventy years ago, did not enter into an agreement to serve
the Devil, and that service is not accordingly now due; but whether you
will not now, for once and at last, serve God � in spite of your own past
recreancy, or that of your ancestor � by obeying that eternal and only
just C<font size="-1">ONSTITUTION</font>, which He, and not any Jefferson
or Adams, has written in your being.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[36]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The amount of it is, if the majority vote the Devil to be God, the minority
will live and behave accordingly � and obey the successful candidate, trusting
that, some time or other, by some Speaker's casting-vote, perhaps, they
may reinstate God. This is the highest principle I can get out or invent
for my neighbors. These men act as if they believed that they could safely
slide down a hill a little way � or a good way � and would surely come
to a place, by and by, where they could begin to slide up again. This is
expediency, or choosing that course which offers the slightest obstacles
to the feet, that is, a downhill one. But there is no such thing as accomplishing
a righteous reform by the use of "expediency." There is no such thing as
sliding up hill. In morals the only sliders are backsliders.

Thus we steadily worship Mammon,<font size="-1"><a href="#n3">(25)</a></font>
both school and state and church, and on the seventh day curse God with
a tintamar<font size="-1"> <a href="#n3">(26)</a></font> from one end of
the Union to the other.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[38]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Will mankind never learn that policy is not morality � that it never secures
any moral right, but considers merely what is expedient? chooses the available
candidate � who is invariably the Devil � and what right have his constituents
to be surprised, because the Devil does not behave like an angel of light?
What is wanted is men, not of policy, but of probity � who recognize a
higher law than the Constitution, or the decision of the majority. The
fate of the country does not depend on how you vote at the polls � the
worst man is as strong as the best at that game; it does not depend on
what kind of paper you drop into the ballot-box once a year, but on what
kind of man you drop from your chamber into the street every morning.

slaveholding and servility. Let the State dissolve her union with the slaveholder.<font size="-1"><a href="#n3">(27)</a></font>
She may wriggle and hesitate, and ask leave to read the Constitution once
more; but she can find no respectable law or precedent which sanctions
the continuance of such a union for an instant.
<p><i>Right: advertisement for an abolitionist rally, with "Union with
Freemen - No Union with Slaveholders"</i>
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[40]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let each inhabitant of the State dissolve his union with her, as long as
she delays to do her duty.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[41]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The events of the past month teach me to distrust Fame. I see that she
does not finely discriminate, but coarsely hurrahs. She considers not the
simple heroism of an action, but only as it is connected with its apparent
consequences. She praises till she is hoarse the easy exploit of the Boston
tea party, but will be comparatively silent about the braver and more disinterestedly
heroic attack on the Boston Court-House, simply because it was unsuccessful!
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[42]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Covered with disgrace, the State has sat down coolly to try for their lives
and liberties the men who attempted to do its duty for it. And this is
called
<i>justice</i>! They who have shown that they can behave particularly
well may perchance be put under bonds for <i>their good behavior</i>. They
whom truth requires at present to plead guilty are, of all the inhabitants
of the State, preeminently innocent. While the Governor, and the Mayor,
and countless officers of the Commonwealth are at large, the champions
of liberty are imprisoned.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[43]&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp; <font color="#000000">O</font>nly
they are guiltless who commit the crime of contempt of such a court. It
behooves every man to see that his influence is on the side of justice,
and let the courts make their own characters. My sympathies in this case
are wholly with the accused, and wholly against their accusers and judges.
Justice is sweet and musical; but injustice is harsh and discordant. The
judge still sits grinding at his organ, but it yields no music, and we
hear only the sound of the handle. He believes that all the music resides
in the handle, and the crowd toss him their coppers the same as before.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[44]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do you suppose that that Massachusetts which is now doing these things
� which hesitates to crown these men, some of whose lawyers, and even judges,
perchance, may be driven to take refuge in some poor quibble, that they
may not wholly outrage their instinctive sense of justice � do you suppose
that she is anything but base and servile? that she is the champion of
liberty?
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[45]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Show me a free state, and a court truly of justice, and I will fight for
them, if need be; but show me Massachusetts, and I refuse her my allegiance,
and express contempt for her courts.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[46]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The effect of a good government is to make life more valuable � of a bad
one, to make it less valuable. We can afford that railroad and all merely
material stock should lose some of its value, for that only compels us
to live more simply and economically; but suppose that the value of life
itself should be diminished! How can we make a less demand on man and nature,
how live more economically in respect to virtue and all noble qualities,
than we do? I have lived for the last month � and I think that every man
in Massachusetts capable of the sentiment of patriotism must have had a
similar experience � with the sense of having suffered a vast and indefinite
loss. I did not know at first what ailed me. At last it occurred to me
that what I had lost was a country. I had never respected the government
near to which I lived, but I had foolishly thought that I might manage
to live here, minding my private affairs, and forget it. For my part, my
old and worthiest pursuits have lost I cannot say how much of their attraction,
and I feel that my investment in life here is worth many per cent less
since Massachusetts last deliberately sent back an innocent man, Anthony
Burns, to slavery. I dwelt before, perhaps, in the illusion that my life
passed somewhere only <i>between</i> heaven and hell, but now I cannot
persuade myself that I do not dwell <i>wholly within</i> hell. The site
of that political organization called Massachusetts is to me morally covered
with volcanic scoriae and cinders, such as Milton describes in the infernal
regions. If there is any hell more unprincipled than our rulers, and we,
the ruled, I feel curious to see it. Life itself being worth less, all
things with it, which minister to it, are worth less. Suppose you have
a small library, with pictures to adorn the walls � a garden laid out around
� and contemplate scientific and literary pursuits.&amp;c., and discover
all at once that your villa, with all its contents is located in hell,
and that the justice of the peace has a cloven foot and a forked tail �
do not these things suddenly lose their value in your eyes?
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[47]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I feel that, to some extent, the State has fatally interfered with my lawful
business. It has not only interrupted me in my passage through Court Street
on errands of trade, but it has interrupted me and every man on his onward
and upward path, on which he had trusted soon to leave Court Street far
behind. What right had it to remind me of Court Street? I have found that
hollow which even I had relied on for solid.
<p><font size="-1"><font color="#919191">[</font><font color="#666666">48]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am surprised to see men going about their business as if nothing had
happened. I say to myself, "Unfortunates! they have not heard the news."
I am surprised that the man whom I just met on horseback should be so earnest
to overtake his newly bought cows running away � since all property is
insecure, and if they do not run away again, they may be taken away from
him when he gets them. Fool! does he not know that his seed-corn is worth
less this year � that all beneficent harvests fail as you approach the
empire of hell? No prudent man will build a stone house under these circumstances,
or engage in any peaceful enterprise which it requires a long time to accomplish.
Art is as long as ever, but life is more interrupted and less available
for a man's proper pursuits. It is not an era of repose. We have used up
all our inherited freedom. If we would save our lives, we must fight for
them.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[49]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I walk toward one of our ponds; but what signifies the beauty of nature
when men are base? We walk to lakes to see our serenity reflected in them;
when we are not serene, we go not to them. Who can be serene in a country
where both the rulers and the ruled are without principle? The remembrance
of my country spoils my walk. My thoughts are murder to the State, and
involuntarily go plotting against her.
<p><img src="/web/20081108152931im_/http://eserver.org/thoreau/waterlily.jpg" hspace="16" vspace="8" border="1" height="223" width="185" align="RIGHT"><i>Left:
White water lily (Nymphaea odorata)</i>
<p><a name="50"></a><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[50]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But it chanced the other day that I scented a white water-lily, and a season
I had waited for had arrived. It is the emblem of purity. It bursts up
so pure and fair to the eye, and so sweet to the scent, as if to show us
what purity and sweetness reside in, and can be extracted from, the slime
and muck of earth. I think I have plucked the first one that has opened
for a mile. What confirmation of our hopes is in the fragrance of this
flower! I shall not so soon despair of the world for it, notwithstanding
slavery, and the cowardice and want of principle of Northern men. It suggests
what kind of laws have prevailed longest and widest, and still prevail,
and that the time may come when man's deeds will smell as sweet. Such is
the odor which the plant emits. If Nature can compound this fragrance still
annually, I shall believe her still young and full of vigor, her integrity
and genius unimpaired, and that there is virtue even in man, too, who is
fitted to perceive and love it. It reminds me that Nature has been partner
to no Missouri Compromise. I scent no compromise in the fragrance of the
water-lily. It is not a <i>Nymphoea Douglasii</i>.<font size="-1"><a href="#n3">(28)</a></font>
In it, the sweet, and pure, and innocent are wholly sundered from the obscene
and baleful. I do not scent in this the time-serving irresolution of a
Massachusetts Governor, nor of a Boston Mayor. So behave that the odor
of your actions may enhance the general sweetness of the atmosphere, that
when we behold or scent a flower, we may not be reminded how inconsistent
your deeds are with it; for all odor is but one form of advertisement of
a moral quality, and if fair actions had not been performed, the lily would
not smell sweet. The foul slime stands for the sloth and vice of man, the
decay of humanity; the fragrant flower that springs from it, for the purity
and courage which are immortal.
<p><font color="#666666"><font size="-1">[51]</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Slavery and servility have produced no sweet-scented flower annually, to
charm the senses of men, for they have no real life: they are merely a
decaying and a death, offensive to all healthy nostrils. We do not complain
that they
<i>live</i>, but that they do not get <i>buried</i>. Let the
living bury them: even they are good for manure.

 by <i>Mario Fabretto</i>, 13 July 1997
<p>
This flag is quite common on  flag books and charts from the middle of 18th
Century and until the middle of the 19th Century. Among them I remember 
<a href="bib-nfa.html#noh48a">Norie/Hobbs (1848)</a>, 
<a href="bib-hua.html#hvr83">Rosenfeld (1883)</a>, Flaggen Almanack (ca. 1844). It doesn't appear on Le Gras (1858), so I think that its use ended in the first half of the 19th
Century. The only thing we can say is that flags with many stripes and irregular shape were quite common for the ships sailing from north African ports. From many captured flags we also know that similar flags were used on land also, but with different colors and arrangements. The particular use of them is obscure. <br>
<i>Mario Fabretto</i>, 13 July 1997
<p>
I recently saw a French encyclopedia, the 'Grand Dictionnaire Universelle du XIXe Si�cle' (Paris 1865), which describes some very different flags for Tunisia, Egypt and Tripoli. There are no illustrations, but the text [for Tunisia] reads as follows:

<blockquote>
Tunis: "Rouge, avec croissant et �toile dans un cercle blanc."  In other words, the current national flag of Tunisia.
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="bey">Bey of Tunis</a></h2>
<p><a href="/web/20080618212828/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/t/tn-tunez.gif">
<img src="/web/20080618212828im_/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/t/tn-tunez.gif" border="0" alt="[Bey of Tunis]" width="305" height="217"></a> 
 by <i>Jaume Oll&eacute;</i>, July 1997</p>
<p>
<a href="bib-neu.html#neu39">Flaggenbuch (1939)</a> shows this flag as a 
rectangular flag of nine stripes, the middle one being of double width and green 
while others are of equal width and alternating yellow and red, i.e. top to 
bottom YRYRVVRYRY. The green stripe contains the sword of Ali, a split edge 
dagger in white with multicoloured handle (to hoist). The yellow and red stripes 
contain five symbols each equally spaced and regularly ordered, so that the 
topmost stripe has same elements as the bottommost one, the second stripe same 
as the penultimate and so on. There are two kind of symbols - a six-pointed star 
voided with a disk of different colour, and a disk voided with another smaller 
disk of other colour off-centered toward the fly and down. Each of the two appears 
in two different colour combinations; the star can be red with green disk or 
white with blue disk, while the disk can be blue with red disk or green with 
yellow disk. The first (yellow) stripe contains red star, blue disk, red star, 
blue disk and red star. The second stripe has the green disk, white star, green 
disk, white star green disk. The third stripe (second yellow stripe) has the 
same as the first but the central star is white (actually only above the sword,
its red star below). The fourth stripe is then the same as the second one.

<p>
The magnificent flag of the Bey shown here, drawn by Jaume Oll&eacute; has a few 
minor differences (stars voided in blue are coloured white in Flaggenbuch, there 
are also white elements in the sword handle and probably a few even lesser ones; 
if Jaume was working from Flaggenbuch as source, these might be result of white elements being rendered as &quot;transparent&quot; by some error, or some other source 
might have such differences).<p>
This flag was originally reported as dating from the 19th Century. There have 
been some 15 beys since the beginning of 19th Century until the proclamation of 
the republic in 1957. In 1881 Tunisia became a French protectorate, but the flag 
may be older than that as Tunisia was <i>de facto</i> independent from the 
Ottomans entirely since 1871 and even before that much autonomy was practiced 
since before 18th Century. So, it is hard to assume anything about the adoption 
dates, while the abandonment should be easier: in 1957 the republic was 
proclaimed, so the bey's standard was used, presumably, for a year after the 
end of the French protectorate. (Or was it?)<p>
I recalled the beylical standard was mentioned in an article on Tunisian flags 
in <a href="bib-smi.html#smi00j">The Flag Bulletin</a>, no. 195, Sep.-Oct. 2000, 
pp. 171-194. Quoting Smith from pp.185-186:<br>
<br>
&quot;Another flag (Fig. 15), possibly introduced by Bey Hussein II, served on many 
occasions -- including the proclamation of the new Ottoman constitution on 21 
March 1840. Referred to as the &quot;state standard of the Regency,&quot; (32) this flag 
was more than simply a personal banner of the ruler, although it appeared at&nbsp; 
ceremonies and visits in which the bey participated (33). It was regularly used 
on the Bardo Palace, on the Citadel of Tunis, and on navy ships (34).<br>
<br>
&quot;The design of the standard (35) varied somewhat over the years, but the basic 
elements were constant. (...) A simplified version of the standard (four stripes 
alternately green and red with sword of Ali overall in white) appeared on the 
white oval shield in the arms of the Regency, officially adopted in 1861 but in 
use earlier (Fig. 16) -- a rare example of a flag serving as the principal 
charge in the coat of arms of a country.&quot;<br>

(33) Si Hassen Hosni Abdel-Wahab, &quot;Note on the History of the Tunisian Flag&quot; 
(Tunis, 1957), p. 3. The author claimed the standard was already three centuries 
old.<br>

appears in [smi75], p. 55, is an illustration from 1835 reproduced from the 
Verzameling.<br>
<i>Santiago Dotor</i>, 16 April 2003<p>
The Bey's standard shown in <a href="bib-pra.html#pre17">National Geographic 
(1917)</a> is somewhat different from the <a href="bib-neu.html#neu39">Flaggenbuch (1939)</a> 
version, with a long description and explanation.<br>

<h2><a name="oth">Other Historical Flags of Tunisia</a></h2>
<p>Franciae Vexilla (#15/61, September 1999) has a colour plate showing historical flags of Tunisia, entitled "Les anc<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>tres du drapeau tunisien". (Ancestors of the Tunisian flag).&nbsp;Tunisia was nominally under Ottoman rule from 1574 to 1881 (French military intervention).&nbsp;According to Pierre 
Charri<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), ensigns with six horizontal white and red stripes or with green and red stripes were reported as soon as 1756. The dates reported below correspond to the publication year of each source, when available. Captions are by Jean Renault.&nbsp;<br>

 Rectangular dark yellow field with incurvated tail and a white crescent pointing upwards. About 3:5. [Charles V le Sage (1338-1380), king of France (1364-1380), gathered a huge collection of manuscripts.] [Gabes is a port of southern Tunisia located on the eponymous gulf.]&nbsp;

 Charles V Atlas (1375), "Tunis". As Charles V Atlas (1375), "Gabes", but with red field and red
 fringes along the tail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 <a href="bib-zih.html#zna00">Znamierowski (2000)</a> (French edition: <i>
 Encyclopedie mondiale des drapeaux</i>) shows on p. 104 (section 'the Muslim 
 crescent') three flags made of a crescent pointing upward on a monocolour 
 field. The Gabes flag is a white crescent pointing upward on a rectangular 
 orange field. The Tlemcen flag is a blue crescent pointing upward on an white 
 field. Tlemcen, now called Tilimsi since the Algerian toponymic reform, was the 
 capital of the Central Maghreb in the 14th-16th Centuries. The Tunis flag is 
 a white crescent pointing upward on an red field.<br>
 <br>
 Unfortunately, Znamierowski does not give precise sources for these three 
 flags. He mentions, however, that the first flags with the crescent appeared on 
 portolans and navigation maps of 14th Century. The 'Libro de Conoscimiento'
(14th Century) shows several flags with a crescent (placement not precisely 
 described) on a white field:<br>
 - Kings of Damas and Lucania: yellow crescent<br>
 - Cairo: blue crescent<br>
 - Mahdia (Tunisia): purple crescent<br>
 - Tunis: black crescent. <a href="#14th">Image shown here</a>.<br>
 - Buda: red crescent.<br>
 It is not clear from the text if 'Cairo' flag was the flag of Cairo or king of 
 Cairo. Same for the three other ones. Znamierowski adds that portolans from the
 14th-16th Centuries often showed for Tunis one or two white crescents on a red 
 field. Examples of such renditions are shown here.<br>

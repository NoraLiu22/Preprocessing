<p>I have dozens of different resources that I use when I am researching the mythical beings of the Philippines.  I often lament about what a pain in the butt it is to pull them all out every time I get curious about a mythical being.  I thought, wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if a place existed where I could access the names of all the documented creatures and the regions from which they come?  I decided it was time that somebody took on the task &#8211; so here it is! There are over 260 mythical beings listed and, with your help,  I hope to continue adding to this list.</p>

<p>These creatures can be confusing to say the least.  First, there are just so many!  With over 7000 islands, and the number of individual languages listed for Philippines at 187 (according to ethnologue.com), it&#8217;s actually a surprise there aren&#8217;t more.</p>

The creature stood and walked toward them for a distance of twenty-five meters before they ran away. The creature was black and twice as tall as an ordinary man. The agta of the East Visayas “are said to live in mangroves and . . . swampy places.” The most frequented home of demons in the Philippines is the Ficus indica, commonly known as the balete tree. The agta reported to have been seen in Barrio Palanas, Masbate, by the above informant carried a rattan cane, but this is the only creature shown by the data to be provided with this elegant appurtenance. The Agta reported most often in Leyte smoked a large cigar and it can usually be seen in a standing position. Benilda Moreno (from Barrio Gabas, Baybay, Leyte) said that an agta once ordered some night fishermen not to proceed, blocking their river route with large trees which it had knocked down to give force to its demand. Virginia Taglucop reported seeing an agta smoke, between eight in the evening and four the next morning, under a santol tree in which it resided. Although they share similar traits, the Agta should not be considered a ‘variety’ of kapre, but instead one of the many tall, black, tree dwellers that have been (mis)classified under that umbrella term.</p>

<p>Shapeshifting demon, humanlike by day but transform into different monstrous form at night. By day, they look like a beautiful, silent maidens dwelling in a simple nipa hut, but by night Bird they become a terrible fiend that feeds to human flesh and blood. They can make humans be like them whenever they serve flesh food (which is actually human flesh) and whenever you swallow something inflicted by their saliva. Their power can be also transferred just like that of Amaranhig.  They harass and eat awake humans at night, especially pregnant women who are about to give birth. Aswangs can change from a human to an animal form, usually as a bat, a pig or a black dog. Some aswangs can change form at will, others through the use of foul oils concocted by evil magicians. Aswangs appear at night to prey upon unwary travelers or sleeping people. It is said that they have a peculiar liking for the taste of human liver. The myth of the Aswang is popular in the Visayas, especially in provinces such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190327145840/https://www.aswangproject.com/the-truth-about-the-aswang-in-capiz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capiz</a>, Antique, and Iloilo. Aswangs also have a peculiar liking for the fetus of pregnant women and are said to find their quarry by the scent of the mother, which to the aswang smells like ripe jackfruit. Upon finding the house of the pregnant mother, the aswang alights on the roof from where it stretches its tongue until it is as thin as a thread and uses it to enter the womb and feast on the fetus.</p>
<p>The term Aswang can also be considered as a generic name for Filipino vampiric creatures, such as Manananggal, Tiktik and many more. <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190327145840/https://www.aswangproject.com/aswang-phenomenon-documentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Learn more about the Aswang)</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>ASWANG NA GALA</strong>  &#8211; <em>(Eastern Visayas)</em> (Wandering Aswang) A psychic blood sucker, it feeds directly on the energy of sick, weary, stressed, or dying persons. It appears very human, with some working in hospitals as nurses to feed on the patients. An Aswang na Gala can be identified by staring into its eyes, which reflect images upside-down. Sometimes it feeds on the life force of the fetus inside an expectant mother’s womb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

After taking its clothes off, it applies under its armpits a green ointment made of herbs and fat, before rising into the night. It rides the current, as though swimming on its back, in search of a fresh corpse. Finding one, it takes only the liver and swiftly departs. It is never known to feed on living men, although reported cases of dead farm animals with missing livers have been blamed on the Aswang na Lupad. Citrus fruits take away its ability to fly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ASWANG SA KALIBONAN</strong> &#8211; <em>(Eastern Visayas)  </em>(Aswang of the Forest, Aswang sa Talon) An ancient Aswang who lives away from humans and resides in the deepest part of the forest.

Underling Aswangs share their spoils to the Aswang sa Kalibonan.</p>

<p><strong>BACOBACO &#8211; </strong><em>(Zambales) </em>In 1915, Henry Otley Beyer recorded a myth of the Ayta living in Zambales that sounds very much like a volcanic eruption of Pinatubo. The battle is between Algao, which may be northern name for the Sun (related to Aldo), and Bacobaco, a great sea turtle.  In this account Algao and Bacobaco have a great battle in which the latter eventually bores into the top of Pinatubo creating a great crater and emitting great flames, huge rocks, mud, ashes, smoke and deafening noise in the process. According to the legend, Bacobaco continued to dwell in the mountain and when he comes out <em>&#8220;woe be to us.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BAGAT</strong> &#8211; <em>(Western Visayas)  </em>In Western Visayas folklore, Aswangs or other beings that turn into fantastic or terrifying creatures to scare or waylay travelers anytime they want. Some may even chase the terrified victim just for the fun of it. One way to discourage the Bagat is to wrestle one and bite its thumb hard until it submits and begs to be freed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BAG-ONG YANGGAW</strong> &#8211; <em>(Western Visayas) </em> Humans who have just been turned into Aswangs. Having just acquired their abilities, the Bag-ong Yanggaw are weaker than other Aswangs but still fast and strong enough to kill a human. They can shape-shift into an animal but for a limited time only as their concentration is not yet fully developed. Having acquired an insatiable appetite for humans, they could be careless sometimes which often results to foiled attacks. Some may even doubt their selves, desperately clinging to their humanity, and seek to be rid of their condition.</p>

It can transform into a human or a pig, where it will use this guise to sneak into a village and steal a pig or a human for its consumption.  When villagers detect a rotting smell, they know a Biangonan is near.  They will light a large fire which is believed to ward it off.  The Biangonan devours every part of the human they steal from the village, but will leave the jaw bone of the victim hanging in a tree.  An alternate description appears in <em>&#8220;The Encyclopedia of Philippine Folk Beliefs and Customs Volume 1&#8221;</em> : The Batak believe that biangonan are small people possessed of talons who hide in rocks and trees. When they attack their victims, they utter long piercing shrieks that paralyze their victims. Then they tear and claw at the throat of the helpless man.</p>

He has two sets of wings, whiskers, a red tongue, and a mouth ‘the size of a lake.’ The Filipinos once thought that the Bakunawa lived in the sea at a time when the world had seven moons that the serpents, being fascinated by their light, would rise out of the sea into the sky and consume the moons. Thus, the serpents were the cause of lunar eclipses. To prevent the world from becoming dark the people would run out of their homes, taking their pots and pans, to make the most noise they could in order to scare the Bakunawa so they would stop eating the moons, and give them the moonlight back. But in some versions, these serpents also devour the sun in which case also cause the solar eclipse. <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190327145840/https://www.aswangproject.com/bakunawa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Learn more about Bakunawa)</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190327145840/https://www.aswangproject.com/manananggal-wakwak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MANANANGGAL</strong> </a> &#8211; <em>(Bikol, Tagalog)</em> A flying fiend, and carries only half its body, bodies are cut in half at night. Some says, like Aswang, by day, they are beautiful maidens living in a nipa hut, by night, they rub a kind of oil to their whole body which gives them the power to separate themselves into two &#8211; the upper part which she carries with bat-like wings, and the lower part which they live, then goes back to connect its upper part before the dawn.</p>
<p>Manananggal is an aswang that can fly after separating itself from the lower half of its body. It eats babies and fetuses from a mother&#8217;s womb. It eats babies by means of passing their long tongue through a small hole from the roof of a house. The sharp end of the tongue touches the mother&#8217;s navel to suck the blood of the fetus or unborn child.</p>
<p>A manananggal can also be a sorceress that visits villages and barrios. To feed, the self-segmenter chooses an isolated place where she will leave her lower torso while she hunts at night.Bird When she separates from her lower torso, she then gains her ability to fly. She then goes off in search of houses where pregnant women reside. Upon choosing a suitable victim, the Manananggal alights on the house and inserts her tongue through the roof. The tongue is long, hollow and extremely flexible. She uses it to puncture the womb of the sleeping woman and to suck out the fetus. At other times, she seduces men with her beauty and lures them to a private place before eating them alive. She usually eats the insides, like the heart, stomach or the liver. Sunlight is deadly to the Manananggal when she is in her monstrous form. Should her two halves still be separate with the coming of dawn, she will be destroyed. According to legend, to destroy the Manananggal, one should search for the lower torso that she leaves behind during her nightly hunts. Salt, ash, and/or garlic should then be placed on the exposed flesh, preventing the monster from combining again and leaving it vulnerable to sunlight. Small containers of salt, ash, and raw rice, and the smell of burning rubber are said to deter the Manananggal from approaching one&#8217;s house. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190327145840/https://www.aswangproject.com/manananggal-wakwak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(learn more)</a></p>

If you put your clothes inside out the tambaloslos finds it so funny it will laugh so hard it will cover its eyes with its enormous upper lip, giving the victim a chance to escape.</p>
<p>Tambaloslos is a slang word in the Cebuano language. It is used to mean a useless or an inept male. It is seldom used to refer to a woman.  It is a vulgar word and is not used in polite or formal conversation. Occasionally people say it to elicit a humorous effect. The suffix “loslos “is a slang term for the male genitalia.</p>

<p><strong>From Bikol: </strong>It got its name from the long, wrinkled penis and dangling testicles which dangles to the ground (luslus).</p>
<p>An awkward, lanky, wrinkled black creature, it has long, thin, wobbly legs, hooves and big joints. It has long, thin arms and fingers and a mane like that of a horse that went all the way down from the head to the buttocks. It has wide protruding lips that covers its face when it laughs.</p>

<p>The Tambaluslos chases people who wander in the woods. The only way to escape it is to take off your clothes and wear them upside-down. The creature finds this act very hilarious and it will laugh so much that its wide lips would cover its face, therefore preventing it from seeing the victim who in turn will have ample time to escape.</p>
<p><strong>Bicol, Bisaya, Mindanao: </strong>from ‘luslos’ or to have an erection</p>
<p>Takes women into secluded areas. To escape ones must turn their clothes inside out so that the tambaloslos can see their breast, this will make the tambaloslos erect so much that its genitals will cover its vision.</p>

Called by the people from the mountain as <em>“cha tagun ajipun maila”</em> (people who can’t be seen), Tinakchi seems to be on par with the likes of Engkanto, Palasekan and Tahamaling who exist along side people, while hiding their presence.

These phantasms return into the mortal realm in the form of goblins to eat living victims. The tiyanak can also be the offspring of a woman and a demon. It can also be an aborted fetus which comes back to take revenge on its mother. Most Tiyanaks are said to live in forests. If they see a human, they transform into what looks like a normal baby. When the person notices the Tiyanak and comes near to take a look at it, the Tiyanak changes back to its true form and eats its prey.</p>
<p>The true origin of Tiyanak came from the Malaysian creature, Pontianak or Mantianak &#8211; a female viscera. They share many similarities, but the Pontianak is the mother who died while pregnant, Tianak is the ghost of the child, not the mother herself.</p>
<p>Whenever we hear Tiyanak, the first thing which come to our mind is an innocent-looking baby, but according to some, they look like dwendes (small earth spirit). You can kill this monster by means of any pointed instruments, more specifically pointed metal made of silver.</p>

<p><strong>TIYU-AN</strong> &#8211; <em>(Capiz) </em>A flightless variant of the Manananggal originating from Capiz. This one doesn’t have wings and doesn’t split her body in half. Instead, the Tiyu-an jumps on the roof of a victim or enters the house unnoticed. It will then extend its tongue into a very long and thin proboscis and pierce the belly of a pregnant woman and suck the blood of the fetus inside. In some cases it will lick and sniff a severely ill person, sucking the life force until the victim dies. The Tiyu-an is only female and owns a puppy that never grows old. It is said the puppy, which is passed from one generation to another is actually the master from whom she got her powers. When this mutt licks the Tiyu-an, its telling her that it is hungry and it’s time for her to hunt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUBTUB</strong> &#8211; <em>(Antique) </em>An Aswang variant in Libertad, Antique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TULUNG/ TUWUNG</strong>  &#8211;  <em>(Zambales Negrito)</em> The Negrito version of the Tikbalang. A horse-like head similar to the tikbalang. What sets the tulung apart from the tikbalang is that instead of hooves, it has clawed feet and very large penis and testicles.</p>

The Ugaws live near rice granaries or follow humans where there is an abundance of rice. They move swiftly and people are advised to close the lids of their rice bins to prevent Ugaws from stealing them.  They know by the spillage some people leave by their bins.</p>
<p>The Iloko word naugaw describes a person wasteful of rice. It is derived from ugaw, an elf. The folk level the rice in a bin and place an inverted coconut-shell bowl on it to keep elves away. A string of empty snails is also laced around the neck of a jar used as a rice bin to keep elves away by the tinkle of the shells when these creatures clamber up the sides of the bin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UGKOY </strong> &#8211;  <em>(Waray)</em> Usually seen in rivers during floods.  Drags victims by their feet (like a crocodile) into the water.</p>

					<p>This research is courtesy of the statistics at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/">Google Ngram viewer</a>. The basis for this discussion is a list of frequency of words and their usage in the English language. Google has scanned and analyzed a large body of books from 1800 to 2000. Words and their frequency can be graphed over time to help analyze their popularity and usage in language media.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/waterspherechart.png"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/waterspherechart-320x117.png" alt="" title="Water Sphere NGram" width="320" height="117" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-341"/></a>In the first graph, the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere researchers have graphed the usage of the word &#8220;water&#8221; versus the word &#8220;sphere&#8221;. From the chart one can see the data for the word water (in blue) has a popular roller coaster trip over the years 1800 through 2000. It seems the popularity of the word peaked shortly before 1920. Why is this? Were steam engines, locomotives, and battle ships dominating the news? Were people wondering where these engines were to find water to fill their boilers?</p>
<p>In contrasting form, the data for the word &#8220;sphere&#8221; (in red) has a steady popularity, never rising or falling much. Perhaps the usefulness and wonder of the spheres has been constant since Euclidean times.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/waterspheretogetherchart.png"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/waterspheretogetherchart-320x117.png" alt="" title="Water Sphere Chart" width="320" height="117" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-342"/></a>The most interesting insight comes to light when one analyzes the frequency of the words &#8220;water sphere&#8221;. This chart shows a steady rise from 1880 (the dawn of the steel-building era) to 1960.  Then, in the early 1960s, when people began to experiment with expanded consciousness and free love, &#8220;water sphere&#8221; usage rockets into the stratosphere. Later in the 1980s, when people were tired of wearing leather and lycra, and Molly Ringwald stopped making movies, interest in &#8220;water sphere&#8221; returned to the calm, less frenzied frequencies of the 40s and 50s.</p>
<p>In our estimation, the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere (built in 1964) had a large effect on public consciousness. The Union water tower creation correlates to a rise in the frequency of &#8220;water sphere&#8221; use in the English language. At the same time, there was no increase in the frequency of use of the single words &#8220;water&#8221; or &#8220;sphere&#8221;. In fact, &#8220;water&#8221; usage declines during the 1960s. After the movement of water engineers and design to ellipsoidal water towers in the middle 1980s, the popularity for &#8220;water sphere&#8221; declines from the WTWS-induced hysteria. It is clear to witness the imprint of Union&#8217;s water tower on the psyche of the English language.</p>

This is an award that the Moog site in New York awards to retirees. You got to give credit to the Moog company. They love their water sphere, and being a true water sphere, it&#8217;s a work of art that should be preserved.</p>
<p>An art critic writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>Is this sculpture a bit creepy? Yes! Its squat neck yells out to be grabbed. The neck is so thick that this water sphere has no shoulders. This work looks more like a weapon or a handle than a water sphere. The World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere clearly has more beautiful proportions. The WTWS balances its globe precariously up in the heavens. The WTWS is the true work of art.</p></blockquote>

The water tower was completed on Wallops Island, Virginia in July of 2010. It stands 287 feet tall and holds 200,000. The water tank is used to service the nearby NASA launch pads.</p>
<p>Nice view of the tower, the construction equipment, and the backing Atlantic Ocean. Thanks Jason!<br/>

In fact the person suggests we rename the domain &#8220;worldssecondtallestwatersphere&#8221;.  A photo is attached and a link is given to information on a new 221 foot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMA1DP_Water_Tower_Braman_Oklahoma">water tower in Braman, Okalahoma</a>, built in May of 2010. Well, that sure is a beautiful water tower, and the white paint job must look great against a deep blue Oklahoma sky.</p>
<p>However, and we have stated this before, the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere of Union, New Jersey is still the world&#8217;s tallest water sphere.</p>
<p>If you look closely at the Braman tower, you can see that the top of the tower is not spherical. Ignore that conical neck collar underneath the dome for now, many towers have such a pedestal for added strength and volume. Look at the outline of the top of the tower. It is quite squashed and flattened. The Braman tower is in fact a water spheroid, not a water sphere.</p>
<p>The spheroid is inferior to the sphere. The spheroid looks like it has been deflated. The spheroid is less regular than a sphere. Imagine how silly the World Cup tournament would be played with a spheroid. Imagine trying to calculate the volume of a spheroid without a calculator. Imagine all the people living life in spheroids.</p>
<p>Some may marvel at tall water towers. Some may marvel at new water towers. However, we marvel at water spheres. The tall kind. The ones with a ball at the top. This site is dedicated to the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere.</p>

<p>Gina says, &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d like to see how<br/>
Nassau, Bahamas has handled the &#8216;clean municipal water supply&#8217; challenge. Not a bad effort, but it lacks the grace and style of our iconic water sphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed. It has a nice form and is prominently displayed. It must be visible from far at sea. However, imagine the impact on the islanders if there were a tall tower with crowning sphere lofted high above the palm trees. People would be navigating the waters to watch the sun and moon align with the tower. The impact on tourism and the local economy would be immense.</p>

The World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere site was interviewed for a segment back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/?p=114">January of 2009</a>.</p>
<p>Brian Donohue has won an Emmy award for his work in interactive media. With a love for the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere, New Jersey, and all it&#8217;s weirdness, what else could be done but to photograph the Emmy alongside the WTWS. We like the look! If ever there were structural problems, what else would be a better proposal than to have a giant, golden, art deco, statue prop the giant sphere?<br/>

The photo is taken from Route 78 in the Hillside area looking west.</p>
<p>As several readers have mentioned, there is an alignment of Sphere and Sun during two moments during the year when the Sun&#8217;s elliptical declination aligns perfectly behind the water tower. Can other readers guess what these dates are and the significance to the builders? One clue is that this photo taken in February is close to the date but not precisely aligned. Another clue is that there has been one moment in time when the Sun has been eclipsed by the Moon and the Moon has been eclipsed by the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere.</p>

Thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.ginalolacopywriter.com/">Gina Signorella-Arlen</a> who enlisted the help of her family in capturing this shot safely while navigating crowded swarms of swerving New Jersey drivers attempting to perform the same maneuver.</p>
<p>This is the terrifying image that millions witness every day. I love the color, the clouds, and the trees in this photo. Imagine the tension and fear that viewers might experience as they are driving along the New Jersey highways and seeing the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere for the first time.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;A steel tower appears on the horizon. Interesting, perhaps a water tower. That&#8217;s odd. It is the tallest water tower I have ever seen. It looks nearly white, and yet it blocks the sun behind it.</p>
<p>As I drive closer in the winter&#8217;s cold, the tower appears even taller, stretching its massive hammer head toward the clouds. It stands by an icy swamp. Dead trees and gray chill all around. Balanced, top heavy, apparently upside-down, it challenges gravity and defies the lashing winds.</p>
<p>Nearing, it appears to be too close to the road. Perhaps it is actually in the road? Am I going to have to swerve to avoid hitting this beast? By the second, I am coming closer to this monster. I cannot stop my car now. Maybe if I stay in this group of other vehicles it will not see me. Perhaps if I accelerate I can avoid being smashed by this giant gray steel bludgeon!</p>
<p>Now I am at its base. It reaches upwards scraping the cold gray sky. Unbowed, it is too big for my windshield. It utterly fills my field of view. I cannot avert my eyes or I will crash. I see its perspiring welded seams, the beaconed head, the oxidized iron bubbling through the paint. I see the veinous wires crawling up its neck. With spiked collars around its neck, it appears to be leaning over the roadway. Is it about to pounce? It will crush us all if it falls. In the fell clutch of circumstance! Black as the pit from pole to pole!&#8221;</em></p>

A prosperous 2010 to all our reader.</p>
<p>Our intrepid reporters had a chance to visit the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere and take some photos. We will file a report soon. In the mean time, here is a preview photo of a lovely day at the site.</p>
<p>The sky is clear and blue. The Kahwamee swamp is reedy and cold. The water tower looms over all, watching from behind the trees. This photo was taken on December 29th, 2009. The air temp was about 22 degrees and there were high gusty winds making the  wavelets on the water.</p>

					<p>The Portland Water Bureau has written a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.portlandonline.com/water/index.cfm?a=230938&amp;c=48483"> blog article</a> on this site. It is interesting to see various water companies and municipal water works tracking and linking to this site. Thanks to author Jennie Day-Burget of Blogtella for writing the nice article.</p>
<p>The Portland Water Bureau motto is &#8220;From Forest to Faucet&#8221;. The Union Township municipal water does not come from a forest. It comes from wells drilled into the Kahwamee swamp. It is pumped and processed in a local treatment plant and stored in the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere.</p>
<p>Perhaps Union residents can have a similar motto as well. &#8220;From Swamp to Sink&#8221; or &#8220;From Kahwamee to Kraphole&#8221; are two that come to mind. What are your ideas? Got any catchy subtitles for the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere water?</p>

					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/WTWSScientist320.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/WTWSScientist320-112x150.jpg" alt="WTWS Scientist" title="WTWS Scientist" width="112" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-233"/></a>Scientists at the <em>World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere Research Center</em> in Austin, Texas have determined the extent of damage possible to the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere in the event of massive flooding. As many people know, the level of the oceans is rising due to global warming and the melting of polar ice caps. As the ice caps melt, the coast recedes, the shore advances, and what was once land becomes submerged. Pretty soon the Watchung Mountains become prime beachfront property. Using NASA satellite data and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=40.6754,-74.2010&amp;z=4&amp;m=14">Firetree Google Maps</a>, one can analyze the effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/WTWSFlood320.gif"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/WTWSFlood320.gif" alt="WTWS Flood" title="WTWS Flood" width="320" height="243" class="alignright size-full wp-image-234"/></a><br/>
The animated map to the right shows the extent of flooding that might damage the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere. (Turn on browser images and animation to see the horrible consequences). To the left of the photo lies Kawameeh Park, site of the WTWS. To the center, lies Kean University, home of the Cougars (and they ain&#8217;t talking about cats, baby, yeah!) To the right lies  Newark Liberty Airport.</p>
<p>At 3 meters rise, most of the Newark Ironbound district and the airport is under water, signified by the blue shading to the right. At 6 meters, sea water has covered Weequahic Park and starts to enter downtown Elizabeth. Route 22 and 78 and the New Jersey Turnpike by the airport is open to boat traffic. At 9 meters Elizabeth goes under, and Kawameeh swamp floods into a lake. At 12 meters and then 14 meters, Kean University becomes beach front property. Thankfully, the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere appears to be safe at this level. Union residents will likely have an uninterrupted supply of clean drinking water, and toilets will continue to flush all but the biggest piles of excrement.</p>
<p>While we are talking scientifically here, the next research project for the <em>World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere Research Center</em> is why New Jerseyans say the <em>Jersey Shore</em> rather than the <em>Jersey Coast</em>. As any sea dog knows, the shore is the landward limit of the sea, and the coast is the seaward limit of the land. Unless most Jerseyans are expressing their love for the ocean and that strip of beach that exists between high and low tide (you know, the part that gets all the seaweed, sand dollars, and prehistoric horseshoe crabs), the New Jersey part with all the boardwalks, casinos, rides,  games, beer and pizza would be the Jersey coast.</p>

					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/0model800.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/0model800-99x150.jpg" alt="" title="WTWS and Trees" width="99" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-211"/></a>There are many artists that visit the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere site. They make beautiful photographs, computer images, and artwork and contribute it to the site for all the world to see. Most of us gaze in awe at the wonderful creations they make that inspire us and give us hope for humankind, just as did the original inception, development, and construction of the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere. Hooray for fresh clean drinking water at acceptable water pressure levels! Hooray for inspiring artists!</p>
<p>This article will teach other visitors how to create other similar artistic images. Click on any image for a larger view. By following the simple guidelines, perhaps printing off a few of the images as a staring point, everyone can create inspiring works of art based on the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere. Use this photo or any other photo from this site as a model. Or visit the WTWS in person and create a new image. Inspire others as you inspire yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/1shapes800.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/1shapes800-99x150.jpg" alt="" title="WTWS General Shape" width="99" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-212"/></a>To begin, grab some artistic tools. You will need some paper and pencils, fabric and ink pens, canvas and paints, paper and scissors, or other art media. For this exercise, I used paper and some color pencils I bought at the corner drug store.</p>
<p>The first step is to make a general outline shape of the WTWS. The top is sphere and likely will be the focal point of your drawing. Then draw the neck, a column leading from the sphere to the ground. The bottom of the WTWS has a conical support base. Underneath the top there is also a bit of a cone to support the crowning sphere. This drawing shows the beginning of my artwork.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/2color800.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/2color800-99x150.jpg" alt="" title="WTWS Coloring" width="99" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-213"/></a>The next step is to color in your water sphere with the basic colors. You can use authentic color schemes, try some new colors to propose to Union residents, or make any colors to free your mind. There are no right or wrong colors. The actual colors change with the seasons and the day to night lighting. Your perception of the colors change with your mood and your feelings. Feel free to experiment.</p>
<p>Consider where the light source is in your image. Since the WTWS is shiny, the side of the WTWS nearest the light probably is the lightest color. The side away from the light is probably the darkest color. Add shading colors to the dark side of the sphere. Here my drawing is slightly blue turquoise. I have also adding the proud Union lettering that announces to all the world the fine people who have conceived and built this inspiration.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3attachments800.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3attachments800-99x150.jpg" alt="" title="WTWS Attachments" width="99" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-214"/></a>Don&#8217;t forget the day-to-day function of the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere. Not only does it provide water, it also serves as a calling card for the Township of Union. It functions as a cell phone tower for millions of mobile phone calls per month. And it acts as a navigation point both in the day and, now with its new red beacon, during the darkest nightmare-filled nights. When you are afraid of the dark and the monsters that roam within your deepest dreams, the WTWS with its flashing beacon will be there.</p>
<p>Add some of the modern features to your WTWS image. This drawing now  contains the cell phone antennas, maintenance wires and doorways, and the red flashing top beacon. Also, since the beginning, the WTWS has had two upper neck halos. Some say these halos are for maintenance. Other say these broadcast the message that all Union residents must follow.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3background800.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3background800-99x150.jpg" alt="" title="WTWS Background" width="99" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-215"/></a>Now that you have the main WTWS image created, you can add some surrounding context. Start with some background and work your way forward. When considering the background, ask yourself some questions. Is it day or night? Do I see the sun or the moon, blue skies or a black velvet field of stars? Is it clear or cloudy and stormy with lightning?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the backdrop on the ground either. To the west are the Watchung mountains of New Jersey. To the east are the cityscapes of Union, Newark, and New York City. Being near Newark Liberty airport, there might be a few airplanes as well. Perhaps there are some nearby inferior water towers gazing up in awe or effluvial envy of the WTWS. For my drawing I made a sunny day with some cities and mountains in the background.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/4foreground800.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/4foreground800-99x150.jpg" alt="" title="WTWS Foreground" width="99" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-216"/></a>Now that a background is added, work your way forward and add some foreground. Remember all the rich details of the site of the WTWS. It sits in the Kahwamee swamp, so add a swamp and some cattails. It is surrounded by major roadways, so don&#8217;t forget Route 22, the Garden State Parkway, or Morris Avenue. Finally, add some grass and trees. Although many people have an image of New Jersey as an endless roadway, in reality it is a garden state, covered from end to end with grass, trees, and water ways, so don&#8217;t leave them out Consider which season you have in your image, and make the trees bare for winter, bright green for spring, dark green for summer, and fire-colored for autumn. Go crazy with the colors because the WTWS site changes with each passing day.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/5vistors800.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121233516im_/http://www.worldstallestwatersphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/5vistors800-99x150.jpg" alt="" title="WTWS Visitors" width="99" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-217"/></a>I would say our artwork is looking great, but as a finishing touch you can add all sorts of happy visitors to the WTWS. I remember when I was a child, a large zeppelin attempted to dock with the WTWS during a storm. There was also an episode of belligerent alien space craft who communicated with the WTWS and then left in a peaceful manner (and as a gift gave us large brown bubbles on our New Jersey thin-crust pizza). Also there are countless episode of cars crashing and planes doing aerial stunts around the WTWS. Perhaps you want to add your family or pets to the artwork. This is the time to let your imagination run wild and give your drawing a sense of personality.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;ve given you a bit of inspiration to make some WTWS artwork. Click on the images to get a larger view. Feel free to use any of these images as starting point or as a coloring book for the beginning artists. If you make any good artworks, please send them in, and we will feature them on the site. Good luck!</p>

(#32) has a nice article on the World&#8217;s Tallest Water Sphere.</p>
<p>Not only do they have wonderful color photos of the WTWS that you can carry conveniently on your next safari in Bostwana, you also get a colorful shot of the WTWS web master in full WTWS professor costume. It even has a glimpse of some of the fine models you can view when you visit the WTWS Museum in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>On sale at newsstands everywhere from now until October, 2009. Please patronize this fine magazine and the many wonderful New Jersey topics they cover.<br/>

      <b><font size="4"></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
      <p>In August 1607, approximately 100 English colonists landed near the
      mouth of the Kennebec River. Under the leadership of George Popham and
      Raleigh Gilbert, the men set about to build a fort, Fort St. George, and
      settle.</p>
      <p><a href="pohampic.html" target="pophampic.html"><img border="1" src="/web/20110704053256im_/http://www.mpbn.net/homestom/images/popsmall.jpg" align="left" alt="Popham Colony Plan" width="150" height="112"></a>The
      Popham Colony was the first organized attempt to establish an English
      settlement in New England. The effort was short-lived, however. Following
      the death of George Popham and the planned departure of Raleigh Gilbert,
      the colonists abandoned their effort and returned to England in the fall
      of 1608. Despite its failure as a permanent settlement, the Popham Colony
      provided an important English toehold in the New World and helped
      contribute to the success of the Plymouth Colony in 1620.</p>
      <p>Beginning in 1994, archaeologists began a systematic investigation of
      the Fort St. George site, which previously had not been located with
      certainty. This important archaeological research continues to the present
      day and has yielded remarkable evidence of the structures and objects that
      were a part of the English colonists' early, year-long stay on the
      present-day coast of Maine.</p>

      archaeological research on the site, visit the official Popham Colony

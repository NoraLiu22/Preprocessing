<a NAME="ha"></a>Harare city flag </h3>
<p>On the second anniversary of Zimbabwe's independence in April 1982,
Salisbury was renamed Harare and later adopted new municipal arms and a
flag. As in the case of its predecessor, the design of the flag once again
followed the adoption of the new municipal arms.
<p>The new municipal flag is an extension of the new shield in the proportion
1:2.&nbsp; Some license has been used as there are seven golden sun rays
on the shield of the arms but only six on the flag.&nbsp; On the flag these
are off-set as the <a href="zw.html#emb">Zimbabwe Bird</a> and tobacco leaves are placed on the centre
line.
<br><i>Bruce Berry</i>, 4 Dec 2000
<p>Description of the flag
<br>Five stripes as follows:
<br>First stripe: combination as sun rays (like the Macedonian flag) but blue
and yellow.
<br>Second stripe: plain yellow thinner stripe
<br>The central stripe is red with two yellow leafs in a symmetric layout.
<br>Four stripe: plain yellow thinner stripe
<br>Five stripe: plain blue with a yellow Zimbabwean bird in the center.
<p>You can find the inspiration of this flag in the Coat of Arms of Harare (see
below),
the traditional shield guarded by two sables (antelopes) is decorated in
the same way than the flag.
<br><i>Santiago Tazon</i>, 10 May 2001
<p>The new municipal flag is an extension of the new shield in the proportion
1:2.&nbsp; Some license has been used as there are seven golden sun rays
on the shield of the arms but only six on the flag.&nbsp; On the flag these
are off-set as the Zimbabwe Bird and tobacco leaves are placed on the centre
line. This armorial flag or heraldic banner, argues Michael Faul, provides
a good example of the pathological condition known as "dysproportionality"
which William Crampton referred to in his lecture at the XVI&nbsp; ICV
in Warsaw. <br>

by <i>Martin Grieve</i>, 27 Aug 2002<p>Following the decision of Cecil John Rhodes'
<a href="zw-bsac.html">British South Africa Company</a> (BSAC) to colonise the area now known as Zimbabwe,
the first group of White settlers arrived at Mount Hampden, about 12 miles
from where Fort Salisbury was eventually sited, with the Pioneer Column
on 12 September 1890.&nbsp; A Board of Management for the town was established
in 1891 and a municipality was established in 1897.&nbsp; Salisbury became
capital of Southern Rhodesia in 1923 and was made a city in 1935.<p>A flag was only chosen for the city after 1939 when the City Council,
by then aware that the municipal arms were not in accordance with heraldic
custom, again approached the College of Arms (London) and reached agreement
on a new design for the municipal arms.&nbsp;The new design retained the three
roundels with fleur-de-lis from the Cape Colony Arms and included a simple
charge to represent agriculture.&nbsp; The supporters were two Sable antelopes
and the lion in the crest was adopted from the Arms of Cecil John Rhodes.<p>The
blazon of the actual grant is as follows:<p>ARMS: Vert on a Fesse between three
Garbs Or as many Hurts each charged with a Fleur-de-lis of the second and for
the Crest on a wreath of the Colours: A demi lion Or gorged with a collar of the
last thereon three Hurts&nbsp; each charged with a Fleur-de-lis Gold.<br>
SUPPORTERS: On either side a Sable Antelope proper Gorged&nbsp; with a collar
Or pendant therefrom an Escutcheon Gules charged with a rifle&nbsp; and an Axe
in Saltire Gold.<br>
MOTTO: Discrimine Salus<p>
<a href="../images/z/zw)sby.jpg"><img border="0" src="../images/z/zw)sby.jpg" width="229" height="217"></a> scan by
<i>Bruce Berry</i>, 10 Oct 2006<p>The motto can be translated as &quot;In Discrimination
is Safety&quot; and was not, as has been occasionally suggested, a reference to
discrimination between the races, but was originally the motto of the Traill
family from whom William Fairbridge, an early mayor, was descended and was
chosen as a reference to the careful choice of the site for the city.
<p>The approach followed with
regard to the municipal flag, as is the case in many British and American examples
of municipal vexillology, was simply to place the shield from these
municipal arms in the centre of a plain white field.<br>
<br>
Salisbury was renamed Harare on the second anniversary of Zimbabwe's
independence on 18 April 1982.

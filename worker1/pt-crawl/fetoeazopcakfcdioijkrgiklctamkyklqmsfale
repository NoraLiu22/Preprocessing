<p>This flag was the flag of the &Aacute;rp&aacute;d House, the House of the
first Hungarian kings. It based on a picture on a stamp from
1981. The title is: Flag of the &Aacute;rp&aacute;d House in the 11th
century.<br>
The first known member of the &Aacute;rp&aacute;ds was Prince &Uuml;gyek. His
son, &Aacute;lmos and &Aacute;lmos's son &Aacute;rp&aacute;d werethe leaders of the
Hungarians at the time of the Hungarian Conquest in the

<p>Yesterday I was in the Hungarian Institute &amp; Museum of
Military History and I got 16 picture from Mrs. Cs&aacute;kv&aacute;ri,
Gy&ouml;rgyi Kottra counsellor, chief museologist and head of
collection at the Military History Institute and Museum of the
Hungarian Army.<br>
Original comment for the flag<br>
&quot;1 -2. Family and royal banner of the House of &Aacute;rp&aacute;d
(reconstruction). The two flags were reconstructed on the basis
of portrayals of the period. They follow the pattern of medieval
banners, the heraldic, rectangular flags. The textile parts
substitute for the escutcheons. The earlier one with the
patriarchal cross appeared during the reign of B&eacute;la III. As his
coat-of arms the king had chosen the patriarchal cross of
Byzantine origin, which was placed on the red escutcheon of the
&Aacute;rp&aacute;ds. The triple mound under the cross appeared later. The
red-argent striped flag appeared during the reign of B&eacute;la's
sons, Imre and Andr&aacute;s II, as a revival of the coats-of arms of
the previous kings. The flags and coats-of arms were used
parallel to each other throughout the Middle Ages by kings from
the House of &Aacute;rp&aacute;d and other dynasties in Hungary, as well. The
two coats-of arms have made up today's Hungarian national arms,
their colours are today's national colours.&quot;<br>

<p>The 36th flag mentioned and illustrated in the Book of All
Kingdoms [<a href="bib-f0a.html#f0fXX">e9s50</a>] is attributed to
Hungary (<em>Ungr&iacute;a</em>). This as depicted in the 2005 spanish
illustrated transcription [<a href="bib-f0a.html#f0f05">e9s05</a>],
a horizontally divided flag, the upper half blue semy of yellow
flaurs de lis and the bottom half filled with seven horizontal
stripes, alternating red and white, the latter thinner; flag in
the ogival default shape of this source.<br>
The anonymous author of [<a href="bib-f0a.html#f0fXX">e9s50</a>]
describes the flag thusly: &quot;E las se&#x0144;ales deste reinado es
un pend&oacute;n a meitades, la una meitat con flores de Francia porque
es el rey de la Casa de Francia, e la otra meitad vandas bermejas
e blancas d&#146;esta manera&quot; (And the sign of this kingdom
is a halved pendon, one half with flowers of France because the
kingf os of the house of France, and the other half red and white
bars like this.). &nbsp; <br>
This is the same design as the one above for Anjou Kings, only
differently depicted probably due to style contraints on the part
of the author of [<a href="bib-f0a.html#f0fXX">e9s50</a>].<br>

<p>On this Turkish picture from the 15-16th century you can see a
yellow-blue flag. On the picture there is the Great Victory at
Belgrade (N&aacute;ndorfeh&eacute;rv&aacute;r) in 1456. See &lt;<a

<p>This is a picture whose photo was sent by me two years ago
from the original at Topkapi Saray in Istanbul. &#142;eljko
suggested that it is how the artist thought a Christian flag
looks like but not a real flag that was viewed by him.<br>
<em>Dov Gutterman</em>, 13 Febuary 2001</p>

<p>Maybe this flag relates to the flag (?) of J&aacute;nos Hunyadi,
regent of Hungary. <a
href="http://www.magyarmult.externet.hu/Hunyadiak/Kepek/fokep.jpg">Here</a>
is his Coat of Arms: Two fields are blue with black crow, two
fields are white with red lion. <br>
<em>Istv&aacute;n Moln&aacute;r</em>, 13 Febuary 2001</p>

<p>I think this flag is on the walls of Belgrade in 1456: &lt;<a
href="http://www.geocities.com/zaszlok/hazateres/zaszlok/hu-hunya.jpg">www.geocities.com/zaszlok</a>&gt;.
This is the flag of J&aacute;nos (Johannes) Hunyadi, regent of Hungary.<br>
<em>Istv&aacute;n Moln&aacute;r</em>, 13 Febuary 2001</p>

<p>Here is the story of the Great Victory of J&aacute;nos Hunyadi in
1456 - &lt;<a href="http://www.thehistorynet.com/MilitaryHistory/articles/08965_text.htm">www.thehistorynet.com</a>&gt;.<br>
<em>Istv&aacute;n Moln&aacute;r</em>, 27 Febuary 2001</p>

<p>A <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Siege_of_N%C3%A1ndorfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r.jpg">flag</a> is visible in a 1584 Turkish miniature depicting the unsucessful 1456 Ottoman siege of Belgrade, pitting Hungarian nobleman John Hunyadi against 
sultan Mehmet the Conqueror.<br>
The flag is quartered yellow-blue, with a wide red cross separating the quarters and a the upper fly quarter extending as a &quot;tail.&quot; Some Ottoman cavalry flags 
are also shown (in the lower right), but not clearly.<br>
<i>Eugene Ipavec</i>, 9 July 2010</p>
<p>John Hunyadi aka Hunyadi J&aacute;nos in Hungarian and Sibinjanin Janko in Serbian, 
his Latin name Ioannes Corvinus (also having variant names in other languages, 
according to the custom of the period) shows clear link with the great Hungarian 
ruling family of Corvins (he was father of the famous king Mathias Corvin).<br>
This may simply be a variation or simplified depiction of the banner of arms of 
Hunyadi - quartered azure a raven sable holding a golden ring in its beak and or 
a lion rampant gules holding a crown or - i.e. quartered Hunyadi and Beszterce (German 
Bistritz, archaic N&ouml;sen, now Bistri&#x0163;a in Romania). In this case, the red cross 
may be &quot;invention&quot; of the Ottoman artist (or not?), but in any case, the 
swenkeled flag were apparently common in this era. <br>
<i>&#142;eljko Heimer</i>, 9 July 2010

<p>According to this contemporary <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HunedorIoan1453.jpg">
depiction</a>, Huniady had quartered 1 and 4 azure, a raven sable holding a ring or in its beak, 2 and 3 
AZURE, a lion rampant gules, holding a crown (or?) in its left paw. Note, though, 
the border and separating lines or, and the lambrequins azure and or.&nbsp; <br>
I don't know what credibility can we assign to a miniature painted more than a 
century later. <br>
<i>Alex Danes</i>, 9 July 2010

<p>It's not so much credibility as it is a matter of historical interest... I 
wonder if there are any depictions of the siege from the other side? Being a 
Christan victory, there ought to heve been some gloating paintings.<br>

<p>The flag of the Black Army. The Black Army was the centre of
the mercenary force of King Mathias I. <br>
From &lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/zaszlok/Muzeum/">www.geocities.com/zaszlok/Muzeum</a>&gt;:
&quot;5. The so-called `Black Army' banner, reconstruction This
characteristic flag with a forked tail was reconstructed after a
miniature in Philostratus Chronicle, one of the Corvinas,
representing the 1485 entry of Corvin J&aacute;nos, son of king
Matthew, into Vienna. The black colour of the flag used to be
white (argent) in fact, but the argent paint had become oxidised.
The reconstruction preserves the original colour.&quot;<br>
I made two images. The traditional (black) and the original
(white (?)).<br>
<em>Istv&aacute;n Moln&aacute;r</em>, 19 June 2001</p>

<p>Shouldn't the bird in the heart shield be white also in the
second flag? This would be more in accordance with the heraldic
tincture rule. The fields represent Hungary (1 and 4) and Bohemia
(2 and 3).<br>
<em>Elias Granqvist</em>, 20 June 2001</p>

<p>The heart shield is the Coat of Arms of the Hunyadi Family. On
the blue field there is the black crow on its mouth there is a
silver ring. <br>
<em>Istv&aacute;n Moln&aacute;r</em>, 20 June 2001</p>

<p>There is another reason why the bird remains black.&nbsp; As
Istvan said, it is the shield of the Hunyadi family, whose
members included one Governor of Hungary, one Regent of Hungary,
one Ban (Landowner/Lord type rank) of Transylvania, and one King
of Hungary.&nbsp; The bird on the shield is a raven, after a
story that the young Janos (John) Hunyadi was comissioned by his
mother, Erzsebet (Elizabeth) Szilagyi, to take a ring to the
then-King of Hungary and Holy Roman Emperor, Zsigmond (Sigismund)
of Luxembourg.&nbsp; She had been given this ring by him, during
one of his hunting trips in the are where she resided.&nbsp; On
the way to the royal court, young Hunyadi and a servant stopped,
andf he started napping.&nbsp; He was soon woken up by his
servant, being told that the ring had been taken by a crow, and
she was flying away with it in her bill.&nbsp; Hunyadi killed the
crow with his last arrow, and when he was given a coat of arms,
he chose to have a raven with a ring in its bill as his emblem.
Another small fact about this Coat of Arms:&nbsp; The Hunyadi
family's name in Latin is &quot;Corvinus&quot;, meaning
&quot;crow&quot;, or &quot;raven&quot;.&nbsp; And King Matthias'
library, where the book covers all had the shield on them, was
known as the Corvina Library, second only to the Pope's.&nbsp; It
is also the name of one of the foremost publishing houses in
Hungary today.<br>
<em>Georges G. Kovari</em>, 22 June 2001</p>

<p>J&aacute;nos (John) Hunyadi (1406 - 23 October 1456), Ban (governor)
of Transylvania 1441-1446. Regent of Hungary 1446-1453<br>
M&aacute;ty&aacute;s (Mathias) Hunyadi (23 Febuary 1440 - 6 April 1490), King
of Hungary (1458-1490). Other name Mathias Corvinus.<br>
Erzs&eacute;bet Szil&aacute;gyi was the wife of J&aacute;nos Hunyadi and she was
the mother of King Mathias. No data about J&aacute;nos Hunyadi's
mother. By a legend his mother was Erzs&eacute;bet Morzsinai a daughter
of a Walachian voevod (ken&eacute;z!) and his father was King Sigismund
(king of Hungary 1387-1438). The fact: Vajk, a Walachian noble,
royal warrior got the tenure and castle of Hunyad in 1409, when
J&aacute;nos was 3 years old. Vajk of Hunyad (he had got the family
name about the castle) had got another son. This boy was named
J&aacute;nos too (!!!!) You can see the tomb of the two brother (the
two J&aacute;nos Hunyadi) in the Roman Catholic cathedral of Alba Iulia
city (Alba county, Romania; its Hungarian name: Gyulafeh&eacute;rv&aacute;r).
The young J&aacute;nos Hunyadi became one of the richest lords of
Hungary. His fantastic castle you can see in Hunedoara city
(Hunedoara county, Romania; its Hungarian name: originally
Hunyadv&aacute;r - from the 15th century Vajdahunyad)<br>
The legend of the ring, crow etc. - The crow holding a ring in
its mouth is in a legend about the descend of Hunyadi J&aacute;nos
(John of Hunyad), father of King Mathias, governor of Hungary,
the victorious hero of the siege of N&aacute;ndorfeh&eacute;rv&aacute;r (Belgrade)
in 1456. By the legend his father, King Sigismund, King of
Hungary, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Germany) fell in love
with a young Transylvanian (Walachian) girl. To remember this
love the king gave a ring to the girl. The girl, who was the
daughter of a Transylvanian Boyar bore a boy. When the little
child, Jankula played on the yard of the House of the Morzsinai
Family a crow stole the ring. The mother of Jankula was
frightened and his brother shot the crow. The girl went to the
king to remind him of their love and to show him their child. The
king took upon himself to bring up the young boy. After a month
the king gave a Coat of Arms to the Morzsinai Family (a crow
holding a ring in its mouth) and a great tenure in Transylvania,
in Hunyad. The boy lived in the Castle of Hunyad and was given
him the name: Hunyadi.<br>
This is a short reconstruction of the legend...<br>
<em>Istv&aacute;n Moln&aacute;r</em>, 22 June 2001</p>

<p>I do not want to look like a conceited person, but let me tell
my own family history on my maternal side. By mother's maiden
name is Marussy, and there is a family tradition that Marussy is
a Hungarized version of the Cumanian name Morzsinai, and that we
are descendants of the brother of Morzsinai Erzsebet, so we have
a blood relationship connection to the Hunyadi family. Our family
tradition also say that the Morzsianai/Marussy clan is not of
Vlachian origin, but of Cumanian origin. They came to Hungary
from Moldva in the 14th century. The original letter of nobility
dated from the 17th century is in the posession of my mother's
cousin, it says &quot;it is issued to certify that Marussy Andras
is already a noble&quot;. The nobility prename of the family is
fehervari (de Alba Iulia), so there is a big coincidence. Of
course there is no proof for this, maybe the family tradition is

<p>In the 15th century the word Walachian didn't means Walachian
ethnicity but origin from Walachia (now southern part of
Romania). Before the Mongol Invasion the territory was under
Cumanian rule. It could be the nobles were Cumanians by origin in
the 15th century...<br>

<p>Nicholaus Zr&iacute;nyi (1620-1664), In Hungarian: Zr&iacute;nyi Mikl&oacute;s,
Hungarian lord, general, Hungarian poet. In Croatian: Nicola
Zrinski, Croatian-Hungarian lord, general, Croatian poet In Latin
(the official language of the Kingdom of Hungary): Nicolaus a
Zrini, The family has got its family name from the Castle of
Zrin(y). Their original name was Subi&#x010d;. Nicholaus Zr&iacute;nyi wrote
the famous Hungarian epic: &quot;A szigeti veszedelem&quot; about
his great-grandfather, Nicholaus Zr&iacute;nyi's battle at Szigetv&aacute;r
1566. From a Croatian page about the Zr&iacute;nyi - Zrinski family -
(flag is&nbsp; &quot;Nicola VII&quot;s flag) at &lt;<a
href="http://www.hr/darko/etf/subich.html">www.hr</a>&gt;:
&quot;...Nikola VII, like his father, before him, was famous for
his heroism and education. The Franciscans in Cakovec owe him
special gratitude since he was the man who established the
Franciscan order in Cakovec. There is still a portrait of Juraj
[gyo'rgy] at the Franciscan monastery with a Latin inscription in
its upper corner: &quot;Com. Nicolaus a Zrinio Regn. Dalm. Croat.
Et Slav- Banus ac PP Franciscanorum Prov. S. Ladislai Chaktorn,
introductor et illocator Ao 1659&quot; (Prince Nikola Sdrinia,
the Viceroy of Dalmatian, Croatian and Slavonian Kingdom, the man
who introduced the Franciscan fathers of St. Ladislav's province
to Cakovec in 1659). Due to his heroic acts (the Turks were
scared away from Kanjiza forever; the Drava bridge at Osijek was
burnt down) he became a Viceroy of Croatia and was respected and
appreciated throughout Europe. Nikola was also famous as a poet
and a polyglot - he spoke seven languages; in 1651, he wrote
&quot;Adriai Tengernek Syrenaia&quot; (Adriatic Sea Murmaid) in
Hungarian. Besides other poems, it contains the heroic epics on
the battle of Siget and Nikola of Siget's death. After the peace
treaty at Vasvar was concluded, he became the central figure of
the Zrinski - Frankopan plot, but not for long, since he was
killed by a wounded boar (?) while hunting at Kursanecki Lug on
the 18th November 1664. &quot;<br>

The flag is an old flag, maybe from the years of the Prince

this picture. At the time of the war such flags were used.<br>
Prince Francis R&aacute;k&oacute;czi II was the Reigning Prince of
Transylvania and the &quot;Commanding Prince&quot; of Hungary,
who was the leader the Anti-Habsburgian Independence war
1703-1711 in Hungary. It could be used between in this era.
&quot;CUM DEO PRO PATRIA ET LIBERTATE&quot; was the inscription
on the flags at the time of Prince R&aacute;k&oacute;czi's War of

<em>Istv&aacute;n Moln&aacute;r</em>, 8 June 2001</p>

<p>These coronation flags, as they are called, were used only on
coronation ceremonies in Bratislava, and thogh they are an
important relict showing the Croatian statehood continuity there
seems to be quite little resarched. However, two of such are
preserved in Croatian Historical Museum, one from 1830 and an
other from 1867. There is a short article obout those flags in
the exhibition catalogue of the flag exhibition held in the
museum few years ago. Even if the article is very much
concentrated to Croatian flags only, it may give few hints on
their use and history. There are also few references to some
Slovakian sources. They may then give us more info, and I don't
doubt that there is also extensive Hungarian literature about the
coronations that would encompass flags, too. I would guess that
some more examples of those flags are preserved in museums of
Hungary and slovakia (and more somewhere else?).<br>
<em>&#142;eljko Heimer</em>, 9 June 2001</p>

<p>I have contacted Mrs. Jelena Borosak-Marjanovic from Croatian
Historical Museum (cf. [<a href="bib-boa.html#bor96">bor96</a>])
regarding the big difference in design of the coronations flags
that are preserved in CHM and those displayed in St. Mathias
church in Budapest. As I have suggested this may be due (among
other possibilities) that those in St. Mathias church are not the
coronation flags from the event, but might be replicas made at
some latter point. Mrs. Borosak-Marjanovic is inclined to agree
with that assumption, and suggest that this might happened while
the church was renovated in 1874-1896.<br>
<em>&#142;eljko Heimer</em>, 19 June 2001</p>

<p>It seems that &#142;eljko is right. The facts are I
have got a picture: &quot;Historical flags on the Mathias
Church.&quot; and I have got an information from the church:
&quot;On the church there are only coronation flags from
1867&quot;<br>

<i>Istv&aacute;n Moln&aacute;r</i>,&nbsp; 08 April 2013</p>
<p>I've been looking through their pages, but it seems that the English version 
hardly mentions the flag, the german version has a bit, but I can really not 
found them more then you provided... Are there any images of the 1647 flags? 
(From what you wrote, it seems that I shall have to drive there to see them.
If anyone gets something more on the two 1647 mentioned, let me know . <br>
On coronation flags (including these 1618), see
<a href="hr_coro.html">this page</a>. <br>
Eventually - we should end up with the list of where all those flags from 
various coronation ceremonies are nowadays (if preserved). It seems obvious that 
the flags were as a rule kept by those who carried them in the ceremony, so they 
either ended up in their family collections or found their way to museums... or 
got lost in time...<br>

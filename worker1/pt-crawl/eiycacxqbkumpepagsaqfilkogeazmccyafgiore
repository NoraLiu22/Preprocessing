                              <p>
 When seven Westminster MPs, all Orangemen, met in January 1886 in the
 midst of the Home Rule crisis to form what eventually became the
 Unionist Party, they set the stage for the relationship between the
 Order and the Party thereafter. The Order sought to have a direct and
 crucial influence on political decisions, an objective which was fully
 realised when Ireland was partitioned twenty five years later. &lsquo;The
 marriage between the Unionist Party and the Orange Institution&rsquo; meant
 that &lsquo;the Order became a central organisational link in the unionist
 political machine&rsquo; in the new Northern Ireland statelet.
</p>
 
<p>
 Each of the six Stormont Prime Ministers between 1921 and 1972 were
 Orangemen, as were all but three Cabinet Ministers between 1921 and
 1969. Three Orange ministers later left the Order, one because his
 daughter married a Catholic, one to become Minister of Community
 Relations in 1970; the third was expelled for attending a Catholic
 religious ceremony. Of the 95 Stormont MPs who did not become Cabinet
 Ministers, 87 were Orangemen. Every Unionist Senator between 1921 and
 1969 - with one exception - was an Orangeman . One of these senators,
 James Gyle, was suspended from the Order for seven years for visiting
 nationalist MP Joe Devlin on his deathbed, showing, as Farrell puts it
 &lsquo;even in death the Unionists were ungenerous&rsquo;.
</p>
 
<p>
 Orangemen in power used public office to make Orange exclusivism a
 central doctrine in state policy. Thus, Basil Brooke, then Minister of
 Agriculture and later Prime Minister, stated in Derry in March 1934: &ldquo;
 I recommend those people who are loyalists not to employ Roman
 Catholics, 99 per cent of whom are disloyal&rdquo; . And in April 1934, the
 Prime Minister himself, Lord Craigavon, backed this up in the most
 infamous of the sectarian statements of the era: &ldquo;I have always said
 that I am an Orangeman first and a politician and a member of this
 parliament afterwards ... All I boast is that we have a Protestant
 parliament and a Protestant state&rdquo; . Although the rougher edges of this
 sectarianism were smoothed somewhat in time, even in the liberal 1960s,
 the same exclusivism came through in the sentiments of a later Prime
 Minister, Terence O&rsquo;Neill, in May 1969: &ldquo;If you treat Roman Catholics
 with due consideration and kindness, they will live like Protestants,
 in spite of the authoritative nature of their church&rdquo; . Terence O&rsquo;
 Neill, himself a member of the Orange Order, Apprentice Boys of Derry
 and Royal Black Institution, divided unionist and Orange opinion.
 Hostility by some brethren to O&rsquo;Neills reforms reached such a stage
 that George Forrest, the Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster was dragged off the
 platform during the Twelfth rally in Coagh, Co Tyrone in 1967 and
 kicked unconscious.
</p>
 
<p>
 The vanguard of the Order in government and in Stormont was backed up
 by a huge and influential army of foot soldiers in the wider society.
 Probert  estimates that in 1969 there were between 125,000 and 130,000
 members of the Order. Even the shake up of unionism in the 1970s did
 not decimate the Order. There were still an estimated 80,000 to 100,000
 members in 1980, 4,000 - 5,000 of whom were still in the South. The
 percentage of RUC members who were also members of the Order is
 unknown, but the B-Specials were almost exclusively Orangemen.
</p>
 
<p>
 Such an organisation, reaching from workers, through the security
 industry and up to the top ranks of the government was a powerful
 political force. Although there were frequently severe tactical
 differences between different groups, the strength of unionism in the
 Stormont years was the ability to hold together as a strategically
 focused power bloc. The apparent enigma was that unionism united
 factory owners and those they employed and exploited, that &ldquo;all the
 unionist leaders were members of a &ldquo;squirearchy&rdquo; leading a party which
 was predominantly working class&rdquo; . The mechanism which held this
 together, the explanation of the enigma, was the Orange Order.
</p>
 
<p>
 The Orange Order was not content to be merely a powerful force behind
 the scenes of politics and industry. There was also its public face,
 most apparent during the annual marches. Had those marches been
 confined to unionist areas it could easily be concluded that they were
 nothing more than folk festivals, the unionist community&rsquo;s equivalent
 of Mardi Gras. But a key component of the annual marching was the
 objective of &lsquo;flying the flag in enemy territory&rsquo;. Miller  concludes
 that &ldquo;Orange parades can only take place either on the sufferance of
 the local Catholics or by virtue of an overwhelming show of force by
 the authorities&rdquo;. This was apparent through the five decades of
 Unionist Party monopoly rule.
</p>
 
<p>
 In 1935 the worst violence since the foundation of the statelet
 occurred, leaving nine people dead and 514 Catholic families,
 comprising 2,241 people, intimidated out of Protestant areas. The
 violence began on the Twelfth of July when the annual Orange march was
 returning from the Field (then in East Belfast) and invaded the small
 Catholic enclave of Lancaster Street, off York Street. For its part,
 the Orange Order blamed the violence on &lsquo;that portion of the populace
 which ever arrays itself on the side of sedition and disloyalty&rsquo;.
</p>
 
<p>
 In the 1950s, the Longstone Road area near Annalong, County Down became
 the Drumcree of its day. In June 1952, Orangemen from Annalong went out
 of their way to march through the nationalist Longstone Road, which was
 not a traditional route. The march was banned by Stormont. The ensuing
 uproar from Orangemen and Unionists persuaded the Stormont government
 to back down and allow another Orange march through the area on July 3,
 1952. But the route was blocked by local nationalists and the RUC did
 not have enough personnel to force the march through. Further parades
 in ensuing years were banned, but in 1955 permission was given for a
 Twelfth parade. 12,000 Orangemen, led by local Unionist MP Brian
 Faulkner, paraded twice along the road protected by 300 RUC men, many
 in riot gear. The following year a pitched battle ensued with an Orange
 march on Easter Monday. Locals blocked the road with boulders and farm
 machinery, but the RUC forced the march through eventually. At Easter
 1958, 300 RUC men again forced a march through. Although the local
 nationalists suffered as a result of this annual invasion, not everyone
 was so unfortunate. Faulkner, like Trimble 40 years later, enhanced his
 public profile as a staunch unionist, a fact that led to his rapid rise
 in the party.
</p>
 
<p>
 In 1968, two weeks before the Twelfth, Dungiven Orangemen marched
 without incident through the town to unveil their new banner. Two weeks
 later, nationalists blocked the local lodge as it marched en route to
 the Twelfth celebrations in Limavady. Many of the demonstrators were
 arrested. There was minor vandalism against the local Orange hall. So,
 next day, B Specials were sent to guard the hall; the District
 Commander of the B Specials also happened to be the Master of the
 Dungiven Orange Lodge whose march initially sparked off the trouble.
 That evening, the police baton charged a crowd of nationalists leaving
 a dance, killing 66 year old Francis McCloskey . An Orange march was
 the trigger for one of the first deaths of the current &lsquo;troubles&rsquo;.
</p>
 
<p>
 When a civil rights march was announced for Derry on the 5th of October
 1968 the Minister of Home Affairs at the time, William Craig, used the
 excuse of an alleged Apprentice Boys parade to ban both marches, a
 favourite tactic before and since.
</p>
 
<p>
 One year on and the Apprentice Boys parade in Derry in August 1969
 sparked off the Battle of the Bogside which was to eventually lead to
 the introduction of British troops following the most serious rioting
 in almost 50 years in Derry, Belfast and elsewhere in the North. The
 August parades were subsequently banned in 1970 and 1971. In 1972 the
 Apprentice Boys abandoned their attempt to parade across the bridge
 which had been blocked by British soldiers. A rally was held in the
 Waterside and addressed by the Rev. Ian Paisley.
</p>
 
<p>
 The myth exists in some quarters that there was a &lsquo;golden age&rsquo; in the
 1950s and the 1960s when Orange marches were just fun, when even
 nationalists went to watch and when no nationalist had any objection to
 marches in their areas. That myth does not match the reality.
</p>
 
 
<b><p>
 Direct Rule and the Orders
</p></b>
 
<p>
 The explicitly political role of the Loyal Orders did not end with the
 demise of the &lsquo;Orange State&rsquo;. To this day they continue to influence
 unionist politics both at the centre and the extremes.
</p>
 
<p>
 With the abolition of the Stormont parliament in 1972 and direct rule
 imposed from London, the monolith that was Ulster Unionism fragmented.
 Since the late sixties power was no longer in the hands of a single
 united Unionist Party. The role of the Order, as always in times of
 crisis, was to unite unionism and oppose concessions to nationalists.
 Months before the demise of Stormont the Scottish Grand Secretary, John
 Adam, trawled Orange lodges in Scotland looking for volunteers with
 military experience to &ldquo;go to Ulster to fight&rdquo;. Thousands are alleged
 to have &lsquo;answered the call&rsquo; though the UVF said &ldquo;it did not yet need
 them&rdquo;. In a speech to the Oxford Union the Grand Master of the Order,
 Martin Smyth MP, compared the loss of Stormont to &ldquo;the people of Prague
 when they wakened one morning to find Russian tanks on their streets&rdquo;.
 (Did he subconsciously equate the Irish with the Czechs and the British
 with the Russians ?) He went on suggest to that Direct Rule was not
 regarded as &ldquo;lawful government&rdquo; in an ominous warning of things to
 come.
</p>
 
<p>
 Meanwhile the Orange Order continued to parade. In June 1972, while a
 fragile cease-fire disintegrated during a confrontation in the Lenadoon
 area of Belfast, word came through that the British Army had forced an
 Orange parade through the Catholic Tunnel area of Portadown . The news
 was seen as further evidence of a breach of the cease-fire. The
 rerouting controversy was not limited to the Portadown area. Guelke
 notes that for nationalists &ldquo;conflicts with the British Army over such
 sensitive issues as the routes of Orange Order marches provided an
 additional source of alienation from the British authorities&rdquo;.
</p>
 
<p>
 The first attempt by Downing St to hand some degree of power back to
 political parties in the North came with the publication of a White
 paper on a proposed new power sharing agreement between Unionists and
 the nationalist SDLP which was to include an &lsquo;Irish dimension&rsquo;. The
 intention was to isolate the IRA. The Orange Order rejected the White
 Paper out of hand . On December 3 1973 the Orange Order organised a
 meeting at the Ulster Hall together with the semi-fascist Vanguard
 movement, led by William Craig, (and whose deputy leader was David
 Trimble). Also present was Ian Paisley&rsquo;s Democratic Unionist Party and
 the anti-power sharing faction of the Ulster Unionist Party . The loose
 right-wing alliance which emerged, the United Ulster Unionist Council
 (UUUC), went on to play a major role in the defeat of the 1974 power
 sharing executive. Staying with the eastern European theme the official
 organ of the Orange Order, the Orange Standard, called the power
 sharing experiment (Sunningdale) &ldquo;the first Western example of Iron
 Curtain treatment of a satellite&rdquo;. In order to co-ordinate opposition
 the UUUC went on to join a larger pan-Unionist front including at least
 seven loyalist paramilitary groups . A strike by loyalist workers,
 accompanied by widespread intimidation and a sectarian murder campaign,
 saw the British government accede to loyalist demands and the
 experiment was abandoned. The British Army had again refused to move
 against loyalists. At the height of the strike, the Portadown UVF, in
 collusion with the British security service MI5 which was attempting to
 destabilise the Wilson Government, planted no-warning bombs in Dublin
 and Monaghan. Thirty three people died. One of the strike
 co-ordinators, Sammy Smyth, said, &ldquo;I am very happy about the bombings
 in Dublin&rdquo;.
</p>
 
<p>
 In September 1975 the Vanguard leader, William Craig, proposed a
 &lsquo;voluntary coalition&rsquo; to run the North. The UUUC, including the Order,
 rejected the proposal. Soon after Craig was expelled from the UUUC. At
 the beginning of the month four Orangemen were murdered when a group
 calling itself the South Armagh Republican Action Force enter an Orange
 hall in Newtonhamilton and opened fire.
</p>
 
<p>
 In the mid-seventies the Apprentice Boys of Derry decided to withdraw
 from the Ulster Unionist Party where they had been represented on the
 Ulster Unionist Council since 1911. The breaking of the link with
 Official Unionism was not however the result of any &lsquo;depoliticisation&rsquo;
 within the organisation. The move was prompted by the growth in
 influence of the Democratic Unionist Party and the resultant need to
 accommodate the broader &lsquo;unionist family&rsquo; within the Apprentice Boys.
</p>
 
<p>
 The 1975 Twelfth Orange parade through the Catholic Obins St and
 Garvaghy Rd in Portadown takes place after the area is placed under de
 facto curfew by the security forces. The unionist orientated Portadown
 News commented, &ldquo;A visitor to the town could have been excused if he
 had been under the impression that a fair proportion of the British
 Army stationed in Ulster had been drafted into the town, and an equally
 large proportion of strength of the RUC&rdquo; .
</p>
 
<p>
 Meanwhile loyalist paramilitaries again attempted to flex their muscles
 in a political strike, in 1977. Though supported by Paisley the strike
 was criticised by the Order and the Ulster Unionists. The strike action
 failed to win widespread support and collapsed.
</p>
 
<p>
 The &lsquo;unionist family&rsquo; was to remain divided. The Order continued to
 call for a &lsquo;crackdown&rsquo; on the IRA and a return to &lsquo;majority&rsquo; (Unionist)
 rule. Not all emergency measures taken against the IRA were to meet
 with the Order&rsquo;s approval however. The Exclusion Orders by which entry
 to Britain could be denied prompted the Orange Standard to comment
 &ldquo;Soon the British Ulsterman may find himself as persecuted as the
 German Jew in the early days of Hitler, through the existence of
 offensive legislation such as the Exclusion Order...&rdquo; . There was one
 person however whom the Orange Order did wish to have excluded. When it
 was announced that the Pope was to visit Ireland in 1979 the Order
 joined Paisley in warning the &lsquo;anti-Christ&rsquo; that he was not welcome
 North of the border .
</p>
 
<p>
 Portadown again became the centre of attention in 1981 when residents
 attempted a sit-down protest to stop the Drumcree Orange parade. The
 RUC, having batoned residents off the road, allowed the parade which
 included the two Unionist MPs, Harold Mc Cusker and Martin Smyth, Grand
 Master of the Orange Lodge of Ireland. One of the &lsquo;walking brethren&rsquo;
 was George Seawright, the controversial DUP politician who later called
 for Catholics to be &ldquo;incinerated&rdquo; and was himself assassinated by the
 IPLO, a splinter republican group.
</p>
 
<p>
 In 1983 the Irish Government sets up the New Ireland Forum in a renewed
 attempt to isolate republicans and bolster the electoral fortunes of
 the SDLP . When the report of the Forum was subsequently published the
 Orange Order added its voice to the chorus of unionist condemnation
 with resolutions being passed at Twelfth parades throughout the North .
</p>
 
<p>
 The Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 saw a closing of the Unionist ranks,
 again in opposition. The Agreement set up a joint Secretariat at
 Maryfield in Belfast allowing the Irish Government an &lsquo;advisory role&rsquo;
 in decision making, a move which infuriated unionists. Against a
 background of rioting and attacks on the RUC the Order concluded that
 &ldquo;the Agreement and those who signed it have many sins to answer for&rdquo;.
 One of the &lsquo;sins&rsquo; that had to be answered for was the rerouting of
 Orange parades away from nationalist areas of Portadown, sparking
 rioting between Orangemen and the RUC in 1985 and again in 1986. The
 banning of an Apprentice Boys parade in March 1986 in Portadown &ldquo;leads
 to furious clashes between the RUC and loyalists..&rdquo; During the clashes
 Keith White became the first Protestant to be killed by a plastic
 bullet . The homes of over 500 RUC members in loyalist areas were
 attacked in the controversy surrounding the Anglo-Irish Agreement and
 the rerouting of parades. A former SDLP mayor of Derry, Joe Fegan,
 called for the annual Apprentice Boys parade to be banned . In a later
 fraternal message from the Grand Master of the Orange Lodge, Martin
 Smyth MP, to the Apprentice Boys of Derry, Smyth reminded the faithful
 that &ldquo;we still resist the false claims of Popery and throw off the
 shackles of the Anglo Irish Diktat&rdquo;.  while a Deputy Imperial Chaplain
 of the Orange Order, the Rev Robert Coulter, compared the Agreement to
 that obtained by Chamberlain at Munich and warned, &ldquo;the betrayal of
 Chamberlain led to a blood bath and Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s treachery could
 introduce to N.I. and Eire one of the greatest blood baths in their
 histories&rdquo;.
</p>
 
<p>
 At the December &lsquo;Shutting of the Gates&rsquo; ceremony the General Secretary
 of the Apprentice Boys puts the high attendance down to &ldquo; the feeling
 of opposition to the [Anglo-Irish] Agreement and the celebrations are
 being used as one way of making ... [that] ... protest&rdquo;. Earlier that
 month the Apprentice Boys joined the Orange Order, Royal Black
 Preceptory, Official Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party
 in a rally against the Agreement in Coleraine.
</p>
 
<p>
 In response to the disputes surrounding parades the Public Order (N.I)
 Order 1987 came into force requiring prior notification of all parades.
</p>
 
<p>
 At the 1989 Twelfth parade in Portrush the Grand Chaplain of the City
 of Londonderry Orange Lodge and former Moderator of the Presbyterian
 church, Rev. Robert Dickinson, reminded the brethren, &ldquo;We again face
 tyranny, not only from the IRA but a deceitful Government, a European
 Government and the Roman Catholic Church.&rdquo; He went on to accuse the
 Archbishop of Canterbury of &ldquo;hatred of Ulster Protestants&rdquo;.
</p>
 
<p>
 The decision by the Apprentice Boys of Derry to apply to the
 International Fund for Ireland for funding sparked protests at the 1990
 August parade. A number of clubs carried banners demanding, &ldquo;Say No to
 Blood Money&rdquo; while Paisley led a protest at a rally outside the
 courthouse where he claimed that the proposed grant of some #200,000
 was &ldquo;a bribe to get Protestant people involved in the Anglo-Irish
 Agreement&rdquo; . The &lsquo;Boys&rsquo; deny that Paisley may be expelled from the
 organisation because of the protests.
</p>
 
<p>
 On the Lower Ormeau Rd in Belfast five Catholics were murdered in a
 bookies shop by the UDA in February 1992. That July Orangemen march
 past the site of the killings and some of the marchers gave
 five-fingered salutes in mockery of the five dead. The Secretary of
 State, Patrick Mayhew, condemned the actions of some of the marchers
 saying they, &ldquo; would have disgraced a tribe of cannibals&rdquo; but then
 allowed further parades by the Loyal Orders along the Lower Ormeau Rd
 over the next two months. In the week leading up to the July parade
 Orange spokesmen repeated that they could not understand why Catholic
 residents of the area are offended. Earlier that same week, Archie Mc
 Kelvey, an Orangeman of over 40 years standing was expelled from the
 Order for having attended Catholic church services . Riots which
 accompany the annual Twelfth parades in 1992 result in the death of
 Kieran Abram. At the trial for manslaughter of three men accused of
 involvement in his death Justice Mc Collum said of the Twelfth, &ldquo;hatred
 and antagonism are aroused, and the rituals surrounding the activities
 of those preparing for what is supposed to be a celebration, reflect
 the awakening and also the encouragement of those feelings of hatred
 and antagonism&rdquo;. The Grand Lodge of Ireland reacted to the comments
 with &ldquo;incredulity&rdquo;.
</p>
 
<p>
 The publication of the Downing Street Declaration prompted Brother
 Melvin McKendry to warn readers of the Orange Standard &ldquo;... when will
 the majority of people in Northern Ireland realise that while they wish
 to be British, that the Queen, the Government, and the entire
 opposition in Parliament don&rsquo;t want them as part of Britain.&rdquo; which
 meant in effect, &ldquo;Goodbye Northern Ireland, we are rewarding your
 loyalty to our Queen and our country by giving you to Albert Reynolds
 and the terrorists&rdquo; . The Loyal Orders were not however content with
 mere statements opposing the political initiatives of the period. In
 February 1995, the DUP called a meeting of the &lsquo;unionist family&rsquo; at its
 east Belfast headquarters. That the DUP had convened the meeting was
 not unproblematic since the &lsquo;unionist family&rsquo; was in dispute over just
 who was head of the &lsquo;family&rsquo;, Paisley or Molyneaux. The nine
 organisations who attended included the Ulster Unionists, the Popular
 Unionist Party, the Orange Order and the Apprentice Boys of Derry. The
 Governor of the latter organisation, Alistair Simpson, commented, &ldquo;We,
 in the Apprentice Boys, have been calling for the development of a
 united unionist approach for some time, and last week&rsquo;s meeting was a
 welcome move in that direction&rdquo;.
</p>
 
<p>
 Five months after the meeting the first stand-off began at Drumcree
 between Orangemen and the RUC. The Order stressed that it was a
 religious body and again feigned surprise as to why local Catholics
 should resent the parade or the organisation. The resolution passed at
 Drumcree that year stated, &ldquo;We totally condemn the tyrannous and
 unnecessary interference with the peaceful procession returning from a
 Protestant place of worship on the Sabbath Day&rdquo;. One month later, in
 August, the Apprentice Boys of Derry were granted permission to parade
 the full length of the city walls, a move which sparked sit-down
 protests and later led to rioting. The Apprentice Boys maintained that
 they were merely exercising a cultural tradition. The fact that both
 organisations also follow a clearly political agenda was lost in a
 meaningless verbal maze of &lsquo;traditional church parades&rsquo;, &lsquo;civil and
 religious liberty&rsquo; and the &lsquo;inalienable right to march&rsquo;.

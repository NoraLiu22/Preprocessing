<br><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Overview</b></font><ul><br>


Syracuse has seen roughly three periods of high interest in ska music,
much as has the rest of the world it seems.  The first spike of interest
roughly covered the late '80s to early '90s when most shows were happening
at The Haunt in Ithaca, though a steady stream of shows also made it into
Syracuse proper.  There were several local reggae/rock bands, but none
playing ska specifically.  Then the next period coincided with the rise of
local ska band Too Hectic on the Syracuse University campus in Fall 1994.  
By the end of their run in July 1997, they routinely drew 250-300 fans per
show and basically controlled all the local shows, even though other local
bands did exist.  By the following summer, when the big local ska
meetingplace Zopies closed, things were definitely declining
rapidly.<br><br>

The next turning point seemed to be the rise of new high school ska bands
in 1998, which created an entirely new audience for the music locally.  
While these bands were musically rough, they more than made up for it with
raw energy, keeping the newest local ska scene moving forward.  Clearly
this new scene was brought even closer by the establishment of the
Experiments in Ska series by Kingston Beat Productions in late 2000, by giving local bands consistent
access to audiences and touring bands a place to show off new
ideas.<br><br>

<br></ul><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Local History</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><ul><br>

<font size="3"><b><u>preface</b></u></font><br>

The following is merely an attempt to catalog the many local ska shows of
interest and related events and at this time, perhaps reflects at best
maybe 25% of past shows in our area.  It is hoped that different people
will help fill out this history over time and give the newest members of
the local ska scene the benefit of seeing how they fit into the overall
picture.  Please email your information to <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191118054953/mailto:skadanny@gmail.com">skadanny@kingstonbeat.com</a></i> and be as
specific as you can.<br><br>

<a name="80s"></a>
<font size="3"><b><u>late 80s</b></u></font><br>

Many shows happen, but everyone is fuzzy now about exact dates.  FISHBONE
plays several times at Lost Horizon in Syracuse and most ska shows include
the anti-racist skinhead crew RUSH (Racial Unity Skin Heads) from
Rochester as a fixture.  Around 1988, there was a punk show at Club Polski
on Teall Ave in Syracuse featuring the False Prophets and an obscure ska
band from Ottawa.  THE TOASTERS played at the Milky Way (now the
Underground) at the Schine Student Center at Syracuse University.<br><br>


<font size="3"><b><u>1989</b></u></font><br>

Sat, Jul 22nd -- BAD MANNERS (UK ska greats), LAUREL AITKEN (original ska legend from
Jamaica), BIM SKALA BIM (Boston ska pioneers) at the Elks Lodge, 1224 East
Fayette Street, between Pine and Walnut, in Syracuse, near the university.  Laurel Aitken
wasn't scheduled, but stepped off the tour bus and became a surprise last
minute addition.  This was an African-American lodge that hosted many
shows and was later torn down.  Noah Cunningham promoted this show and
lost a lot of money when the turnout was lower than expected.<br><br>

designed the "temporary" logo that lasted for the next 5+ years.<br><br>

after this show.  The festival continued on Saturday as well and included
14 bands overall, including the Stubborn All-Stars, The Slackers, The
Pietasters, and Thumper.<br><br>

show of the SU school year, featuring all 3 bands that started on campus.  
Short Round surprises everyone with clever original songs, a well
choreographed stage show and the ability to draw 100+ all by themselves.  
An impressive debut that in hindsight was essentially the passing of the
torch from Too Hectic (which had already quietly announced their upcoming
breakup). <br><br>

Sun, Jul 13th -- <b>Last show for TOO HECTIC</b> with openers EASTERN
STANDARD TIME and JOHNNY TOO BAD &amp; THE STRIKEOUTS at Hungry Charley's in
